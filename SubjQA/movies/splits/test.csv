Alien was a dark, cold, spartan film set in a bleak, merciless universe. The budget and effects limitations at the time meant that Scott had to use his imagination to create dread. Here he has all the money and effects he can ask for and the resulting film is the polar opposite. Less is more. A filmmaker like Scott should know that. All 4 Alien movies were filmed on a soundstage (save for one 'beach' shot in Alien 3). They were confined and claustrophobic. Prometheus is set in massive, wide-open spaces, which I assume is supposed to make us feel desolate and isolated. But when it cuts back and forth between interior and exterior so much the opposites negate each other, meaning we feel neither confined nor abandoned.The story is set a number of years before Alien in which a bunch of expendable characters (including a lot of nobodies) travel to a distant planet (a 4-year round trip) to find the beings that created life on Earth. When they get there they discover...a load of confusing, muddled nonsense that is far from frightening and is only just barely above mildly interesting.Alien was populated with 7 single or double-syllabled characters that felt real and authentic thanks to their quiet interactions and dialogue. We learned their names and positions quickly. Prometheus has more characters than I can count (some appear out of nowhere and quickly disappear as fast) with some of them not even being coherently named. Not that coherence is this film's strong point.Noomi Rapace is cute as Elizabeth Shaw, the lead scientist who believes in 'The Creators' (the Space Jockey creatures), but she's very miscast. Michael Fassbender as android David is the only other character who gets a notable amount of screen time. You'll care about none of them.Scott once said that the film wasn't a prequel to Alien (after originally announcing that it was) then changed his mind a short while later. If this was supposed to keep us intrigued it didn't work. If anything it only got the confusion going before anyone even saw the movie.It has some lofty ambitions, and succeeds at neither of them. The opening scene of a Creator sacrificing himself at an indefinite point in history to create mankind by putting his DNA into our water is nonsense. Was disintegrating himself the only way of doing this? Could he not have just bled into the primordial soup? Did he create the dinosaurs too? Was it a scene set just after the last ice age? Did they accidentally create primates in the process? Why did they create us in the first place? How did the early civilizations learn of the Creators? Did they visit? Why did they have a star map that led to a planet that was just a testing field?The creation of the famous Xenomorph Alien is so convoluted and preposterous. Let's see if you can follow this:Android David finds a vase of goo in the pyramid/mountain place. He touches it to his finger. He deliberately puts his finger into Holloway's champagne, infecting him as he ingests. Holloway gets sick. Before the symptoms become obvious he mates with his infertile lover Elizabeth. She becomes pregnant and quickly goes into labor. She aborts her 'hell baby' by caesarian section but just leaves it there in the operation room. Some time later the angry Creator is attacked by the full grown hell baby and is consumed by it, to a degree, for unknown reasons. That dead Creator then births a primitive Xenomorph.Pardon me, but that is a load of garbage. I honestly cannot believe something that ludicrous made its way into, what is essentially, an Alien movie. The original had so much purity and mythos. Did Ridley Scott not even watch his own movie for pointers? Lindelof and Spaihts have really painted themselves into a corner with that dumb ending too. When Shaw gets to the real Creator planet she will be the only human being in the film, if that is the way the speculative sequel will go.The mystery of the Space Jockey has been completely ruined.

These few men are the best of the best in making big entertainment, they are Steven Spielberg, James Cameron, Peter Jackson and their inferiors are George Lucas, Michael Bay, Roland Emmerich and many more.  Lucas, a friend of Speilberg, is one of the most derided directors around because of his prequel 'Star Wars' trilogy. Those prequels, although saturated with CGI, aren't that bad but they failed to live up to most expectations.  Michael Bay is an MTV style, action exploitation director, probably the worst big budget filmmaker of his generation. ( Case in point, Armageddon ).  Roland Emmerich made 'Independence Day', a fun popcorn film and three laughable travesties, 'Godzilla', 'The Patriot' and 'The Day After Tomorrow'.  Peter Jackson is one of the most over the top, bloated, CGI happy filmmakers of them all.  Watch the silly 'King Kong' and be introduced to videogame cinema.So that leaves us with the two true superstars.  James Cameron and Steven Spielberg.  Cameron is a very intelligent filmmaker, using special effects for the sole purpose of telling a good story.  His films like 'Aliens' and the first '2 Terminators' are a lot more dangerous and very much anti-establishment than anything Spielberg has ever done.  Cameron also made a 'Gone with the Wind' for this generation in the much praised and much hated 'Titanic'.  That was 8 years ago and Cameron doesn't work as fast as some other directors.  Cameron's next Hollywood movie will be out in 2007, a sci-fi work based on a Japenese comic book.Spielberg then remains the true director of the Hollywood machine, churning out entertainment after entertainment in the seventies, eighties, nineties and today.  Steven's greatest work, the only film you can actually sense is striving towards art is obviously Schindler's List.  It's far superior to everything else Spielberg has ever done, even if it doesn't approach true cinema greatness like 2001: A Space Odyssey, Tokyo Story, Godfather Part 2.After Schindler's list, Spielberg has made one error after another, a long string of idiotic movies, all expertly crafted.The silly sequel to Jurassic Park, 'The Lost World'.  The dull drama 'Amistad', which everyone has trashed, a Hollywood billionaire tackling slavery is not conducive to the making of a great film.  Then the patriotic, flag waiving, cliche of a war movie, 'Saving Private Ryan', a film with two extradionary action scenes and a healthy dose of jingoism and sentimentality. How about 'A.I. Artificial Intelligence', a potentially deep exploration of what makes us human, a film that succeeds on many levels until the inevitable, sappy, Spielberg schmaltz takes over at the end?  'Minority Report', another fascinating science-fiction film with a terrible, ribben bow, happy ending. 'Catch Me If You Can' was fun breezy, entertainment.  'The Terminal' is one of the most half-brained pieces of garbage I've seen in quite some time.Every time Spielberg makes a film, I still hope he might make something great.  I must be stupid.  War of the Worlds is one of the most visceral, assaultive films to come out of Hollywood in years, how joyous it was for me to see it in the movie theater. It makes you wonder at the art of filmmaking, then reality sets in.  The film only works on the perceptive level, scaring sensitive viewers in a post 9/11 world.  Do we care or have sympathy for any of these characters?  No.  I personally wanted the aliens to win, but that's another story.  The people being incinerated, the floating bodies, humanity turning savage for the price of a working car, all this is great work.  Once Tom Cruise gets in that basement with Tim Robbins, the film is as good as dead.The acting by Cruise and Dakota Fanning is very good and John Williams' score is appropriately restrained, the special effects are quite realistic.  This is a great story, so why is Spielberg recycling Jurassic Park's Velociraptors in the basement scene with Tim Robbins?  Why do the aliens look like rejects from Independence Day?  Why does the film end so neatly?  Why does Robbie survive?  Couldn't Spielberg be more brave than that?  Why are the aliens so conveniently destroyed by microbiology? This is 2005, not H.G. Wells, circa 1895 or whenever. The characters are not developed at all, the philosophical undercurrents in the film are not explored. Since there is life outside Earth, does that give us more or less meaning as human beings?  Perhaps the aliens are just in their attempt to destroy us, the hideous predators that we humans truly are? Nothing like this is even remotely approached.It would be too easy to label this film a failure.  I think it succeeds as a sci-fi thriller, for the first 1 hour and 10 minutes, then the movie tapers off and dies a slow death.  This work does not begin to approach the level of art as some very apologetic reviewers have seen fit to define it.And it is not a dismal popcorn movie as some other critics have labeled.  It exists in that realm where many Spielberg films exist, it is good but could have been great if a braver director was at the wheel.The 2-Disc Limited Edition is ok, Spielberg never does commentaries, I applaud him for that.  Picture and sound are fine, special features are vast but superficial.  I'm a huge music fan, so I especially like John Williams discussing his approach to the scoring of the film.  The DVD is overpriced for it's contents.Movie fans everywhere hope for Spielberg to go beyond himself and actually make a great work of art.  Will that ever happen?Probably not.

She has married to provide for her family but, realistically, she would like for things to ""work out"" between the Captain and the rest of the family.

It's the best animated film ever to win an Oscar.So what elevates it from other great animation such as Pixar? It's a combination of many things.Miyazaki's animation feels different to anything else that I've experienced. It's detailed and complex, with well-developed characters, and it has heart. He creates lovable characters, but some have human flaws and they are more real than characters found in most animated fare.Spirited Away tells the story of a 10-year-old girl named Chihiro (Chase). Her parents are driving her to their new home and she's upset about leaving her friends behind. In fact, she's bratty and whines a lot. Her father drives down the wrong road and they end up in an abandoned amusement park. Although it's deserted, they can smell food. Chihiro's parents decide to take advantage of a free meal, but Chihiro doesn't. She's horrified to see them transform into pigs.While she is deciding what to do, a boy named Haku (Marsden) shows up and urges her to leave before it gets dark. She refuses to leave her parents so he decides to help her. Darkness brings a few changes and spirits appear. An area which appeared to be deserted is suddenly alive with light and chatter. Haku explains to Chihiro that she will never be allowed to leave unless she earns her place in the town. To do so, she must seek employment at the bath house.The bath house is run by Yubaba (Pleshette) and she's a formidable witch. But, with the help of Kamaji (Stiers), who takes care of the boiler, Chihiro is given a chance to find a job. She's assigned to Lin, who shows her what to do. Lin also tries to toughen Chihiro up and teach her to improve her sullen attitude and learn some manners. Spirited Away is a coming-of-age story in which Chihiro eventually becomes a happy, confident girl, capable of facing anything.The story is vast and quite complex for an animated film. Miyazaki doesn't rush things and takes a little over two hours to show Chihiro's story. It's aimed at an older audience than films such as Ponyo and My Neighbor Totoro, but it contains some of the beauty and innocence that's present in all Studio Ghibli films.Miyazaki's imagination is almost limitless. You'll meet witches, soot sprites, dragons, spirits, weird animals and a giant baby. I've sometimes heard people complain that they don't understand the story. If you just accept it as a fantasy where magic exists, it's really pretty easy to follow.The style of animation may be different from anything that you are used to. The image is two-dimensional and each frame looks like a watercolor painting. But take note of the amount of detail present in each frame. Some of it doesn't need to be there for the story to work, but it's a richer experience because it is present. When Chihiro nervously edges down a steep flight of stairs, look at the detail in the individual steps. When she puts her shoes on, there's a very human gesture that most animators wouldn't bother with. Spirited Away is clearly a labor of love and a work of art.If you give the film a try, you might find yourself hooked after about two minutes as I was. The look of the film and Joe Hisaishi's score set a mood immediately and draw you in. It's a slightly darker and more dangerous world than many Studio Ghibli settings, but you'll be reluctant to leave. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3420, 3434)",2,0.0,False

Aside from Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter or Hunger Games, bringing ""best-selling fantasy or sci-fi novels"" to the movies never goes well. Yet, that doesn't stop Hollywood making these films. So hitting theaters this weekend is Ender's Game: based on the novel by Orson Scott Card. This big time sci-fi movie featured a big time cast and effects; but could these elements make this novel-based film a must see?If you're like me, then you haven't read the Card's book.So in a case like this, you have to look at film's plot and how it works as a movie. With that said, this how the plot goes:  Ender Wiggen (Asa Butterfield) is a part of a military group that trains young minds to fight against the opposing alien force. Because of Ender's brilliance, Colonel Graff (Harrison Ford) takes a fast interest in the young cadets and see that Ender gets through the ranks so he can become the new hero of Earth.While I'm not sure how this film fairs in translating the novel, I have to say the story does work on the big screen. The only issue I had with the movie is the pacing. As soon as the film starts, Ender's is already an accomplished student. Before you know it he is assigned to fleet training, then he moves to Salamander Squad; and as you turn your head, Ender has is own team. It was hard to get a feel in Ender's progression because the plot was moving so quickly. That out of the way, the story itself was impressive. I liked the themes used in the film, such as the conflict of war and the harshness of training. It was a solid war game plot, despite that the film's story may not have followed the book word through word.Ender's Game feature an impressive looking cast; from young actors to veterans. As casts go, I enjoyed everyone. Asa Buterfield's performance as Ender was reasonable. He could have easily been a generic protagonist, but thanks to Buterfield, Ender was a brilliant cadet full of flaws and conflict.  Opposite to Buterfield was Harrison Ford as Colonel Graff. Ford has proven his worth over the years, but every time he steps into a sci-fi film, it's a treat. The same applies for this film as Ford plays a fully dimensional characer that you can understand and, at times, get behind. While actors like Viola Davis and Ben Kingsley even out the supporting characters, the real surprise came from the cadets. Sure these rookies didn't have loads of screen time, but their performances still worked and I found them just as intriguing as the A-list celebrities.Continuing my impressed feelings about this film, I found Ender's Game to be a technically sound film. Going in, I expected the film to have big effects, but I didn't think they would look as good as they did. Not everything was gorgeous though. There were a few CG shots that could have looked better. Yet, for the most part, the effects blended well with the overall design; making a nice looking film. Steve Jablonsky brought his style to the movie's score, but while I could here Jablonsky's familiar sounds, I thought his overall composing fit the sci-fi film.From the effects to the overall acting, Ender's Game had several great moments. If there were an scenes that stood out to me, it was the zero g training sequences. On several occasions, the cadets would compete against each other in this massive sphere with no gravity. The scenes were impressive by blending good effects with cool war game scenarios. It was like watching the Quidditch matches from the Harry Potter films; only on a bigger scale.When I walked into the theater, I wasn't expecting much from Ender's Game.

In the ultimate  paradox, we find out that it is John's best friend (Michael Bein) who is  actually John's father.Ok, we're in the second movie and now  Schwarzenegger is one of the good guys, sent to protect John as a child as  the T-1000 (a morphing bit of liquid metal that can take on any form) comes  to kill John as a child since the attack on his mother didn't work.The  plot has a billion holes in it... why didn't they just send back a  termiator back to the 1800's a kill John's great, great grandfather  instead. It would have been impossible for people of that time period to  have a defense against the terminator. The terminators have to use the time  machine in the nude, even though they're entirely metal on the inside...  sorry folks, that's just stupid.

Edward  Furlong presents the most convincing performance of a troubled youth who  has grown up without a male role model and looks up to the loyal, yet  emotionless terminator who has come to rescue him and his mother.There  is a lot of violence and tons of language, so this isn't recommended as a  family film... but for sci-fi, special effects junkies, this movie fills  the bill.

In the ultimate  paradox, we find out that it is John's best friend (Michael Bein) who is  actually John's father.Ok, we're in the second movie and now  Schwarzenegger is one of the good guys, sent to protect John as a child as  the T-1000 (a morphing bit of liquid metal that can take on any form) comes  to kill John as a child since the attack on his mother didn't work.The  plot has a billion holes in it... why didn't they just send back a  termiator back to the 1800's a kill John's great, great grandfather  instead. It would have been impossible for people of that time period to  have a defense against the terminator. The terminators have to use the time  machine in the nude, even though they're entirely metal on the inside...  sorry folks, that's just stupid.

Does everybody need explanations spoon fed to them?  I thought horror lied within what we don't fully understand;  The unknown.

He meets and falls in love with a student (Connoly) and they are married and soon she is pregnant.  That's when things get hard.  Nash gets a little paranoid beliveing the Russians are trying to kill him.  Soon he is in the hospital undergoing some primative electric-type therapy to cure him of his mental state.  The balance of the movie shows Nash's road to redemption and that road is long, hard and bumpy, but worth the ride.

ILM again comes through with the best CGI money can buy, this time with a winner of film for a change. It also looks as if Robert Downey Jr. (an actor I had always liked) is back in his game. His unfortunate downward spiral in the mid 90's up through the last several years nearly destroyed his acting career. I hope this time around, he's here to stay.So, getting to the ""main course"" Tony Stark is a billionaire engineer genius/philanthropist and has  been compared to the likes of Leonardo Davinci. His inherited genius comes from his father who started it all designing weapons for the military where he picked up and designed some of the worlds most destructive weapons of war.During one of his excursions and promotional gigs to ""sell"" his new ""bang, bang"" toy, he is kidnapped during an ambush where he is forced to make the same weapon for ""the enemy"" that will be used on theirs. Stark decides to do something else, and in of all places, makes his greatest creation to free himself from captivity....""the suite"" which is a crude form of what will be his masterpiece.Upon his escape and back home, he has an epiphany. Instead of making weapons of death and destruction for the military, he wants to design things to help mankind and put an end to war. This does not settle well with his business partner Obadiah, played by the excellent Jeff Bridges who has ""alternate"" plans. There he designs the suit of all suits through trial an error to put a stop to his weapons being sold and placed in the wrong hands and defend those who need it the most. This immediately put him in the wrong cross hairs of everyone. Soon Obadiah discovers what Stark has created and copies his suit design, only far more destructive and menacing.Well worth watching, Iron Man finishes SOLID. Downey 's character has some great lines and lots of dry, sarcastic and quirky humor. It keeps a good flow through the entire film from start to finish. Of course in this day an age in film making, Iron Man finishes with the hint (and most likely the promise) of continuing stories to come in the future. Well worth seeing for the theater experience, this is not one to miss folks. Saddle up for some hard hitting action and a bitch'in good time. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2508, 2522)",1,0.0,False

From the way it was written, shot, scored and acted there is for me no doubt it's just simply perfection. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. The phone calls may not be the scariest in the sense that the caller at first doesn't say anything threatening or even sexual.Each minute of the first act raises the tension unlike any horror flick I have ever seen. By the time you reach the end of the first act you'll be held in such suspense that scaring you is now simple. Any filmmaker can create a jump scene where the killer or ghost or whatever pops out of the corner. Most of the time jumping back is just simply a reaction. How many movies have you watched where you jumped back, but weren't scared at all? It's just a reaction and any filmmaker can do that regardless if they are good or a hack.That is why I normally prefer movies like this that are a bit more subtle. Problem is though after the opening act business does indeed slow down. Most people say the middle sections are boring and it's kind of hard to argue with them. Though I will say the middle sections of When a Stranger Calls does get better on multiple viewings. The filmmakers did such a great job in the opening act that we the audience are on such a high that anything afterwards is bound to be a let down.The screenplay written by Steve Feke and Fred Walton was overall pretty good; the first act was very well written and extremely creepy, but after that the movie changes focus. It seems the story will be built around Jill Johnson played by Carol Kane, but instead the movie focuses on the killer Roy Duncan played by Tony Beckley and a private detective named John Clifford played by Charles Durning who is on the hunt for the psychotic killer.When a Stranger Calls isn't the typical horror movie, yes I consider it a horror flick for the sole reason the movie does aim to scare you. Not in the typical horror movie way, but with more suspense. Some suspense flicks have nothing to do with horror where as others play off some kind of primal fear often found in the horror genre. The 2nd half becomes more of a crime drama. We follow Roy Duncan and to be honest the guy is quite pathetic.Feke and Walton take an interesting approach; Duncan is obviously a psycho but he's so pathetic we almost feel sorry for him. But the man is a child killer and I cannot feel for them. They are the lowest of the low. He's homeless, broke we see him get beat up and later beg for money. Hardly the typical movie villain; problem though is he's just not an interesting enough character to follow around. Tony Beckley does an out-standing job. There is no denying his talents in this movie as an actor. But the character just simply was not interesting.Charles Durning does a great job though at carrying the movie. He is the more interesting of the two characters and his obsession with finding the killer is entertaining. But what went wrong with the middle sections? Simple it goes back to the killer just not being interesting enough. For almost an hour of the movie it's John Clifford hunting down Roy Duncan. While it's not as boring as some people make it out to be, I do think Steve Feke and Fred Walton could have done more. Their screenplay does seem to drag in some spots and by a certain point the movie does sort of repeat itself, but thankfully the final act gets back to Jill Johnson.I didn't hate the middle sections, but they weren't as strong as they could have been. I personally always felt the movie should have been Jill's story with Roy Duncan being in the movie a little less. It would suck to lose the scenes with Charles Durning because he was so great same goes for Tony Beckley, but I personally think making it Jill's story and use Clifford and Duncan as more of a sub-plot would have worked better. The remake attempted to do just that and failed big time.As stated earlier the opening act was just brilliant; director Fred Walton gets the most out of every single shot and raises the suspense and tension unlike any movie I have ever seen. Like I said anybody can do a clich&eacute;d scare movie, but it takes real talent to do what Fred Walton did. The 2nd half while yes does lose a little bit of steam, Fred Walton is still able to keep the suspense level at a decent level. The scenes with Colleen Dewhurst who plays Lisa are well done overall and remind us what kind of movie we are watching. The hour mark features a great and creepy scene with her and Roy Duncan. Though when all is said and done the Lisa character seems nothing more than filler scenes. It never really goes anywhere, but does provide some decent suspense.The final act is when things really pick up and we return to Jill Johnson who is now married with 2-kids of her own. Besides the opening act, the final act is the most solid. It goes back to being very creepy and while it does lack compared to the opening it does give us some chills and thrills. Like I said before I do believe When a Stranger Calls is a movie that needs multiple viewings. The opening act was so brilliant anything afterwards is bound to bet a let down. It might be boring at first, but when you see it again you might be able to appreciate it a little bit more. I've come to enjoy the middle sections even if it wasn't as good as it could have been.Carol Kane was great and I do believe the movie might have worked better had the focus been more on her and use Duncan and Clifford as a sub-plot. Kane does appear in half the movie actually. It's just she's used in the opening and ending, which results in roughly 40-minutes or so screen time, but since it's so far between it seems like she's barley in the movie.Despite some problems with the middle sections, When a Stranger Calls is a highly suspenseful and very creepy movie with excellent performances. I'd advise those who felt the middle sections were boring to give it another try. It does grow on you and for those who haven't seen it just expect more a crime/drama with some suspense thrown in during the middle. But the opening and closing act just might be the best you'll find in this genre. ANSWERNOTFOUND",excellent,"(5975, 5984)",1,1.0,True

In my opinion, the 3D made the movie too dark and the 48 fps made it appear too much like a TV soap, too fake. That obviously colored my impressions of the film. Despite this, I am reviewing the movie in general, not the 3D or 48 fps viewing, because you'll always have the option to view the movie in the regular version (as it should be viewed).With that said, here are some of my thoughts:STORY/BOOK ADAPTATIONI'm torn over how to assess the adaptation of the book. There are a lot of features I really liked and some I hated. Parts of the movie are very faithful to the book, and those parts generally work well. However, the changes to the book don't work nearly so well. While I was fine with the changes in the LOTR movies, the changes Jackson made in the Hobbit seemed unnecessary. Unlike in the LOTR films, where changes often condensed plot points because the books were too long, most of the changes in the Hobbit added to the story. Moreover, most of the changes in the Hobbit didn't do much to advance character development.***SPOILERS AHEAD***The movie takes an hour to get started with scenes of Bilbo talking to Frodo and then a flashback to the unexpected party. While I liked each scene individually, the frame narrative and the unexpected party took a bit too long. Unlike the intro scenes in the LOTR Fellowship of the Ring, there's a lot of dialogue but relatively little information revealed. Viewers learn surprisingly little about the dwarves or the quest (of course, aside from the excellent prologue scene featuring the attack on Erebor).Right after the Trolls, there's a scene in which a band of Orcs chase the dwarves (similar to the added chase scene in LOTR Two Towers with the men of Rohan and Orcs). This seemed like it was simply a way to heighten the tension and excitement in the film. However, it was wholly unnecessary as the Troll scene was frightening enough. The scene eventually has to be resolved through a series of awkward interventions, from Radagast outracing the Wargs on his bunny sleigh to a hunting party of Rivendell Elves. The whole sequence could have been cut with no loss.My biggest critique is the whole Azog subplot. In the book, Azog was an Orc chieftain during the Battle of Azanulbizar and was slain by Dain. He was also father of Bolg. That's it. However, now in the movie the Necromancer has revived Azog from the dead and he's got a grudge against Thrain. Obviously, Peter Jackson & Co felt like the film needed a chief villain, but Azog just becomes too much a part of the story. LOTR was excellent at putting an Orc chieftain in the spotlight for the purposes of creating a chief villain for a scene, without allowing them to become the focus of the scene (think Lurtz, Gothmog, etc). I'd have much preferred the excellent Goblin King to have played a larger role.I loved the Goblin Town and the Riddles in the Dark scenes. Goblin Town looked great, almost like a beehive. Despite my initial misgivings about the design of the Goblin King as a HUGE Goblin, I loved the character on screen. His mix of humor and threat fits the tone of the Hobbit perfectly. If anything, I felt he was underutilized.Riddles in the Dark was actually fairly faithful to the book. However, the choreography is superb, with the characters constantly moving, pacing, or confronting each other while reciting the riddles. The directing keeps the scene visually interesting without distracting from the riddling.Despite the press attention he got, I really didn't come away with strong opinions about Radagast the Brown. I thought Sylvester McCoy did a decent job playing the role, but he wasn't a highlight. I like the Dr. Doolittle motif of his talking with the animals. His sole role seems to have been informing Gandalf about Dol Guldur, but it's a bit confusing why Gandalf wouldn't know given that he had visited Thrain there. I do hope we get more of Radagast in the next two films, but I also won't feel I missed out on too much if we don't.***END SPOILER ALERT***As I said above, I felt overall the departures from the book didn't enhance the story, unlike the case with the LOTR films, where I could understand most of the creative decisions Jackson & Co made.CHARACTERS/ACTINGI generally have positive things to say here. Martin Freeman was a convincing Bilbo. While he's not nearly so lovable as the Hobbit quartet from the first film, he has some great humorous moments. However, where Freeman really shines is in his ability to mix the ""Took"" (adventurous) and ""Baggins"" (domesticated) sides of his nature seamlessly so to speak. Bilbo doesn't start off as just a timid burgher, and he doesn't just become an action hero. His character feels real.With a huge caveat. In the book, Bilbo's moment of decision and courage comes when he faces the spiders in Mirkwood. By contrast, in this movie, there is another moment at the end where Bilbo charges several Orcs. It seemed like a step a bit too far for the character at this point in the story. After all, it's one thing for him to attack spiders while he's wearing the ring, but another to attack huge Orc and Wargs without invisibility. The scene was a Jackson & Co. addition and it just didn't fit. I understand they wanted to end the movie with Bilbo having a heroic moment, but it went too far.I was pleasantly surprised by Richard Armitage's Throrin. I was a bit leery that he would be too much the action hero, but Armitage deftly gives Throrin a complex character - arguably more complex than Throrin's character in the book. Armitage's Throrin is coldly bitter, but also loyal towards his men. Armitage doesn't overdo the bitterness, but it's a presence on the screen.The other 12 dwarves really didn't get a chance to do much. As an ensemble, they worked well at the beginning in the unexpected party, making a mess of Bilbo's house. However, once they leave the Shire, only Kili and Bofur stand out. Bofur is obviously being set up as somebody who will develop a friendship with Bilbo, while Kili is often the dwarf used to advance plot points.I don't fault the movie for not distributing screen time more evenly. After all, in the Hobbit book, Tolkien basically ignores all of the dwarves aside from Throrin. Jackson probably does a better job incorporating the leftover 12 dwarves feel relevant. However, the group is not yet an ensemble. It feels like Bilbo, Throrin, Gandalf, Bofur, Kili, and a few other dwarves. Unlike the Fellowship of the Ring movie, viewers probably won't feel attached to every member of the group.SPECIAL EFFECTSGenerally, the film had the strong special effects we've all come to expect from Weta Workshops. Gollum looked even more realistic than he did in the LOTR movies. I though most of the CGI Goblins looked fine. The Misty Mountains Goblins were tiny and CGI was probably the right choice.However... Azog looked horrible. He was CGI and it showed. His body was far too smooth, just smooth and white. Basically, he looked like a Vampire Orc. The character had absolutely no stage presence when confronting the real actors.The other special effect critique was the size of the dwarves, particularly in Rivendell. Throrin goes from too tall to too short within a matter of minutes (when they're reading the Moon runes). It really pulled me out of the movie for a bit. I don't ever remember thinking about the size of the dwarves and hobbits in LOTR. That's something I hope Jackson corrects for the DVD release.OVERALLThe Hobbit is a worthy prequel to the LOTR films. Make no mistake, the Hobbit is NOT The Phantom Menace equivalent to the Original Trilogy. Nonetheless, I didn't come away nearly so wowed. Perhaps the expectations were set too high. Perhaps it's because I made the mistake of watching the movie in 3D and 48 fps. However, there were also some plot changes that I felt didn't add much. Ultimately, I think the Hobbit would actually have been better served as two rather than three films with the added scenes left on the cutting room floor.

No, they don't make movies like they used to, and as far as I'm concerned, that's to the good- I much prefer movies made from 1965 on, for the most part.  However, there are certain films, such as Rear Window, that you recognize could never be made in this era where special effects, short attention spans, and cheap thrills, dominate the suspense/horror genre, and you have to sigh nostalgically, even if, like me, you weren't alive during the period of cinema for which you are yearning.  Fortunately, you can pop in the excellent DVD release of this classic Hitchock film anytime you like and be taken back to a time where, indeed, they still made movies like they used to.I don't see how you could not like this film.  As far as the acting goes, James Stewart is great as the crusty photographer with a broken leg and nothing to do but spy on his neighbors.  Meanwhile, the female lead, Grace Kelley, has the best role in the film, and she assumes it brilliantly.  Grace plays the woman of every man's dreams: heart-breakingly beautiful, kind, smart, and, as we find out in the film's climax, tough as nails.That said, the real star of this film is Hitchock, who once again advances the art of filmmaking with his unique sense of macabre and technical expertise.  The story here is mainly existential rather than suspenseful.  The act of violence around which the film is centered is the most chilling example of the darkness of modern/postmodern existence, but each apartment into which James Stewart looks provides both James and the viewer with some very dark insight into the pain, the banality, and the frustration and isolation, that has become ingrained into life as we know it.

It truly conveys the anguish most involved experienced - not just Jesus and his followers.  For those who claim that His message is missed in the film, I call your attention to the last moments on the Cross when the other men there had the chance to choose their path - the redemption one received while the other continued to ridicule.  That is the bottom line message - the redemption and forgiveness that is available to all.I have seen many reviews that criticize Mel for making it too violent.  I find this ironic.  Have you watched the violence out there on film, in video games, even on TV?  I certainly have plenty of it in my film library.  Our culture has become immune to it.  I expect that had the violence not been portrayed so graphically the film would have lost substantial impact.  That said, it was the most difficult film I have ever watched and I cried throughout the film in the theater, but I purchased the DVD.

If you choose not to believe that Jesus was who he was portrayed as in ""The Passion of the Christ"" and in the Bible, that is your opinion and you are welcome to it.  But save the intellectual drivel about how anyone who does believe is deluded and cannot think for themselves.  Learn to read and research and you might be surprised at what you learn.  And - By the way - I am a Christian (NOT Catholic) who was brought up Unitarian.  I know how to read and think for myself!  I'm not being blindly lead.  Free will is a basic point of Faith.  I use my free will to believe.  You use yours to ridicule.  I'm sad for you.In terms of visual message, this film was spectacular.  The cinematography is amazing.  It truly conveys the anguish most involved experienced - not just Jesus and his followers.  For those who claim that His message is missed in the film, I call your attention to the last moments on the Cross when the other men there had the chance to choose their path - the redemption one received while the other continued to ridicule.  That is the bottom line message - the redemption and forgiveness that is available to all.I have seen many reviews that criticize Mel for making it too violent.  I find this ironic.  Have you watched the violence out there on film, in video games, even on TV?  I certainly have plenty of it in my film library.  Our culture has become immune to it.  I expect that had the violence not been portrayed so graphically the film would have lost substantial impact.  That said, it was the most difficult film I have ever watched and I cried throughout the film in the theater, but I purchased the DVD.  I will watch it again when I feel I need to be reminded of the sacrifice that was made on the behalf of all who believe - and all who do not.

I am a massive Kubrick fan, and I could barely sleep the week this film was released. Seeing the opening credits have me fidgeting in my seat. And seeing ""a film by Stanley Kubrick"" was heartwarming.  And I wasn't disappointed. Again, even after his death, Mr. Kubrick managed to confound expectations yet again. Why did people hate this film? Pacing, no really hot sex, slow, long....I don't know.  All I know is that I loved it, and it's one of Kubrick's best.  He really creates a great dreamlike atmosphere that creates a sense of dread and claustrophobia.

It's a universal struggle, and that there will always be conflict between men and women.  This is one of Kubrick's most visually stunning films, shot mostly in primary colors.  There are 4 sequences that equal the great sequences in other Kubrick films.  First, the opening party sequence is gorgeously shot and edited, the orgy scene, the scene in the hotel with Alan Cumming majorly flirting with Cruise (it's absolutely hilarious), and the climatic scene between Cruise and Pollack.  These 4 scenes are quite long, but they are so well put together and really create a tension (especially the Cruise/Pollack one) that transfixes you.  As for the controversy as to whether this film is actually Kubrick's final cut, it is.  I recently saw Leon Vitali, Kubrick's long time assistant, at the Lincoln Center in NYC and he said this was the final cut of the film.  Aside from the digital figures inserted into the film to avoid the NC-17 rating, it wasn't altered in any way.  Reportedly, this new 2 disc edition is the NC-17, unaltered director's cut of the film, which is a wonderful development (I have seen the unaltered orgy sequence before, and the digital figures are annoying in the censored version).  The cut that Terry Semel, Bob Daly, Tom Cruise, and Nicole Kidman saw 4 days before Stanley died was the film he wanted to be played in cinemas.

Like looking back on a relationship that went south and wishing you could have just avoided the whole thing, that is what season 6 does to what was a great story. I am so glad I never bought the previous seasons because this season makes everything, EVERYTHING, that happened in the previous seasons pointless. I was sad when Cheers ended, sad again when Friends ended, and sorry to see Ally McBeal go too. This was the first ending to a show that left me mad. By the first few episodes I was already frustrated at all the ""new stuff"" they were adding but still I could not bring myself to believe the guys who created this wonderful story would fail so enormously in the ending.

Simply because I wanted to enjoy it as what it is, rather than a revisited English version of a same film. Unfortunately, I found comparisons to be inevitable. Not saying that ""The Ring"" is either superior or inferior, but it stayed very truthful to the original material it was based on, too truthful.For viewers who haven't had a chance to see ""Ringu"", you will find idea of ""The Ring"" wholly unique, nevertheless bizarre and ridiculous at the same time, depending on your cynicism level. But for those who have seen the original, you may think that the story of this US remake unfolds in an almost identical way, even though some incidents along the way were inserted or slightly altered to cater for the vaster audiences. In certain cases these alterations are actually an improvement that contributes to the mood of the story, as well as providing hints and clues of the final conclusion. In Japan, like in China and many other countries in Asia, they have long history that consists of countless mythical tales and legends about the spiritual realm, so a cursed video may seem vividly possible, while seems far-fetched and hard to swallow to the English-speaking world. But in order to retain that sense of myth, a lot of elements converted (or rather not converted) into the US version do feel quite out of place.Verbinski, while flaring some ingenious camera setups, did not tackle the subtlety a movie that is largely atmospheric requires. ""The Ring"" is a material which M. Night Shyamalan could probably do while he sleepwalks, and his knack for psychological thrills and minimalism style would surely be effective here. Perhaps looking at Verbinski's r&eacute;sum&eacute; (Mousehunt, The Mexicans), he may be too cynical for a subject that deals with a video tape that kills people. However with the limited amount of Gore (no puns intended), he did succeed in letting some genuine chills creep into the audiences at the sublimal level.Where ""The Ring"" did fail is, not having convincing characters. Naomi Watts serves up a decent job as a career-driven news reporter, but she did not look frightened or concerned enough for a single-mother who knows her exact time and date of death. There was no sense of emergency that she is desperate to find out how to lift the curse, instead she spends the entire time questioning who was involved in the sad story behind the video. By the end of the seventh day the audiences are left to wander off somewhere forgetting why she needs to find out about the origin of the video in the first place. Secondly the son Aidan is too creepy, and without a trace of innocence for us to really care about what will happen to him. He shares no chemistry with his mother, spending the entire time staring into the far place, drawing dark pictures, or mumbling something about a imaginary friend. In another word, he seems more like a possessed puppet than your little nephew you would like to take to the carnival. In Alejandro Amenavar's ""The Others"", in Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"", or even in the most obvious example, Shyamalan's ""The Sixth Sense"", children's straightforward manner and innocence proved to be far more effective in creating sense of peril, and in that matter, way more disturbing. Another disappointing performance is from Martin Henderson as Noah. He has great presence, but again he does not convey any chemistry with the other actors in the film. The expression he has for not believing the nonsense of a killer video is not so different from the one he knows his life could be in threat. Is he helping Rachel because he does have feelings for her, or does he just hope to get laid again because she is still hot? It was not explained, nor do we really care much.Though the number of extras on this DVD is disappointing, what it does offer is in fact quite neat. The picture is sharp and crisp, providing a good contrast of the grayish grim look of the film, with the bursting colors at times that will permanently damage your retina (in some way it actually distracts you from the mood the film is supposed to have). While the sound may not give your system a throughout workout, the localization is quite well defined, and provide a good dimension for the otherwise monotone sound effects, therefore making the few shock-tricks exceptionally powerful (needless to say the DTS track again proves to be the champion of cinema sound).An advertised ""never-before-seen short film"" could be seen by selecting the ""Don't look here"" option on the main menu. It is in fact a collection of deleted and extended scenes, featuring a few more graphic sequences trimmed from the theatrical release. Without commentary or additional information, it doesn't really reveal any more insights or secret than the film itself, but would definitely affect the rating if they were incorporated back into the film as an ""uncut edition"". Yet whether it would be a better viewing experience is another question. Also included is a very brief trailer of the original ""Ringu"" on DVD (also released by Dreamworks, surprise, surprise!), a theatrical trailer of ""Catch Me If You Can"", and an ""8 Mile"" DVD promo spot. If you are patient enough to play around with the remote a little bit more, you may find a not so pleasant easter egg!

I hope to change that someday, because it is a city full of history, and I personally have a healthy appreciation for history and the way in which it shapes the world in which we live and the people who we become.Before I confuse you, allow me to point out that Silver Linings Playbook is not a movie about history. But it is a movie set in Philadelphia. And while I've never been there, I have developed a healthy hatred for it. You may say that hatred is baseless, but I say you've never met someone from Philly. Or you're from Philly and lack proper perspective. Admittedly, nearly all of my interaction with Philadelphia and its residents has, to this point in my life, revolved around sports. But Philadelphia athletes do things like electrocute dogs (I will kindly ignore you as you point out he was an Atlanta athlete while he was electrocuting dogs, because we had the benefit of ignorance), and Philadelphia fans are widely acknowledged to be the worst in sports (unless you're from Philly... then they're awesome).You may be wondering why I should be suggesting that you not see a movie because it is set in a city you may or may not hate based almost solely on its relationship with sports. My response would be that Philly is a sports city, and it is defined in major part by its relationship with its sports. Accordingly, this movie, through its characterizations, very much relates to Philadelphia's relationships with its sports. So if you are like me and have a healthy distaste for Philadelphia, its people, or its sports, you may want to avoid watching this.Why you should see it:I said that Silver Linings isn't a movie about history, and that's true. Nor is it explicitly about Philadelphia. But it is a story about people who are the product of Philadelphia's history, and because of that, it couldn't be set anywhere else. Other films have settings that are merely the time and place in which the plot unfolds, but this is a plot that couldn't exist outside of its setting. The result is a story that is unique and compelling to me and yet all too familiar to many Philadelphians.Bradley Cooper has seemingly made a career of playing jerks in his movies, and that actually hasn't changed here. Maybe that's because he's a jerk in real life (you'll never guess the city from which he hails... Philadelphia!). Anyway, in this movie it's almost as if his jerk personality is put back in its natural environment, and the result is a jerk you can pull for. I don't necessarily think he had to stretch his acting abilities all that far to appear in this, but he still does a fantastic job of portraying a man who is wholly unlike me but still completely relatable.You can still get in on the ground floor of Jennifer Lawrence appreciation, since she's only been around for two years. But in those two years, she has two deserved best actress nominations (one of them here) and two roles in fan-pleasing box office genre movies. If she isn't on the fast track to becoming one of Hollywood's (much needed) leading ladies, I just don't know what to say. In Silver Linings, she plays a sort of mirror to Bradley's character, and likewise nails the jerk-for-whom-you-wish-good-things part (and yet she's from Kentucky... go figure).Aside from the two main characters, there are still a few other noteworthy members of the cast. It appears as though this was an opportunity jumped on by Robert DeNiro to get back to quality acting, and I have to say that I've never before been genuinely entertained by Chris Tucker until now. I won't say that they offer any sort of counterbalance or opposition to the off-kilter nature of Cooper or Lawrence, because they don't. Everyone in this film is off his or her rocker at least a little bit, and that's the point.In short:I spent the entirety of Silver Linings torn between wanting to know what happens next and still not wanting to see what happens next. The unorthodoxy of the two leads draws me in in a way that I haven't experienced in a while, and I appreciate the opportunity to care about such flawed individuals. I don't believe Cooper had to reach to play his character, but that doesn't diminish his portrayal at all, and Lawrence keeps step with him the entire time. In the end, I think nothing more than spite for the city of Philly made me leave the rating for this one at an 8 out of 10 instead of more, but I still recommend it for anyone who can enjoy a completely unusual romantic comedy. At least I think that's what it is... I don't know what other category it would fit into.Exceptions to the recommendation:- anyone with a jealous wife or girlfriend who might make assumptions about why you're watching Jennifer Lawrence in this movie;- anyone with a jealous husband or boyfriend who might make assumptions about why you're watching Bradley Cooper in this movie;- if you think dancing scenes are stupid and contrived when added into romantic comedies;- people who would like to go on thinking that they're the ones with problems;- anyone who can't handle awkwardness fueled by inappropriate comments;- if you really do have a seething hatred for the City of Brotherly Love.

The Mission: Impossible franchise has run the gauntlet as far as successes and failures go; I thoroughly enjoy the original Mission: Impossible, I despise the sequel, and I'm relatively indifferent to the third film aside from its fantastic villain in the form of Philip Seymour Hoffman.  The franchise returns to the screen five years after M:I-3 and an entire fifteen years after the original hit theaters in May of 1996.  After the somewhat disappointing box office returns for M:I-3 and the lackluster performance of Cruise's Knight and Day there was talk of Tom Cruises's days as an action star being over.  Ghost Protocol proved to be just the boost Cruise's career needed as M:I-4 went on to be the most successful film in the franchise so far.Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol isn't my favorite film of the franchise but it is certainly the best of the sequels.While Ghost Protocol is a relatively good film where it really gets to shine is on Blu-ray. It is simply put one of the best demo discs you can add to your collection as it is as close to video and audio perfection as you're about to find.  I can't find one technical flaw with picture quality.  Black levels are inky across the board, flesh tones are accurate, and I spotted no instances of edge enhancement or artifacting even during the tricky sand storm sequence which could have been a disaster.My only gripe with the video presentation of M:I-4 has nothing to do with the actual disc released, which again is fabulous, but concerns the fact that there isn't even an option to purchase a version of Ghost Protocol that includes the astonishing IMAX footage.  After the success of releasing The Dark Knight, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, and Tron: Legacy with their IMAX footage intact I'm dumbfounded by the studio and director Brad Bird's decision not to at least give fans a choice to purchase an IMAX version.  The advertising for the theatrical release of Ghost Protocol leaned heavily on the IMAX footage angle and received a lot of praise critically especially for the Burj Khalifa tower sequence which was edge gripping to say the least.  The lack of IMAX footage obviously didn't affect my score of Ghost Protocol but it's still disappointing that the nearly 30 minutes of IMAX footage was unceremoniously left out.Like the video transfer the 7.1 Dolby TrueHD soundtrack is also demo worthy.  From as soon as the Paramount mountain disappears the audio assault begins; gun shots, explosions, car crashes, and everything in between will give your surround speakers and subwoofer a real workout.  Not only does the track come alive during the many action sequences but even during the calmer moments the track is full of subtlety and precision.  The revamped theme sounds better than ever, the Dubai dust storm is an auditory tour de force, and the fight scenes pack plenty of punch no pun intended.  Even with all the action the dialogue is always crystal clear and the front sound stage is well balanced.  Ghost Protocol simply sounds amazing; even with the volume turned up high it never gets out of control and you shouldn't have to fidget with the volume level at all.The special features included on this release are a little light surprisingly with all the extras being found on the main disc with the second disc being a DVD copy of the film.  An UltraViolet Digital Copy & a normal Digital Copy are also housed on the DVD copy.  Four  HD documentaries of varying length are included; Heating Up in Dubai (17 min), Vancouver Fisticuffs (12 min), The Sandstorm (3 min), and Props (3 min).  Also included are 15 minutes of Deleted Scenes with optional commentary with Director Brad Bird also presented in HD.  Strangely there is no feature commentary with Brad Bird which seems like a glaring omission.This newest entry into the Mission: Impossible franchise is the best film of the franchise since the original but is easily the best Blu-ray of the series.  The included special features are a little light but that can be overlooked because of the amazing video and audio presentation which is flawless.  Inclusion of the IMAX footage would have been a nice bonus; I simply don't understand why it wasn't included but perhaps a future Blu-ray release will include it.  Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to enjoy Tom Cruise's best film in almost a decade before he ""self destructs"" again. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(5034, 5048)",1,0.0,False

Even with all the action the dialogue is always crystal clear and the front sound stage is well balanced.  Ghost Protocol simply sounds amazing; even with the volume turned up high it never gets out of control and you shouldn't have to fidget with the volume level at all.The special features included on this release are a little light surprisingly with all the extras being found on the main disc with the second disc being a DVD copy of the film.  An UltraViolet Digital Copy & a normal Digital Copy are also housed on the DVD copy.  Four  HD documentaries of varying length are included; Heating Up in Dubai (17 min), Vancouver Fisticuffs (12 min), The Sandstorm (3 min), and Props (3 min).  Also included are 15 minutes of Deleted Scenes with optional commentary with Director Brad Bird also presented in HD.  Strangely there is no feature commentary with Brad Bird which seems like a glaring omission.This newest entry into the Mission: Impossible franchise is the best film of the franchise since the original but is easily the best Blu-ray of the series.  The included special features are a little light but that can be overlooked because of the amazing video and audio presentation which is flawless.  Inclusion of the IMAX footage would have been a nice bonus; I simply don't understand why it wasn't included but perhaps a future Blu-ray release will include it.  Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to enjoy Tom Cruise's best film in almost a decade before he ""self destructs"" again. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(5034, 5048)",1,0.0,False

While the well-deserved iconic status of the original trilogy cannot be seriously ascribed to any of the later films (hence my four-star rating rather than five), repeated viewings reveal ATTACK OF THE CLONES to be far more thoughtfully written than either its dismally weak predecessor THE PHANTOM MENACE or its pompous, chaotic successor REVENGE OF THE SITH.PHANTOM MENACE seems largely to have been intended as a children's film; even the child actor selected to play Anakin was far too young to make the chronology believable, but the apparently intended audience could easily relate to him. With its flaccid, pointless characters and cheap-looking CGI effects done for their own sake, it plays like Saturday morning kids' TV. I note that many of the Amazon reviews read: ""My 5-year-old loved it."" So if a kids' movie was George Lucas' intent, he was almost successful, although I can't imagine how a kid would react to the traumatic image of the slave-child Anakin being torn from his slave-mother Shmi, the one heart-rending dramatic element in the film--never resolved properly.  Except for that image, adults have a very difficult time with this bloated 137-minute unfunny cartoon, its main character clearly the grating Jar Jar Binks--who is given a rather racist characterization.Episode III--REVENGE OF THE SITH, for all its hype, simply doesn't work because Anakin's reactions are unbelievable. Lured by Palpatine's mendacious promise that Siths can ""prevent the ones they care about from dying""--playing to Anakin's obsession, he joins Palpatine/Sidious' violent galactic takeover, even *after* that pivotal promise is revealed as a bald lie by Palpatine: ""only one Sith lord has ever been able to [prevent death], but together we *may* be able to save Padme."" Anakin's capitulation *despite that revelation* destroys the viewer's belief in the drama. Anakin's seduction is a core theme of Lucas' 28-year project, and to see its key scene written so very unconvincingly is shocking.In Episode II--ATTACK OF THE CLONES, I feel that we are given the only honestly realized glimpse of a chapter in Anakin's life. One would place his age at perhaps seventeen and Padme's at a youthful twenty-two. Neither have had experience in love, so their pain, confusion, and difficult, awkward verbal exchanges are entirely credible and even endearing. Critics seem to have missed it altogether: Hayden Christensen is accused of being ""wooden,"" but he is tapping into typical teenage experiences of first love--which were perhaps only a few years away in his own 20-year-old life. There is a rare authenticity--which the critics naturally missed. It is only in this film where we believe that Anakin is torn between the Jedi--who show him no respect, treating him both patronizingly and suspiciously, refusing to empathize with the realities of his tender age and hard past life (though ""empathy"" is supposedly critical in the Jedi credo)--and the possibility of another way, dangled before him through Palpatine's blandishments. The fact that the liberation of Anakin's enslaved mother is not even an issue for the Jedi paints them as abominably callous--and possibly sexist; her cruel death, achingly difficult to watch, and which Anakin is in no position to prevent, would embitter anyone toward the Jedi. It is only by *remembering* these points that one is able to believe in Anakin's final, tragic seduction by Palpatine in the third film, even though REVENGE itself actually sabotages this eloquent groundwork with horrendous writing that logically would have Anakin grudgingly decide to remain in the Jedi fold as the lesser evil, about 70 minutes into the film. With some humorous touches reminiscent at times of STAR WARS (1977), and the unusually careful set-up I described, ATTACK OF THE CLONES must be deemed the only successful film of the three prequels.Filmed digitally, theatrical presentations, transferred to standard film, were said to be disappointing. Ironically, the DVD is the natural medium for ATTACK OF THE CLONES, and it looks splendid in anamorphic widescreen. Like all the later STAR WARS films, it is loaded with extras, all interesting once, and delivered with an annoying self-congratulatory tone by Lucas and company.

A family-friendly film, Despicable Me follows Gru, an evil super villain, as he adopts three girls with hopes of using them to one-up a rival super villain.  Instead, he falls into the role of devoted father, giving up on his evil ways.  Most notably, the film also introduces the Minions - Gru's short, yellow workers that speak gibberish and often find themselves engaging in an endless amount of comical hijinks.  Now, Gru and his Minions are back, along with Agnes, Edith, and Margo in the animated sequel, Despicable Me 2.Directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud return to direct Despicable Me 2, which once again stars Steve Carrell as Gru - a now retired super-villain that's attempting to create his own brand of jelly.  At the same time, a mysterious villain has stolen a chemical recipe that can turn living things into indestructible purple killing machines.  Desperate to stop the mysterious villain, the Anti-Villain League (AVL) enlists Gru's help, pairing him with an AVL agent, Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wigg), to track down the villain and stop them before they unleash the recipe on the world.  The voices of Miranda Cosgrove, Dana Gaaier, Elsie Fisher, Ken Jeong, Russell Brand, and Benjamin Bratt also star in supporting roles.To be honest, I found Despicable Me to be so light-heartedly entertaining and enjoyable that's it's easily at the top of my animated feature list (just so you know that I'm being biased here).  With that being said, Despicable Me 2 has been one of my must-see movies all summer long...and it didn't disappoint me one bit.  As an easy target for slap-stick comedy (and I'll give you one guess who my favorite comedy trio is), the Minions are good for wholesome unadulterated laughter.  As usual, their antics and gibberish talk will have you laughing to the limit - but only if you're interested in that sort of thing.  It's easy to imagine Despicable Me being everyone's favorite animated feature, or quite honestly the animated film you'll never want to see again.  Just because The Three Stooges brand of humor is my thing doesn't mean it's going to agree with everyone's style of humor.  In fact, it's pretty easy to imagine someone describing a film of this nature as being ""dumb"" or ""pointless.""  However, if that's how you felt about the first film, I couldn't disagree with you more.While the first film focused more on the girls and their quest to find a home to call their own (and a father to care for them), Despicable Me 2 focuses much more on the Minions.  In fact, at a short 90 minutes or so, it almost feels like the girls are absent from the film entirely.  Speaking of a reduced role, Russell Brand's character, Dr. Nefariou (although important to the film's climax) is also absent for the majority of the film.  However, that's not to say the film isn't without enjoyable characters.  Between the Minions and the plump villain in question, Eduardo Perez (originally voiced by Al Pacino, but changed to Benjamin Bratt just months before the film's release date), there's no shortage of memorable moments.  At the same time, there's love in the air throughout the film with the introduction of the ambitious Lucky Wilde, who (if you couldn't tell from the film's trailer) has a pretty memorable first meeting with Gru.There's not a whole lot to say about this film that wasn't said about the first film.  It's a family-friendly flick that absolutely anyone can enjoy.  The animation is sharp, colorful, and pristine.  Plus, the characters will have you giggling virtually nonstop.  While I'm admittedly not a huge Steve Carrell fan, it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role of Gru - so with that being said, this is the one exception where I would be writing someone a letter on Mr. Carrell's behalf if for some reason he was ever replaced.  Regardless, the characters are clearly catching on in popularity - especially the Minions who will be getting a movie of their own, called Minions (hitting theaters in December 2014).  And, as long as the plot is solid (which it is) and the Minions are funny (which they are), Illumination Entertainment can keep punching out as many Despicable Me films as they want.P.S. - Make sure to stay through the credits.  The Minions will be taking auditions for their new film next year.Grade:  B+FNDNreview.com ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(4503, 4517)",5,0.0,False

Visually it was excellent but the characters and the storyline is what will keep you hooked. The Characters are awesome. The acting was amazing. It was dramatic, emotional, and action-packed. The basic plot is about a hobbit (played oh so well by Elijah Wood) that acquires a ring of dark power and he has to destroy it. A lot unfolds along the way. THE LORD OF THE RINGS: FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is pure magic and the ending leaves you craving parts 2 and 3. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The acting was amazing,"(463, 485)",2,0.45,False

Does he play to stereotypes about the Japanese, send up the stereotypes, or do both at the same time? Probably both. However, he never drifts into falsehood. This is how Japanese people acted in the days of the samurai, and also in 1954. The bandits, the farmers, the samurai. Don't doubt it. With insights about how they act now, and in fact how all people think. Literature transcends time and place, folks, and literature is what this is. Damn entertaining, too.Second impression. I tend not to care about black and white versus color. Technology, that's all. But Kurosawa-san did such a remarkable job of using black and white in this case that to colorize it would be a crime. You may never hear me give a hoot again. But the contrasts are so visible, and so appropriate to the mood. Don't remake it, don't Ted Turnerize it, don't do anything to it except watch and enjoy. I betcha I could know exactly what was happening even without my glasses. Kurosawa is good, and I mean goooooooood.Third impression. His use of scenery. His use of music. His use of silence. His absolutely perfect eye for finding the right faces. We all know the stereotype, right? All Asians look alike. Not so in my classrooms, since I've lived here for over 5 years, but sometimes films can mess with me. Not this one! Distinctive faces, and all so damn expressive. So let's also shoot down the stereotype of inscrutability. These technical details grate on us when done wrongly, but perhaps we forget to laud those who get it right. This classic by young Kurosawa most definitely ""got it right.""Blurred impressions after that.Our director/screenwriter has a real knack for dialogue that you just want to quote. Grab the person (or cat) beside you and say, ""Did you hear that?"" Then you repeat it and come across as an idiot. But hey, it's like that. In translation, even. What's it like in the original? It's like what we like.Plot summary. 30 or 40 bandits terrorize a poor farming village, same as they did many such villages back in those days, but this one manages to hire seven samurai. ""Will work for rice"" or something like that. The interaction and individuality among these guys sets the standard against which all such movies must be judged. I either haven't seen or can't remember the movies in your minds. Unforgiven, Three Amigos, Three (really four) Musketeers, Magnificent Seven, Dirty Dozen, Eight Million Morons. It doesn't matter. SEVEN SAMURAI is the gold standard, folks.It's very easy, and lazy, to fall into the old trap of hiring mercenaries and letting them do the rest. It's also false. Our farmers happen to be human beings as well. We have training, teamwork, misunderstandings, conflict, thinking and planning by both saviors and saved, and compromise. Also, I must forcibly interject, realism. Would you really give the heroes your rice and not your opinions on how to save your posterior? I think not.Kurosawa has the amazing ability to switch from comic to dramatic so fast that it's like a punch in the gut. He also shows welcome restraint in not doing so for the first hour or so. You don't expect it. No, you don't. That increases the impact. It's called understatement, folks. A rare and wondrous gift. As are wit, humor, and irony so sharp it almost draws blood.The subplots add to the whole, making it greater than the sum of its parts. Some thoughts on war which ring quite true, not injected as sermonizing but integral to characterization. A wee bit of comic relief injected precisely where we need it and to remarkable effect. An author who never forgets that his first priority is to entertain us, the readers. Um, viewers. Sorry. He blurs the line between filmmaker and novelist. You can't know how much I wish more filmmakers would do that.In other words, and this ain't no surprise, I highly recommend this film. And, at over 3 hours, it's good value.

But hey, isn't that what Christmas is for? :)However, I was enthralled by the story of how the musical came to be. We get not only plenty of airtime from Lord Webber and Stilgoe & Hart, but we see the original stars in footage that we would never be able to see otherwise. Sara Brightman singing ""Pie Jesu"" in what looks to be a cathedral, Michael Crawford doing light comedy--light comedy!--on a British show and performing in the circus. We're taken into Webber's estate to view the singers who first performed the Phantom material as it was being constructed, and are enlightened as to how Britain charmingly previewed the musical, via music video, to the rest of the nation as what looked to be, quite literally, a rock opera. (Well, it WAS the 80s.)The other extras that focus on the movie production are also quite good. I thought it might be only a slightly longer version of one of those HBO First Looks, but it was super-informative. In it you get a look at the premier, at part of Emmy Rossum's screen test, the fun of trying to understand Jennifer Ellison's (Meg) accent, Patrick Wilson singing opera in sport pants, the Mask of the Red Death swigging from a water bottle, plus a look at the outrageously elaborate costumes and what the chandelier falling looked like in real life. There's so much more I can't remember, but trust me, it's worth it.I'm not sure sure about the additional scene. I'm glad they didn't keep it in. While it's a lovely song, the Phantom was too soft, not at all obsessive or dangerous. And we don't want that, now, do we?And, about that movie. Emmy Rossum has a perfectly capable voice even at her age, just as Christine is supposed to be quite young. But her face had the same expression on it--trancelike--almost the entire time. When she saw Raoul caught in the Punjab lasso and cried out, I was like, Finally! And then she went back into the trance. I wish they had coaxed more expression out of her.Gerard Butler. Either you love him or you hate him. We all know he's hot. I was really surprised at first sight of the Phantom, because from the stage shows you get the impression that even with the mask on, he's a crowish figure of no less than forty years. I enjoy watching Butler, but if they had used someone less attractive I don't think it would have taken anything away from the movie. As for his voice--I whispered to my mom at one point that he sounds like a rock star. And yes, Butler was indeed in a rock band. He's no Michael Crawford. And sometimes his treatment of phrases isn't the best. But on the flip side, sometimes it's just as uncomfortable listening to a stage Phantom sing in full-on operatic mode. It's...whatever you like, I guess.Of course, the sets are lavish and the costumes lush (and vice versa). I love Minnie Driver in the Carlotta role, and the men who played the managers were really a delight. I know people gripe about all these different things--the addition of scenes, speaking dialogue that was previously sung, the misplacement of the chandelier's big scene, a colorful masquerade being clothed in black and white. But in the end I still think the movie is more than worth it. Why?Because you can see it whenever you want to now. Because the full orchestra sounds heaven-sent. Because knowing all the words to a musical is a big deal. Because it's beautiful. Because it's a full-on experience that requires nothing less than your full attention. Because snow and confetti falling never looked so perfect. Because my first exposure to the musical was on a cassette tape with half the second act missing and it was still so potent that I stayed up to listen to it again. Because the Phantom's hot (oops).So, that's what I think. If you truly love the musical, you'll like the movie. If you knew nothing of the musical before, then you'll probably like it, too.

There are happy moments, very sad moments (thus the tissues!), lots of drama both as Policemen in uniform and at home with their families.

A VERY funny scene where Harvey is working on the garage when the guys are out for lunch and Shane reveals that his friend Harvey is in the hospital! Same name - different Harvey, another funny scene that goes into the saddest scene of the film.

Personally,that's one of my favorite scenes! Many poignant family moments combined with police on the job action and a main storyline woven in as smoothly as silk with a message so powerful about fathers and family that your own life may be changed in that area. Many scenes in this movie softens hearts and for me anyway, gave me the desire to be the best woman/Christian/wife/mother I can possibly be. I've seen amazing changes in my husband, and that's seldom seen just from seeing a movie but - the message of being the BEST father and husband that leads his home by the Word of God Courageous is SO very powerful and makes you feel every emotion you possibly feel. Whether Christian or not, I HIGHLY recommend Courageous. My husband and I watch our copy at least twice a week, it's THAT good. Best news is, it has so many powerful scenes that while watching with several non-Christians, two gave their lives to Christ after seeing it with us! Whether a couple in their 50s with children and grandchildren like us, or a Church group - young or old, I just cannot recommend Couragous more! I PRAY that the Kendrick brothers actually read these reviews, as we would LOVE to see MANY MORE movies written/made by them. Lots of talent, both in storylines and in acting. Actors & actresses chosen completely fit the parts and this also is the same with their other films: their first, Flywheel, also Facing the Giants (watching as I type this!) and Fireproof. ALL wonderful in their own ways. We HAD to own them all! You'll NOT be sorry viewing and purchasing this gem, whether Christian or non. Thank you, Kendrick brothers, for wonderful family entertainment - Christian or non -Courageouswith a message that touches hearts and leaves us craving much more!  A MUST SEE! For us, 5 stars isn't enough, it's THAT good! Many fathers, especially Christian fathers, will have a difficult time remaining seated in the final scene, when Adam is speaking at church about dads and their being Godly and Courageous dads, husbands, and men during the call for such dads who are among those the most courageous for God and family.By the way -- ALL the actors are members of a Sherwood Church in Albany,Georgia. I think that's AMAZING!

But seeing as the studio gave Bryan Singer all the money in the world, plenty of time, and quite a bit of creative control and artistic license (I cannot imagine that DC comics was eager to have Superman portrayed as a deadbeat dad!), there should be more than just a few good moments.  Here are the main problems, in no particular order:1) Brandon Routh is not a good Superman.  When he is Clark Kent, he mostly closely resembles Max Fisher from `Rushmore.'  But Max Fisher would have been a better actor.  The worst thing is, and I don't know this was Routh's idea or Singer's, but he does a note-for-note impersonation of Christopher Reeves.  IMO this is just plain ghoulish, considering that the beloved Reeves died just 2 years before this movie.  The various James Bond actors have all played the character with at least slight differences.  Each actor playing Superman has, up to this point, played the character very differently: Kirk Allyn, George Reeves, Christopher Reeve, and Dean Caine each brought a different interpretation of the character.  Why in heaven's name Singer had Routh simply ape Reeves is beyond all comprehension, unless Routh is simply so horrible an actor that he could not be allowed to make the role his own.  On the plus side, Brandon Routh has caused me to give greater respect to Kirk Allyn, and to put George Reeves and Christopher Reeve upon even higher pedestals.2) Kate Bosworth is simply the weakest, blandest, most boring Lois Lane ever.  Not only is there no chemistry with Routh, she has no chemistry with anyone.  She appears simply to have been cast for physical attractiveness and demographic appeal.  But on the upside, she enhances my already great appreciation of Noel Niell, Phyllis Coates, and Margot Kidder.3) Kevin Spacey is usually a good actor, and I guess you could say he gives a good performance here, but ultimately I think he is not quite what Lex Luthor should be.  But maybe if he'd had a decent script.  I don't object to Luthor being played as a closeted gay, Lyle Talbot played Luthor that way in the 1950 movie serial.  But ultimately Spacey is a little camp in the role, even more camp than Gene Hackman in 1978.4) Ultimately, the script is bad.  [SPOILER ALERT:] As much as it must have simply reeked with dramatic temptations, the idea that shortly after bedding Lois, Superman would just fly off into space for 5 years is absurd and offensive.  The real Superman, being raised on Kansas farm, would have too much Midwestern sexual guilt to permit him to just desert Lois for 5 years while she incubates his baby and marries someone else.  This is creepy.  Also, there is a scene in which Superman uses his X-ray vision to spy at Lois, her husband and baby in their home.  I'm sorry, but Superman should not be a Superstalker.5) Speaking of the script, there is a lack of internal logic regarding kryptonite.  [SPOILER ALERT:] Supposedly the kryptonite in Luthor's artificial island makes Superman as weak as drugged kitten.  Yet 15 minutes later, Superman is supposedly able to lift the whole daggum island up and carry it into outer space.6) There is the reuse of Marlon Brando's voice and John Williams' musical score from the 1978 Superman movie.  While these things were good in the original context, in this film they, along with his star's attempt to channel Christopher Reeve serve to create the impression that Bryan Singer really has nothing new to add to the Superman mythos, that he is flailing blindly here, creating sound and fury, but signifying nothing.And that is the thing.  Nothing that is new in this film is any good, and all the good things were already done in various, earlier celluloid incarnations.  And so, the upside is that this DVD has sent me happily back the `Adventures of Superman' TV show.  You are far better off viewing those concise and charming episodes than in owning this pretentious piece of grave robbery. ANSWERNOTFOUND",few good moments,"(351, 367)",1,0.35000000000000003,False

The various James Bond actors have all played the character with at least slight differences.  Each actor playing Superman has, up to this point, played the character very differently: Kirk Allyn, George Reeves, Christopher Reeve, and Dean Caine each brought a different interpretation of the character.  Why in heaven's name Singer had Routh simply ape Reeves is beyond all comprehension, unless Routh is simply so horrible an actor that he could not be allowed to make the role his own.  On the plus side, Brandon Routh has caused me to give greater respect to Kirk Allyn, and to put George Reeves and Christopher Reeve upon even higher pedestals.2) Kate Bosworth is simply the weakest, blandest, most boring Lois Lane ever.  Not only is there no chemistry with Routh, she has no chemistry with anyone.  She appears simply to have been cast for physical attractiveness and demographic appeal.  But on the upside, she enhances my already great appreciation of Noel Niell, Phyllis Coates, and Margot Kidder.3) Kevin Spacey is usually a good actor, and I guess you could say he gives a good performance here, but ultimately I think he is not quite what Lex Luthor should be.  But maybe if he'd had a decent script.  I don't object to Luthor being played as a closeted gay, Lyle Talbot played Luthor that way in the 1950 movie serial.  But ultimately Spacey is a little camp in the role, even more camp than Gene Hackman in 1978.4) Ultimately, the script is bad.  [SPOILER ALERT:] As much as it must have simply reeked with dramatic temptations, the idea that shortly after bedding Lois, Superman would just fly off into space for 5 years is absurd and offensive.  The real Superman, being raised on Kansas farm, would have too much Midwestern sexual guilt to permit him to just desert Lois for 5 years while she incubates his baby and marries someone else.  This is creepy.  Also, there is a scene in which Superman uses his X-ray vision to spy at Lois, her husband and baby in their home.  I'm sorry, but Superman should not be a Superstalker.5) Speaking of the script, there is a lack of internal logic regarding kryptonite.  [SPOILER ALERT:] Supposedly the kryptonite in Luthor's artificial island makes Superman as weak as drugged kitten.  Yet 15 minutes later, Superman is supposedly able to lift the whole daggum island up and carry it into outer space.6) There is the reuse of Marlon Brando's voice and John Williams' musical score from the 1978 Superman movie.  While these things were good in the original context, in this film they, along with his star's attempt to channel Christopher Reeve serve to create the impression that Bryan Singer really has nothing new to add to the Superman mythos, that he is flailing blindly here, creating sound and fury, but signifying nothing.And that is the thing.  Nothing that is new in this film is any good, and all the good things were already done in various, earlier celluloid incarnations.  And so, the upside is that this DVD has sent me happily back the `Adventures of Superman' TV show.  You are far better off viewing those concise and charming episodes than in owning this pretentious piece of grave robbery. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(4002, 4016)",1,0.0,False

Leading up to the air date of the first episode of season 6, there was a ton of press coverage, promotional trailers, posters, teaser, etc. The hype was nonstop, and the fans were salivating more than ever. Expectations were ridiculously high--much higher than they ever were for the previous 5 seasons. Season 5 left us fans with many mysteries to ponder upon, and Abrams and Lindelof promised that questions would be answered.Were there any answers?I'm going to disagree with a good portion of the reviewers here and say: Yes, yes they were. Season 6 provided a lot more closure than many fans are willing to admit.I'm sure a good portion of fans who are reading this review (if any at all) are already moaning, groaning and rolling their eyes, but I ask those fans to consider something: Season 6 gave an answer to the smoke monster, the man in black, the nature of Jacob, the ""reason"" that they were all there (c'mon, that's been argued over since Season 1), the whispers, Richard Alpert's story, the effects of the incident, the sickness that consumed Danielle's crew, the overall point of the island, the wheel that Ben used, the source of the electromagnetism and what it does, the statue of Tarawet and how most of it got destroyed, the Black Rock, the origin of the others and their reason for being there, and the temple that's been talked about since the Season 3 finale. I'm not pulling these out of thin air, either. Re-watch the season. For that matter, re-watch the whole show, and then tell me that this season didn't resolve any plot threads. And let's not forget what the previous season have answered, which is much more than fans are, once again, willing to admit. Re-watching the series from the beginning has helped me realize that there really wasn't a whole lot to clear up after the show was finished, though I admit that a few plot threads were left hanging.It makes me sad to see this season criticized for not fulfilling any promises, when in fact it did, but it requires memory of everything else the series has answered, as well has subtly answered. 6 was hyped up so much that many fans (including myself) put it on some unreachable pedestal, one that no TV show could ever compare to. That's just what happens in a case like this, and it's almost inevitable. Even Abrams and Lindelof seemed to be getting rather defensive when the backlash erupted.But forget all of that for now. Let's just focus on the show. As always, there are many powerful performances by all of the lead actors. Terry O'Quinn does an outstanding, sinister performance as the man in black that has taken on the form of the deceased John Locke. The story arc of Matthew Fox's character, Jack Shephard, finally comes full circle with realizing his true destiny and rethinking everything he's done on the island. Ben (Michael Emerson) is as deceitful and evil as ever, but even he makes some highly noticeable changes midway through the season. Hurley's ability to talk to dead people is more important than ever, Richard's faith in Jacob is taken to its limits, and the entire LOST team is, once again, divided up. As usual, the show is very entertaining with spectacular performances, plot twists, drama, and none of the characters' dialogue or actions seem out of place. I'll actually admit that I felt underwhelmed at times, but thinking through everything I saw, as well as refreshing my memory on the show, has helped me to not only appreciate the season, but to love it as I love the ones that came before it.However, I can't give this season the full 5 stars. Sadly, it wasn't perfect, and despite my enjoyment, there were certainly things that could have been done better. The biggest problem with Season 6 is its pacing. Too much time was spent within the temple, and much of the time in this Egyptian maze dragged its feet, sometimes unsure of where it was going. Shoving the Dogen character down our throats and expecting us to care about him felt rather forced and unnatural. Once he was killed, it was stated  that he was the only thing keeping MIB out of the temple. Why is that? I felt they could have spent even a tad of those episodes explaining the reason for this. Surely it had something to do with Jacob assigning him the role, but it was mishandled. Watching the man in black go postal on that place was certainly a Godsend for many fans, myself included. Another portion of the show was spent on the beach just preparing for things to come, as opposed to anyone actually doing anything. It felt tired and, dare I say it, uninspired. It didn't seem smart for the show to be doing this on what is supposed to be the resolution to everything. Lastly, there is the flash-sideways timeline, or ""alternate reality,"" as many fans called it. The true nature of this story line isn't understood until the very last few minutes of the finale. After much thinking and processing, it certainly helps make this side of the story a lot more enjoyable and even relevant (much more relevant than many fans say it is), it doesn't help the previous episodes that they waited entirely too long to explain it. And the two ""realities"" don't even begin to connect until the 11th episode, with only 6 more to go. It was difficult for many fans to grasp the point and relevance of this reality, though I don't mean to suggest that too many fans simply have low intellects. The MIB and Jacob-centric episode ""Across the Sea"" was not as epic and incredible as it could have and certainly had the right to have been. Some parts felt anticlimactic. However, I'm on the side of fans that really liked this episode, and it gave closure to a lot more things than most fans say it did (are you noticing a trend here?).I'll stop with the criticisms because I feel I'm representing my opinion as being a lot more negative than it actually is (it's actually quite positive). Season 6 was very well done, despite a few shortcomings. The episode that I have to give special note to is the finale, otherwise known as ""The End."" What can I say? I laughed, I cried, I cheered, I watched in awe, and my heart was warmed more than it ever had been by the show. The ""light"" that the protector of the island is meant to protect seems to be a highly symbolic sort of plot device. I'll admit that I'm still trying to figure it out, but it certainly helps answer what the role of Jacob was, and what the role of anyone who is assigned the protector is. I can say without a doubt that the ""alternate reality"" is certainly connected to this light, and part of why it is so necessary to keep it safe. Some fans saw this as a cop-out, along with the AR, but I argue that it fits in with the show as well as everything else we've seen, if you give it a little thought.Out of all the answers that fans deny that Season 6 gave, no fan can argue that it gave a successful conclusion to each characters' story arc. Watching them evolve over so many episodes has been highly rewarding, and watching them find redemption is easily one of the best and most beautiful scenes of the entire show. I don't feel cheated whatsoever by the ending, and I don't think I would have it end any other way. I applaud the writers and producers for taking such a big risk for the end of their money maker. A new storytelling device and theme is given to each season, and season 6 was no different. It was risky, and they probably knew that some fans would be disappointed, but they created an extremely rewarding experience for this fan and many others. If you're a fan that's been following the show, you owe it to yourself to give this final piece of the puzzle a chance to fit in with the others.

Terrible acting? Got it. Terrible directing? Gotcha. No intelligence, heart, emotion, or, well...anything else aside from CGI? Done. Lucas has really outdone himself with this film; it may even be worse than ""The Matrix Reloaded"" and comes darn close to matching ""Terminator 3"" for worst prequel/sequel ever made. The power of hype in our society is truly astounding; despite the fact that not even a labotomized twelve-year old (for whom, according to Lucas's pathetic excuse, the picture is designed (minus the labotomy, of course)) could keep their eyes open long enough to witness this spasm-inducing lethargy, it made nearly $300 mill. at the box office. Of course, the power of hype made the original ""Star Wars"" the biggest success of all time (inflation-adjusted, it's nearly double ""Titanic""), despite the fact that that movie really isn't all that amazing either (that's another story...).The problem with ""Clones,"" and ""Menace"" and ""Sith,"" (and even the original ""Star Wars"") is George Lucas.

Terrible acting? Got it. Terrible directing? Gotcha. No intelligence, heart, emotion, or, well...anything else aside from CGI? Done. Lucas has really outdone himself with this film; it may even be worse than ""The Matrix Reloaded"" and comes darn close to matching ""Terminator 3"" for worst prequel/sequel ever made. The power of hype in our society is truly astounding; despite the fact that not even a labotomized twelve-year old (for whom, according to Lucas's pathetic excuse, the picture is designed (minus the labotomy, of course)) could keep their eyes open long enough to witness this spasm-inducing lethargy, it made nearly $300 mill. at the box office. Of course, the power of hype made the original ""Star Wars"" the biggest success of all time (inflation-adjusted, it's nearly double ""Titanic""), despite the fact that that movie really isn't all that amazing either (that's another story...).The problem with ""Clones,"" and ""Menace"" and ""Sith,"" (and even the original ""Star Wars"") is George Lucas.

The acting was good and all players did their jobs well but I was a bit put off by the smirking 'we're so smart and hip attitude' of the movie. A bit of humbleness is appealing you know. Some say the subject matter in this film i.e. to smoke or not to smoke is equally weighed. I personally didn't feel that way at all. I felt the overall tone for the movie was geared toward smoking. Personally, I don't smoke but I don't mind that this film is for smoking. What I liked about the film is that it kept my brain going. And like I said majority of this film is predictable, but you do begin to question how free the rights of the American Public are? Should smoking be banned or should smokers have their rights too? Like stated in the film people know smoking is bad yet they still do it. Why? The movie puts a nice spin on the importance of information and looking at things from alternative views.It's nice to see Aaron Eckhart play a good solid role for once. I think his performance in this film was excellent and extremely believable. I think after this role we will be seeing him in more movies. William H. Macy also stars and shines yet again. Macy is one of the best actors in Hollywood who for years still never got the appreciation he deserves. Also Katie Holmes does a decent job although her character is extremely predictable. I personally think Holmes does a good job at playing bad girl roles like her role here and in ""The Gift"". The reason I think that is because she looks so innocent so when she comes out saying something like ""I want to f*** you, when I watch you on TV"" it seems out of the ordinary for her. This is also probably another reason why Tom Cruise loves her; she's probably a very bad girl outside the public eye.Even though this is Jason Reitman's first feature film he is one to keep an eye on. I feel as the time goes on he will become a very big director just like his father. Being that ""Smoking"" is his first film, I think he has already hit a home run. I think the guy has talent and as long as he keeps making good movies he will be just as big as his dad is someday.I like the message behind ""Thank You For Smoking"" but not the overall subject matter of the film. This movie provides its audience with fine acting, a good script and some nice directing. The film's idea also keeps its audience thinking. It's a good movie to watch with someone and then have a nice long talk with about it afterwards. It's a satirical look at the smoking issue although I still feel it tilts more towards one side than the other.

They blockade the backwater world of Naboo, threatening an all-out war if their demands aren't met.  Why the Federation has taken that strategy is a mystery to the ruling government - the Senate of the Intergalactic Republic.  Because the galaxy is largely at peace (except for pockets of lawlessness) there is no standing army.  Instead, the Republic relies on the Jedi Knights - warriors schooled in the power of The Force - to maintain peace.  When Jedi Knights Qui-Gon (Liam Neeson) and Obi-Wan (Ewan McGregor) find themselves unable to forestall a war, they rescue Naboo's elected ruler Queen Amidala (Portman) from certain capture.  Having escaped the Federation, Amidala's damaged ship is forced to make emergency repairs on an even more remote planet - Tatooine.  Needing parts to fix their ship, and with nobody willing to accept their Republic Credits (even when prodded by Jedi mind tricks), Qui Gonn and Padme (one of the queen's loyal handmaidens) enlist the help of a local slave named Anakin.  He's just a kid, but even Qui-Gonn can tell that the boy has the power of the force flowing through him.  Soon the quest to repair the ship and escape to the Capitol of the Republic includes a mission to save Anakin as well, determine the nature of the Force energy coursing through him and to evaluate him for entry into the Jedi.This flick was a letdown in many ways, but it does have some qualities that survive repeat viewings.  Visually, it is spectacular - the final dogfight between the Federation and the Naboo was not topped or even equaled in ""Clones"".  Both films have epic battles involving computer-animated combatants, but the Gungans have more character than the clone army (though I wouldn't want to face-off either side, ridiculous characters are better than none at all, and the clones are utterly lacking in that area).  The story is simple - though the more complex plot of ""Clones"", with its many continuity lapses and gaps reveal that its makers have a narrative problem which is best served by keepings things simple.  Both films are marked by an epic Jedi duel, though the one in ""Clones"" was strikingly unspectacular.  Christopher Lee as Dooku also demonstrated that he can function quite well as an all-around lord of Evil in ""The Lord of the Rings"", but the script gives him little to do, and the story can't make up its mind as to whether we're supposed to think he might be good, or banish any idea that he's not utterly evil.  In contrast, Ray Park as Darth Maul is utterly drenched in evil, his face and body language communicating a very palpable sense of the Sith - the force of evil Jedi ready to tear the galactic order to shreds.  Maul's battle royale - alone against Qui-Gonn and Obi-Wan easily rivals that between Vader and Luke from ""Return of the Jedi"" in its narrative coherency, and is only clearly topped in that respect by Luke and Vader's duel from ""Empire"".

Christopher Nolan brings new life to the Caped Crusader, along with a more in-depth and believable psychology than anything seen previously. Nolan brings with him the psychological sophistication of his work in ""Memento,"" and it shows: he tells a real story with skill and elegance. Yes, ""Batman Begins"" has all the elements of traditional action flicks: car-chases, fight sequences, even the now-obligatory martial-arts training duels, but it also gives us reasons that are, if not logical, at least plausible why a billionaire orphan would dress up as a nocturnal rodent and fight crime on the streets, instead of, say, joining the Peace Corps. As in ""Memento,"" the plot really is not essential to the story, but plots are always the same in superhero flicks anyway: Hero discovers an enemy intent on destroying the world; Hero saves World and Girl. The plot in this is similar (though Batman has a bumper crop of villains to fight rather than just one) but it is not detrimental to the film: this is a tale of ideas and motivations first, and is more than the sum of its parts.I can't think of anyone I'd prefer as Batman than Christian Bale: he is good-looking, but with a certain ferocity to him that works for Batman, who is here more than slightly reminiscent of another of Bale's characters with a remarkably similar name. Batman's clearly a ""superhero,"" but unlike previous outings it is also impossible to forget this time that he is ultimately a Man, motivated not so much by an overpowering desire to do right as to inflict serious damage on people who do wrong. There's a substantial difference.Bale is in prime form here, as usual, but he's got quite a supporting cast to back him up. Liam Neeson is elegant as always in what appears to be a patented mentor role, but it was a refreshing change of pace to find him driven by darker motivations than usual. Michael Caine brings a humanity to Alfred, making him a father figure to Bruce and becoming more than just the crusty facilitator we're used to. Morgan Freeman's ""Q""-equivalent Lucius Fox is slightly redundant, as the third father-figure in the film, but he also brings a kindly cunning to his role that is fun to watch; he has been around long enough that he knows Wayne doesn't want gear for extreme sports, but he is also wise enough to ask no questions. The biggest surprise is perhaps Gary Oldman, who does a 180 from his usual slightly insane roles and embodies so much decent normalcy that it is slightly disconcerting in the midst of such madness. Indeed, the only weak spot in the casting is Katie Holmes as the dewy Rachel Dawes: she is amiable enough, but her smarmy debate-club delivery doesn't belong in the noir Gotham Nolan has given us; she's too young and too bathetic, and is sorely outclassed in an otherwise exceptionally outstanding ensemble.The production design is also outstanding. Gotham City is rotten to the core, to be sure, but there are observable vestiges of the grandeur that was, and also of the Wayne family ties to the city: Wayne Tower dominates the city centre, and the Wayne monorail - the pet project of Bruce's philanthropist father - is a now-dilapidated relic of better days. Batman's technology is not as advanced as we are used to from previous films, but this I see as an improvement rather than not. The Batmobile, for instance, resembles an unlovely cross between a Lamborghini and a Hummer - far tougher and less sleek than the others, but practical for the demands of city-saving. When it smashes into things and stays intact, I believe it's possible. I particularly like how it enters and exits the Batcave, without the luxury of lifts or hydraulics; it shoots, jet-propelled, through a waterfall into the Batcave, which is precisely that: a dark, dank, craggy mess home to some tens of thousands of bats. The Batsuit is something that looks like it might actually be an extant but neglected military prototype. And, thank God, it is presented sans the weird molded nipples. The evolution of it, particularly the Cowl, is also entertaining to watch. All this combines to give this Batman a far more realistic tone, something the franchise has long needed.But now let us return to Bruce Wayne for a moment. This is by far Christian Bale's most commercial film to date (ignoring 2002's forgettable ""Reign of Fire""), but the actor gives no sign that he knows he's a bona fide Hunky Movie Star heading a bona fide Big-Budget Summer Blockbuster, turning in a pitch-perfectly crafted performance that threatens to make him the Definitive Batman. Bale is as good at low-key performances as he is at outlandish ones, and here he strikes a remarkable balance; his Bruce Wayne is subtle, nuanced, tormented not only by the demons of his childhood traumas but what he perceives as his continued failure to avenge them. He is extensively trained, exceedingly dedicated, but not entirely grounded; there are hints of madness in his dark eyes. Bale is debonair and suave, yes; he is completely believable as his shallow playboy persona.And yet even his handsome playboy is ominously rough around the edges. Bale already has experience playing spoiled, psychotic rich kids, and there are moments when Bruce Wayne says something and his voice slips into that unnervingly hollow sing-song fans of ""American Psycho"" remember, his vapid grin gets a little too wide and too feral, and his eyes get a familiar twinkle to them that is far from comfortable. He has a way of cocking his head, even without the bat-eared cowl, that is distinctly predatory. Bale makes Bruce Wayne something he hasn't been before: scary. One would not want to meet him in a dark alleyway, nor would one want to get on his bad side. He is a superhero who all too easily could really enjoy his work, and we know it.Bale has always had a knack for using his physicality to enhance his characters: in ""Empire of the Sun"" he went from a skipping slip of a lad to a feral survivor; in ""American Psycho,"" he was a ripped, six-pack-bearing, image-obsessed narcissist; in ""The Machinist"" he transformed into a walking skeleton, haunted nearly to his own extinction by his inner demons. Here he looks the part again: at 6'2"", he is already the tallest of the actors to play Batman, but he is definitely the largest too, equipped with a brawny physique that looks quite capable of beating the life out of someone. It is more than eye-candy here (although I'll admit I'm happy to see him buff and beautiful again after his cadaverous turn in ""The Machinist""): it makes the superhero credible when we know there is under the molded latex six-pack of the Batsuit a real, honed, physical weapon that could inflict definite and serious damage.One is also impressed upon in this film that Bruce's alter-ego Batman is more than a way to shoot off steam after the playboy's partying. Unlike Peter Parker, who strives to live a normal life despite his superhero responsibilities as Spider-Man, Bruce Wayne needs Batman: the two are symbiotic halves of the same whole, neither equaling a whole person and neither capable of existing without the other.This is definitely a Batman of the twenty-first century, informed by terrorism and 9/11. Rather than outlandish corporate villains and hedonistic monstrosities, the enemies here are idealists, warriors who fight for ideas rather than power. Ra's al-Ghul and his inscrutable League of Shadows operate covertly, infiltrating hierarchies, sabotaging economies. Here, they employ a biotoxin emptied into the water supply as a weapon; their aim is not to destroy the world, but to ""save it from itself."" And not only the bad guys have been modernized; much of the Bat-gear is acquired from mothballed military projects, which all too frequently were rejected, we're told, because the government didn't feel that saving soldiers' lives were worth the expense.All this coalesces into not only a grown-up superhero flick but a grown-up film, period. The film has received some criticism for not playing up to the younger, more comic-book atmosphere of the others, but this is precisely one of its biggest strengths. It is concerned with adult burdens and adult methods. This Batman is part film noir and part action flick, but the two are married gracefully, without insulting the viewer's intelligence, bringing a long-overdue elegance to the franchise and offering the promise of several more fine outings to come.

This match deserved the BORING chants it got from the crowd and I gave it 2 only because of Austin's stunner on Lesnar.Scotty 2 Hotty & Rikishi VS the Basham Brothers VS APA VS the Self-Proclaimed World's Greatest Tag Team (WWE Tag Team Championship) - 6/10I didn't like the idea of two 4 way tag team matches in one night and this one was disappointing. The first one was way better and this had no good moments. Just an average smackdown match.Victoria VS Molly Holly (Women's Championship) - 2.5/10Basically your average women's match, very boring.Eddie Guerrero VS Kurt Angle (WWE Championship) - 7.5/10This was pretty good match. Nothing amazing but still good.Undertaker VS Kane - 7/10To be honest I expected more out of the match, the match was pretty disappointing but undertaker's return was one of the best moments of the night. The atmosphere in the crowd was great and I gave this 7 because of his return.Chris Benoit VS Triple H VS Shawn Michaels (World Heavyweight Championship) - 9.5/10Like the rock and sock match, this match lived up to its hype. Definitely felt like a wrestlemania main event. Thank god there was another great match in this poor wrestlemania.SCORE: 75/120 (62.5/100)According to the key I have rated wrestlemania as 'Good', a satisfying PPV and you could perhaps buy this if you really feel you want it. This is accurate. Nothing amazing from wrestlemania. I expected so much more. Don't bother buying this unless you just want to see it because it is the 20th anniversary.

A good performance from RVD.Christian VS Chris Jericho - 7/10This match was a bit disappointing, kind of a match you would see on television not wrestlemania.

It's hard to watch this and not see the similarities and also knowing that Battle Royale came out 10 years before this movie or book was even thought of. I didn't exactly buy into the hype of this movie because of so and actually took my time before deciding to sit down and watch it for the first time. This movie I think was just a bunch of hype the same as Black Swan and all those others than pop up out of no where and all of a sudden seem to capture the attention of the box office. Maybe it's one of those pictures where the book is different and much better but as a movie this one feels overly long and quite boring in a lot of parts. If you've seen Battle Royale or have not, you should definitely watch it. It goes into detail about the things this movie skimps over and explores the characters on a much deeper level. Watching The hunger games I felt I was watching almost like a B-movie rip off of Battle Royale, or how can I put it... it's a lot more toned down and that's which kills the shock value of the story. I think this is one of those movies you only enjoy if you've read the book and get to see it come alive. As for me it just didn't cut it especially since I've seen this done before only better with a much better plot. I'm sure there's die hard fanatics for ""The hunger games"" but if you've never seen ""Battle Royale"" than you really are just praising a false idol.What makes this movie even more painstaking to watch is that it is long and not very engaging. I found myself pausing the video and running off to do other tasks, and then coming back to it. The movie just seemed to go on and on and on dragging out scenes forever and then having the nerve to give you one of those open endings. This movie is over 2 hours long and the story hardly has any real dialogue to it. You'll find yourself more mesmerized by trying to figure out the ridiculous fashions of this futuristic world. To me that was the more interesting part to watch especially the awkwardly shaped beard of one of the head figure characters. What also struck me was the character Rue and the uproar about the casting for that character. I couldn't believe how nasty people were over the casting of a cute little girl to play her character that basically only had a couple of lines to say. I mean I think if you blinked you'd miss her role in this movie. It really goes to show just how petty certain people can be over absolutely nothing (probably some of these people randomly down voting reviews). Especially in the case of a movie where the race of characters was never described. The biggest surprise was seeing Lenny Kravitz in the film. I didn't even know he was in to acting but his character was random enough so whatever.The one thing I think that really hurt this movie the most was the lack of explanation in the film. The state of the society is never really explained. Why there are 12 districts and all of them are basically low class working districts and the city is lush and rich is never explained. What the ""hunger"" part about the entire game/story is about. They only hint at a scene where the main character is starving in flash backs or surprised to get a piece of bread from a friend saying ""is this real"" but that's all you get. No explanation at all as to why these districts are basically laborers that provide necessities for the well to do but live in poverty themselves. Just from the hints and I mean very few hints in the movie the children fighting all come from these repressed low class labor societies where they are picked at random to fight in these games and chosen to be the victor (btw that plot is never explained you have to piece it together yourself throughout the entire movie). It looked like the participating districts were rewarded with food or something if I saw correctly in the riots (also unexplained) but whatever. This is just a bad movie for lots of reasons but mostly for not explaining things that should be explained like the background for the story at least. There is just a simple clip shown in the movie about a war and the games sort of being like the Olympics to show that courage and strength still exists (yeah, still very pointless).Here's where Battle Royale does everything so much better. The plot of a group of students being forcefully captured by the government and thrown into a Military war/social project called ""The Program"". The kids are handed weapons and supplies at random and told only one of them can survive and they have to kill all of their classmates if they want to make it home alive. The kids don't really understand what is going on (not even the bombs/tracking devices) around their neck. They at first are hesitant to participate in the game but when others start killing each other it suddenly becomes a game of instinct and survival. Some of the kids form social pacts to survive, some like to survive alone, and some just enjoy killing whomever they can find, and some just refuse to participate and try to find another way out. Battle Royale does the story better because its almost like a study of human survival. You get a chance to learn about the background on the characters and their relationship to the other characters which is what makes seeing one of them die or get killed more personal. You don't get to explore any other characters in The Hunger Games but the two main characters ""Bow girl"" and ""Guy who is useless"". There's also Rue who character depth includes ""These are Mocking Jays we use them to signal time in my district"" and that's about as much as you get. For a 2.5hr movie I find The Hunger Games to be extremely vague in a lot of areas it shouldn't be.So basically overall... if you want to see a GOOD movie about Young adults being forced to kill other young adults watch Battle Royale.

Both films have a complexity which is lacking in most popular movies.If you go back to 2000 and take a look at Memento, you can see that Nolan has always believed that his audience was capable of figuring things out. One of his most complex films is The Prestige and I had to include it in this list. I've resisted the temptation to include multiple entries by one director for the most part, but Nolan is an exception because his films are so diverse. He's not using an established formula or focusing on one genre. In that respect, he's like a modern Stanley Kubrick.Cutter (Caine) explains that a magic trick consists of three parts: The pledge looks at something, the turn alters that thing and the prestige is the payoff. One example would be seeing a bird in a cage (the pledge), seeing it disappear (the turn), and finally seeing the magician produce it from his pocket (the prestige).The whole film plays out like a magic trick.The Prestige is a complex story, set in Victorian England, with one significant twist and a number of minor surprises. It deals with the story of two rival magicians, Robert Angier (Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Bale). Borden inadvertently ties a knot which results in the death of Angier's wife when she fails to escape from a tank of water. The ensuing rivalry lasts for the remainder of their lives.The two both enjoy periods of success, but are continually striving to find the ultimate trick. Both men become obsessed with success and each has a deep desire to outdo the other. We are shown other magicians and learn that success often comes at a high price. It may even result in the magician keeping secrets off the stage which limit his personal freedom.Eventually, Borden comes up with a trick that Angier can't figure out. It involves Borden entering a box on one side of the stage and emerging from a box on the other side of the stage moments later. He calls it The Transported Man.In an attempt to come up with something even better, Angier visits Nikola Tesla (Bowie) in Colorado. As you may know, Tesla was an inventor who experimented a great deal with electricity. Angier asks him to build a machine which might be used in his act. Unfortunately, science is not completely predictable. Tesla delivers, but Angier has to be willing to pay a high price that goes beyond money.I don't think I need to say any more about the plot. Bale's performance is superb and I think it's the best of his career. Jackman is also very convincing and the supporting cast is flawless. I'm always impressed by Rebecca Hall, but Bowie's cameo as Tesla was a revelation. Michael Caine holds the whole thing together and has important scenes at the beginning and end of the film.Although the running time is in excess of two hours, you'll barely notice. There's always something important happening on the screen. What elevates this film to the level of greatness is its replay value. The first time you see it, you'll miss the relevance of some of the dialogue. On repeat viewings, you'll see how clever the screenplay is. The big reveal is hinted at in the first 20 minutes of the film and you'll smile when you realize what you missed. Like Scorsese's Shutter Island, events have new meaning when you see them with full knowledge of the facts. It's clever stuff.

It doesn't bring anything new to horror and relies to much on cheap jump scares for my taste. Parts of the film are very atmospheric and scary. My favorite part is where Carolyn is awoken in the middle of the night and lured into the basement by disembodied clapping only to be attacked.

The film was quite predictable and wasn't surprising in any positive way.The film was surprising in a number of negative ways. First of all, the writers of the film, Chad and Carey Hayes, wrote this film as religious propaganda and it definitely shows. Faith is brought up in extremely obvious dialog multiple times and the entire film just boils down to a very simple good vs. evil story where faith triumphs over evil. The treatment of women is painfully apparent that the lens of the film is one of conservatism and religion. The evil spirit only directly attacks women. Women have been known in the Bible to be weaker then men and more susceptible to evil, causing original sin and things of that nature. On the night the evil starts, Carolyn initiates sex with her husband and we all know how well the Bible treats seductresses. This act basically ushers the evil in to her and of course the husband is merely an innocent bystander in the situation. Watching the misogyny on the screen was infuriating.The villain of the film is Bathsheba, an evil witch who sacrifices children to Satan. Even after her death, she has been possessing women and manipulating them into killing their children and/or themselves. It's fun to look at the biblical Bathsheba. King David spied her in her bath, fell in love with her, and seduced her. Then he tried to cover up his sin by ordering the death of her husband. I find it particularly ironic that this evil, child-murdering female is named after a woman who was objectified and victimized by a powerful man and probably raped.The last offensive thing about the film is the treatment of the Salem witch trials. The film puts forth that real witches were killed for the greater good. Not one little comment was made to say that innocent people died at all. Bathsheba could have committed suicide to save herself from a much more agonizing death being burned at the stake. I understand making history fit a story, but justifying the deaths of innocent people is pretty disgusting.The Conjuring is a misogynistic and offensive film.

It tells the story of four nations Air, water, fire,  and earth, each of which has inhabitants called benders that can control their nation's element. All nations lived in peace until the fire nation attacked in hopes of taking over. The  remedy for their defeat  is the person known as the avatar. The only being capable of mastering all four elements and burdened with the responsibility of keeping peace between the nations. If the Avatar dies he is reincarnated into a bender of the next element in the cycle and must journey the world to learn the other three.  This movie is a terrible rendition of the story.  The actors are terrible. This is a major understament for the character of prince Zuko.  within the cartoon he is forceful and demanding with a harsh and nilhistic demeanor. The prince Zuko in this film is pitiful not only in appearance, but in his acting. he blurts out lines like a child.The Avatar's name and those of his friends are  constantly mispronounced and this film strips away from Aang his playful and goofy side replacing it with a laughable form of stoic detachment. The bending is accomplished with overly dramatic yoga moves that in lieu of their quick performance in the cartoon are slow and look terrible. The film threw a whole bunch of special effects together  and melded them  with inexperienced actors and TERRIBLE dialogue. An example of which is see when aang talks to the earthbenders and says ""The ground is an extension of who you are!!!!"" If you're trying to encourage someone let alone a group of people, do you really think comparing them to the dirt under their feet is going to work? They're eathbenders, not dirt.Cartoon facts vs Movie lies:Avatars can marry and have children in the cartoon and they do. In this movie Aang constantly repeats that the monks told him he could never have a family. LIE!!!!Firebenders can make their own fire in the cartoon. In the movie firebenders could not do that. they could only use fire if they found some LIE!!!.The Avatar's name is pronounced ""ang""  as in the end of ""Bang"". In this movie they pronounce it ""ong""  LIE!!!!The episodes of the cartoon particularly the ones on which this is based feature several interesting spirits includeding the awesomest one called Koh the face stealer. The movie only has ang encounter the blue dragon spirit.

It tells the story of four nations Air, water, fire,  and earth, each of which has inhabitants called benders that can control their nation's element. All nations lived in peace until the fire nation attacked in hopes of taking over. The  remedy for their defeat  is the person known as the avatar. The only being capable of mastering all four elements and burdened with the responsibility of keeping peace between the nations. If the Avatar dies he is reincarnated into a bender of the next element in the cycle and must journey the world to learn the other three.  This movie is a terrible rendition of the story.  The actors are terrible. This is a major understament for the character of prince Zuko.  within the cartoon he is forceful and demanding with a harsh and nilhistic demeanor. The prince Zuko in this film is pitiful not only in appearance, but in his acting. he blurts out lines like a child.The Avatar's name and those of his friends are  constantly mispronounced and this film strips away from Aang his playful and goofy side replacing it with a laughable form of stoic detachment. The bending is accomplished with overly dramatic yoga moves that in lieu of their quick performance in the cartoon are slow and look terrible. The film threw a whole bunch of special effects together  and melded them  with inexperienced actors and TERRIBLE dialogue. An example of which is see when aang talks to the earthbenders and says ""The ground is an extension of who you are!!!!"" If you're trying to encourage someone let alone a group of people, do you really think comparing them to the dirt under their feet is going to work? They're eathbenders, not dirt.Cartoon facts vs Movie lies:Avatars can marry and have children in the cartoon and they do. In this movie Aang constantly repeats that the monks told him he could never have a family. LIE!!!!Firebenders can make their own fire in the cartoon. In the movie firebenders could not do that. they could only use fire if they found some LIE!!!.The Avatar's name is pronounced ""ang""  as in the end of ""Bang"". In this movie they pronounce it ""ong""  LIE!!!!The episodes of the cartoon particularly the ones on which this is based feature several interesting spirits includeding the awesomest one called Koh the face stealer. The movie only has ang encounter the blue dragon spirit.

The critics indicated that the story shows how Ophelia creates a fantasy world to escape the horrors around her.  However, most of the truly horrific scenes in the movie don't have Ophelia in them at all.  That made some of the violence simply gratuitous and distracting from the ""young girl creates her own fantasy world"" theme.  Also, the first two quests that are given to Ophelia by the faun don't really advance the main story in any way.  I felt the fantasy scenes were too disconnected from the rest of the story to be the central theme.If the central theme was intended to revolve around the horrors of war, then (aside from a different title and trailer) the movie needed to develop the backstory of the rebels--and perhaps even the captain-- better.  As it was, most of the violence centered around one ficticious captain, which again made the violence seem gratuitous.The movie was beautifully shot, and I found it to be well acted overall.

The flower, and its ability to restore youth, is discovered, used and kept secret by Mother Gothel. When the kingdom's beloved queen falls ill, a search for the flower (apparently its existence wasn't *completely* secret) is successfully undertaken and the healing potion brewed from it restores the queen's health. The flower's magical abilities are also transferred to the hair of the queen's unborn child, Rapunzel. When Mother Gothel discovers this and learns that the magical properties are only retained as long as the hair remains uncut, she kidnaps Rapunzel and raises her as her own child. Claiming that she wants to keep Rapunzel safe from a frightening world full of danger and thugs, Mother Gothel locks her away in a remote tower. While her hair (almost a character in and of itself) grows longer and longer, Rapunzel blossoms into a surprisingly well-adjusted young woman and gifted artist who longs to see the world - particularly the mysterious lights that appear in the night sky each year on her birthday.Enter our amusing narrator, Flynn Rider, a roguish thief who has just stolen a tiara and is on the run from palace guards when he comes across Rapunzel's tower and takes refuge there. The very competent Rapunzel restrains Flynn, hides the tiara and strikes a bargain with him - she will return the tiara to him if he will agree to take her to see those mysterious lights, which he tells her are floating lanterns. Flynn agrees and the two set off on a rollicking adventure. Pursued now, not only by Maximus - a horse from the palace guard who refuses to give up the chase - but also by a pair of thugs Flynn double-crossed AND Mother Gothel, Flynn and Rapunzel learn to trust each other as they make one narrow escape from their pursuers after another.Comments:Tangled is a laugh-out-loud funny family film that will thoroughly entertain both children and adults. The animation is stellar, the story engaging and the pacing excellent, never dragging for a moment. Rapunzel and Flynn are both charming and likeable, making it easy for viewers to root for them. Further, they are surrounded by a terrific supporting cast including tavern thugs with secret dreams and Pascal, Rapunzel's pet chameleon. But it's Maximus who truly steals the show. The expressive horse is brave, determined, sometimes petty, and hilarious. Every scene he's in is solid gold. I would love to see some sort of sequel with Max and Flynn trading quips - particularly since Max doesn't speak at all and the two still seemed to be doing just that through much of Tangled.I did have a couple of quibbles, neither of which significantly impacted my enjoyment of the film. First, the colors often seemed a bit too dark to me, rather grayed out. This impression may well have been exacerbated by the 3D glasses. (ETA: A couple of fellow reviewers have commented that they found the colors bright and vibrant when they viewed the film in 2D. It seems likely that my experience may have had more to do with the theater where I saw the film or with the 3D glasses - or a bit of both. This is especially important since I imagine most Amazon costumers will be purchasing this film in 2D. My thanks to Star Fire and Thomas Plotkin for their input - I really appreciate it!) Second, even though I felt they were well performed, the songs were, IMHO, largely under whelming. With the exception of the lovely ""I See the Light"", I felt they had neither the excitement of previous Disney showstoppers ""Be Our Guest"", ""Under the Sea"" or ""I Just Can't Wait to Be King"" nor the memorable melodies of ""Kiss the Girl"", ""Beauty and the Beast"" or ""Circle of Life"".On the plus side, the film is rich in emotional depth and is blessed with a number of wonderful scenes. My favorite sequence begins with Rapunzel and Flynn entering the village and dancing with the villagers and continues on through their scene on the lake among the floating lanterns. Their happiness in the village, Rapunzel's sense of wonder (and ours!) while surrounded by the lanterns, the romantic song they sing as they realize they're attracted to one another and may be falling in love - it's all perfect. The lantern scene is jaw-droppingly gorgeous - well worth the price of admission on its own and the film's most effective use of 3D. Another scene that I loved for its poignancy centers on the silent communication between Rapunzel's parents as they mourn their lost daughter together just before releasing their floating lantern.I do want to alert parents to one element. The relationship between Rapunzel and Mother Gothel is difficult and layered, dealing with emotional abuse masked with concern and declarations of love. (Mother Gothel's frequent put-downs of Rapunzel, followed by a cheery ""Just kidding!"" had me clenching my teeth.) Young children who are used to a more black and white portrayal of good and evil may be confused by Rapunzel's oft-declared love for the woman she believes is her mother and by Rapunzel's conflicted feelings when she first leaves the tower with Flynn. This unhealthy relationship doesn't overshadow the film, nor does it steal the humor and fun from it, but parents should be prepared for questions children might ask and concerns they might have. These questions may not come until a second or third viewing, when children have already seen the scenes where Mother Gothel more explicitly reveals her true nature and so have that knowledge when viewing the early mother/daughter scenes.That said, I still loved the film and believe it's a great addition to Disney's animated classics. Lastly, let me just add a big ""Yeah!"" to the film's final moments when Flynn, back in narrator mode, reveals that it was several years before he and Rapunzel got married. A much better message for children than the more usual we-saw-each-other-twice-before-tying-the-knot which seems almost de rigueur in so many fairy tales.Highly recommended.Note: Author, editor and fairy tale aficionado Terri Windling has written a wonderful essay about the long history of the ""Maiden in a Tower"" story which, it turns out, predates the Brothers Grimm by more than 200 years. I found reading about how a story evolves over time and across cultures absolutely fascinating. (Essay is available at Windling's website. A simple google search - ""Rapunzel"" + ""Terri Windling"" - should get you there.) ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(6681, 6695)",1,0.0,False

Further, they are surrounded by a terrific supporting cast including tavern thugs with secret dreams and Pascal, Rapunzel's pet chameleon. But it's Maximus who truly steals the show. The expressive horse is brave, determined, sometimes petty, and hilarious. Every scene he's in is solid gold. I would love to see some sort of sequel with Max and Flynn trading quips - particularly since Max doesn't speak at all and the two still seemed to be doing just that through much of Tangled.I did have a couple of quibbles, neither of which significantly impacted my enjoyment of the film. First, the colors often seemed a bit too dark to me, rather grayed out. This impression may well have been exacerbated by the 3D glasses. (ETA: A couple of fellow reviewers have commented that they found the colors bright and vibrant when they viewed the film in 2D. It seems likely that my experience may have had more to do with the theater where I saw the film or with the 3D glasses - or a bit of both. This is especially important since I imagine most Amazon costumers will be purchasing this film in 2D. My thanks to Star Fire and Thomas Plotkin for their input - I really appreciate it!) Second, even though I felt they were well performed, the songs were, IMHO, largely under whelming. With the exception of the lovely ""I See the Light"", I felt they had neither the excitement of previous Disney showstoppers ""Be Our Guest"", ""Under the Sea"" or ""I Just Can't Wait to Be King"" nor the memorable melodies of ""Kiss the Girl"", ""Beauty and the Beast"" or ""Circle of Life"".On the plus side, the film is rich in emotional depth and is blessed with a number of wonderful scenes. My favorite sequence begins with Rapunzel and Flynn entering the village and dancing with the villagers and continues on through their scene on the lake among the floating lanterns. Their happiness in the village, Rapunzel's sense of wonder (and ours!) while surrounded by the lanterns, the romantic song they sing as they realize they're attracted to one another and may be falling in love - it's all perfect. The lantern scene is jaw-droppingly gorgeous - well worth the price of admission on its own and the film's most effective use of 3D. Another scene that I loved for its poignancy centers on the silent communication between Rapunzel's parents as they mourn their lost daughter together just before releasing their floating lantern.I do want to alert parents to one element. The relationship between Rapunzel and Mother Gothel is difficult and layered, dealing with emotional abuse masked with concern and declarations of love. (Mother Gothel's frequent put-downs of Rapunzel, followed by a cheery ""Just kidding!"" had me clenching my teeth.) Young children who are used to a more black and white portrayal of good and evil may be confused by Rapunzel's oft-declared love for the woman she believes is her mother and by Rapunzel's conflicted feelings when she first leaves the tower with Flynn. This unhealthy relationship doesn't overshadow the film, nor does it steal the humor and fun from it, but parents should be prepared for questions children might ask and concerns they might have. These questions may not come until a second or third viewing, when children have already seen the scenes where Mother Gothel more explicitly reveals her true nature and so have that knowledge when viewing the early mother/daughter scenes.That said, I still loved the film and believe it's a great addition to Disney's animated classics. Lastly, let me just add a big ""Yeah!"" to the film's final moments when Flynn, back in narrator mode, reveals that it was several years before he and Rapunzel got married. A much better message for children than the more usual we-saw-each-other-twice-before-tying-the-knot which seems almost de rigueur in so many fairy tales.Highly recommended.Note: Author, editor and fairy tale aficionado Terri Windling has written a wonderful essay about the long history of the ""Maiden in a Tower"" story which, it turns out, predates the Brothers Grimm by more than 200 years. I found reading about how a story evolves over time and across cultures absolutely fascinating. (Essay is available at Windling's website. A simple google search - ""Rapunzel"" + ""Terri Windling"" - should get you there.) ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(6681, 6695)",1,0.0,False

The second sequel (arguably the unneeded sequel)to the action-fantasy franchise has a different director at the helm, in the name of Rob Cohen (The Fast and the Furious). If the first two films were any indication, Stephen Sommers is indeed a good action director; he knows how to make the wide camera angle, doesn't rely on slow motion and knows how to make his actors look quite cool. Rob Cohen also has a good resume, but you can tell that Sommers' absence was felt, but the film does have that Sommers` pace. (Sommers is present as producer)Thousands of years ago, an evil emperor who has mastered the mystic arts had the malevolent intentions to take over the entire world. Betrayed by his general (Russell Wong), and cursed by the beauteous witch, Zi Yuan (Michelle Yeoh), the evil emperor was buried under the sands of time. Now awakened by an ambitious military leader (Anthony Wong), it is up to Rick (Brendan Fraser) and Evelyn O'Connell (Maria Bello), together with their all-grown up son Alex (Luke Ford) and the mysterious Lin (Hong Kong's own Isabella Leong) to try to stop the second rise of the evil emperor and his army. Here we go again....The film's plot is very simple and feels like a rehash of the first two installments. The script by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar is mainly built around the action and is full of familiar plot elements that it offers no surprises. While it's not exactly a lost cause, since there are some new additions to the screenplay that helped it out--(the Tibetan CGI kindly Abominable Snowmen, subtle doses of humor, Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh) the film does lack a good dose of emotions. The father and son relationship offers nothing we haven't seen before, the bored ""retired"" adventurers gimmick, and the awakening of the two armies of the dead to oppose each other has been done numerous times.The performances by the cast is good for the most part. Brendan Fraser is in familiar territory and Maria Bello (who takes over the sorely missed Rachel Weisz's role) does a convincing English woman. The two do have chemistry but they have so little to work with and they look too young and unconvincing to have a grown-up son. Speaking of chemistry, there are no sparks between Luke Ford and beauteous Isabella Leong, their time together onscreen falls flat. Leong is a capable actress (as proven in her Asian films) but her character is so severely underdeveloped along with Michelle Yeoh`s. Which is such a pity since Lin and Zi Yuan are the most interesting characters in the film. This would be difficult to do, since they may steal the spotlight from Rick and Evy, but the film would have stayed aloft if their characters took on more than supporting roles. Jet Li had limited screen time but he does still have that charisma that catches your eye, Li can act and fit's the role of the emperor. However, to hamper the actors further, the dialogue of the film is VERY clich&eacute;d that it proved a little empty. I did say that there were subtle bits of humor that helped a little but I didn't say they were original.Thankfully, the action sequences were entertaining to watch. The film has some nicely placed scenes of action, the shots are ""spiffy"" and the CGI effects, while not the best we've seen are quite good. Although the use of effects are somewhat clich&eacute;d also. Water and ice effects, wind and fire, there's even a nice looking three headed dragon and the snowmen, armies of the dead--all good but not groundbreaking. The fights were good but not great, this is the part that you feel that it was fluid enough but it could have been better. I missed Stephen Sommers even though Rob Cohen did an acceptable job I think.In closing, ""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" is fun enough on the entertainment factor but it just feels a little flat. The action sequences were good but without the proper set up and emotions, the action felt like it was a simple excuse to delay the film's outcome. The film is so predictable that it throws its punches too soon and it overlooked several details that the story itself was also underdeveloped and full of holes.

I was excited when they put the mask on and we hear that ohh burr sound and I was excited when he was propped up....but what the hell...I was totally disappointed when Vader cut loose of his shackles and screamed NOOOOOOO..I was totally ashamed...but hey, I we get to see the start of the Death Star, which was good and how Luke was taking to Tatooine with Obi Wan looking after him and how Leia was brought to The Organa family....Jimmy Smits (Tv's NYPD Blue, Running Scared) was Bail Organa, who wasnt bad...how Yoda went into exile and so on and so forth. Another good but bad thing...the good thing is that Jar Jar Binks is barely in here but the bad thing is that he didnt die....damnit George Lucas!! EMPIRE is still the best of the bundle...of course adn this one isnt that bad but it certainly is much better then ATTACK OF THE CLONES was by far.

One minute he's the hot-shot of the High School Baseball team, the next minute you're watching him get decorated dressed in whites.  You're so proud of him, even if you don't know what it is he does, precisely, and all your family loves him.So, as I say, no International Lounge Lizard with nouveau riche tastes, or a necklace of Euro-Trash beauties around his neck.But, when the movie begins and they haul him out of the sea, nearly dead, you see it.  And as he recovers from his wounds, it becomes clearer.  He's one of the brightest and the best; clean as a whistle, sharp as a tack.  Dad's favorite boy, memory clouded, somehow, and on a mission even he doesn't remember.  And whithout making any judgment about it, you've got a great deal invested in him; in seeming him safe and his enemies identified and routed.  Therefore, when the action begins, and it does immediately, one watches him negotiate the thorny mazes of predicaments of incredible complexity and menace, with ingenuity and dispatch.  One of the best demonhstrations of what he can do happens when he arrives in Paris, after getting his money and passports out of a Swiss bank.

There are no shameful and insincere attempts to conjure up a facile moral to the story by juggling religioius symbols.  The sexual attraction of the hero and heroine to one another isn't either lewd or tricky, but grows inevitably out of the inter-reliance that builds between them as they cling to life and avoid discovery.  What attracts her is his freshness, frankness, fearlessness and his determination to protect her from enemies that are really his alone.  Their care for each other becomes as artless and as inevitable as sunrise.The sound track is good and the intercut POP music is as one would expect it, but the music is never distracting.Seems to me I've watched this show 3 times now, and it looks better and better every time.

Compared with those movies, this movie is not so great. Compared to the other two prequels, it is the best of the three. It turns away from the tortuous details of Senate politics that infected its predecessor, ""Attack of the Clones"", and tries to get back to the action, relationships, and moral dilemmas that are at the heart of the ""Star Wars"" series. However, this film has many flaws that could have been eradicated with more of a conscientious effort by creator, director, and writer George Lucas.It basically forms a straight line, plot-wise, from Episode Two to Episode Four with no surprises and little character development, and depends upon what you already know about the entire Star Wars mythology to invest you in this movie and its characters rather than the action and dialogue of this one particular film. Also, there is little use made of either Natalie Portman's  Padme Amidala - who actually has very little screen time - or the excellent Samuel L. Jackson, who is completely wasted given the small part that his character has in this film. Why employ such a great actor if you are going to give him lines that any extra could deliver?Additionally, for someone who has spent the last ten or fifteen years learning and living the ways of the Jedi, Hayden Christensen's Anakin Skywalker seems to have very little inner turmoil making a sudden and complete transformation from protector of innocents to the apprentice of evil. He irrationally uses his desire to ensure his wife's safety - when there is no perceivable threat to her health other than his own premonitions - as an excuse to savage anyone who might get in his way and even some who couldn't if they wanted to, such as the ""younglings"" that he slaughters in the Jedi temple at Palpatine's behest. Thus the so-called transformation into Darth Vader is more like the flipping of a switch - more binary than analog.The best performance is that of Ian McDiarmid as Chancellor Palpatine/""The Emporer"".

Compared with those movies, this movie is not so great. Compared to the other two prequels, it is the best of the three. It turns away from the tortuous details of Senate politics that infected its predecessor, ""Attack of the Clones"", and tries to get back to the action, relationships, and moral dilemmas that are at the heart of the ""Star Wars"" series. However, this film has many flaws that could have been eradicated with more of a conscientious effort by creator, director, and writer George Lucas.It basically forms a straight line, plot-wise, from Episode Two to Episode Four with no surprises and little character development, and depends upon what you already know about the entire Star Wars mythology to invest you in this movie and its characters rather than the action and dialogue of this one particular film. Also, there is little use made of either Natalie Portman's  Padme Amidala - who actually has very little screen time - or the excellent Samuel L. Jackson, who is completely wasted given the small part that his character has in this film. Why employ such a great actor if you are going to give him lines that any extra could deliver?Additionally, for someone who has spent the last ten or fifteen years learning and living the ways of the Jedi, Hayden Christensen's Anakin Skywalker seems to have very little inner turmoil making a sudden and complete transformation from protector of innocents to the apprentice of evil. He irrationally uses his desire to ensure his wife's safety - when there is no perceivable threat to her health other than his own premonitions - as an excuse to savage anyone who might get in his way and even some who couldn't if they wanted to, such as the ""younglings"" that he slaughters in the Jedi temple at Palpatine's behest. Thus the so-called transformation into Darth Vader is more like the flipping of a switch - more binary than analog.The best performance is that of Ian McDiarmid as Chancellor Palpatine/""The Emporer"". He has a serpentine smoothness about him as he subtly plants doubts in Skywalker's mind about who is really on the side of evil while deftly handling all of the warring factions of the Republic so that people will actually be grateful when he takes complete power.In summary, if you have seen all of the other Star Wars films you will probably enjoy this one because it fills in all of the gaps and answers all of the remaining questions.

If however, you let your kid see this film, it isn't the fault of the filmmakers, the theaters, or society.  Hey wait, that's what the movie is about!Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman are four young kids in South Park, Colorado.  In the series, they tend to have bizarre misadventures caused by adult misunderstandings and hypocrisy.  In the film, the boys go to see a movie starring their favorite television duo, Terrence and Phillip.  Terrence and Phillip are two Canadians whose material is completely dependent upon swearing and toilet humor.  The Terrence and Phillip film is rated R (just like the South Park movie itself), and after seeing it, the kids begin imitating the duo, much to their parents' chagrin.  At first, they just start swearing more, but things escalate when Kenny accidentally sets himself on fire trying to prove to Cartman that it really is possible to light a fart on fire.  The doctors (one of whom is played by George Clooney, a fan of the show) are unable to save him, Kyle's mother organizes a militant group of mothers to blame Canada for corrupting their youths and causing Kenny's death (and to make sure that no one blames them for bad parenting).On Earth, the boys try to find a way to stop their parents from going to war with Canada.  Also, they each have their own subplot.  Stan tries to prove to a girl he likes that he's political, Kyle tries to stand up to his mother, and Cartman needs to find a way to live with a newly implanted V-Chip that shocks him every time he curses.  Meanwhile in Hell, Kenny learns that Satan and his new boyfriend Saddam Hussein are poised to take over the world should Kyle's mom's war come to pass.The film takes on issues of blame, censorship, racism, and war in addition to numerous others.  Not only do Matt and Trey expertly showcase their opinions, they do it through song!  The songs in the film advance the plot, tackle social issues, and parody established musicals and musical styles.  The boys sing a song about Olympic figure skater Brian Boitano which is a send-up of Disney's Newsies, while Satan sings a song reminiscent of Part of Your World from The Little Mermaid.  Oklahoma! and Les Miserables are also parodied.This is a very polarizing film.  If someone is on the sides of the issues that Matt and Trey attack, they would most likely dislike the film, and anyone who doesn't like excess profanity or toilet humor should also stay away.

In one very crucial way, it breaks tradition with the average domestic thriller: There's no infidelity. There's an awful lot of flirtation, no question, but when it comes to faithfulness, the married man gets high marks. I'm referring to Derek Charles (Idris Elba), a Los Angeles asset manager. He becomes the object of a new office temp's desire, and as we see over the film's 105 minutes, she'll go to just about any lengths to get what she's after. I agree that this is hardly an original premise, and at times, the film seems more interested in being formulaic than in being compelling. But at the very least, it makes due with what little it has, which is to say that it's perfectly acceptable.It's a classic scenario: Not only has Derek just been promoted to the rank of Executive Vice President, he also has a beautiful family and a luxurious new house. He's respected by his colleagues, his superiors trust him deeply, and he has great friends. Things are going really well.Then comes the day he enters an elevator and meets Lisa (Ari Larter), a sultry beauty with long blonde hair and a killer figure. She's carrying a large amount of paperwork, so much so that she inevitably drops them in a moment of clumsiness. Derek, trying to be nice, offers to help her out, and that leads to the next inevitable moment--they reach for the same piece of paper at the same time, resulting in their hands touching. There's nothing subtle about this. For that matter, there's nothing subtle about the entire film, which has no qualms about going for the obvious.Take, for example, a scene that takes place some weeks after Derek and Lisa first meet: Derek walks into the lounge area and sees Lisa on the verge of tears. He assumes she's having boyfriend trouble, and encourages her by saying how pretty she is and how any man would be lucky to know her. In fact, if he was single ... ah, but he doesn't finish his sentence. There are two specific reasons why people do this: (1) some people don't actually mean it when they say it, so there's no point in completing the thought; (2) some people are afraid that they do mean what they're saying, and therefore don't want to incriminate themselves any further. What reasoning do you think Derek followed? Choose whichever one you think applies. I have a feeling the filmmakers wanted it to be ambiguous.It isn't long before Derek regrets ever having met Lisa. In spite of the fact that she's incredibly efficient (at times frighteningly so), she rapidly becomes overly friendly, pretty much to the point of intrusiveness. It isn't until the annual office Christmas party that things begin taking a darker turn; Lisa takes advantage of the fact that Derek has had one too many and tries to have sex with him in a bathroom stall. He wards her off, but that doesn't stop her from trying again the next day, when she insistently gets into his car as he's leaving work.Before I go any further, let me backtrack a bit and talk about Derek's wife, Sharon (Beyonc&eacute; Knowles), who looks bootylicious but acts, for the most part, like a typical wife and mother. When she first learns that a new female temp is working for Derek, she jokingly chides him for allowing such a thing to happen. Then the two actually meet, and while it's too early for Sharon to be suspicious, she definitely shows concern. Let's face it--Lisa's a beautiful woman and Derek is a handsome man. It doesn't take a genius to see what could potentially happen.As Lisa's attempts at seduction grow more and more brazen, Derek finds himself in a very awkward position, desperate to maintain his reputation but even more desperate to distance himself from Lisa. There inevitably comes a point at which Sharon finds out that something isn't quite right, that Lisa labors under the delusion that Derek is in love with her. This paves the way for the final confrontation, which, for me at least, was the weakest section of the film, designed less like a plausible plot point and more like an excuse to have two women fighting. I have no doubt many will see this movie specifically for this scene.There are other aspects that don't work too well, including a strange camaraderie between Lisa and a gay office assistant named Patrick (Matthew Humphreys). Within the context of this story, I failed to see how this character was necessary--other than a few stereotypical one-liners and some witty banter, he contributes nothing to the story. There's also Derek's office buddy, Ben (Jerry O'Connell), a sex-hungry party animal who seems to lack the conviction of his personality. He too contributes nothing to the story. Fortunately, these are side characters that have little bearing on either the central story or the three main characters, all of which are the most developed components of ""Obsessed."" While hardly a masterpiece, it's an entertaining thriller that achieved exactly what it wanted to achieve. And even if Beyonc&eacute; Knowles is better suited for more meaningful characters like Etta James, she has once again proven herself as a competent actress.

The books, which I've never read, were bestsellers and the recent release of ""New Moon,"" the film is breaking records. Teenage girls are absolutely gaga for the star Robert Pattinson and it finally intrigued me enough to watch this film. I do have a slightly biased opinion as the entire premise of the film seemed ludicrous to me, but I found a glimmer of hope in the film's director Catherine Hardwicke, who was responsible for the very honest look at teenagers with the film ""Thirteen.""What really surprised me about this film is that it doesn't have much of a plot. Kristen Stewart plays Isabella ""Bella"" Swan, who moves from Arizona to Forks, Washington to stay with her father (Billy Burke). Bella inexplicably begins school moments after arriving in Forks and discovers The Cullen's, a group of mysterious foster kids from Alaska. Even more mysterious and intriguing, to her and the rest of the student body, is Edward Cullen (Pattinson), a quiet, pale, reserved 17-year-old. Bella starts to notice the Cullen's are more than just a little different and when Edward stops a van from running her over, she realizes that he may not even be human...99% of the world knows that he's a vampire, but not a vampire of the typical, blood-sucking variety. The Cullen's are ""vegetarian"" vampires who only snack on the blood of animals. There's a story here, obviously but nothing really happens in it.Almost everything here is underwritten, characters and plot included. The characterization is particularly hollow and calling the characters ""characters,"" is inaccurate; these are names with pretty faces attached to them. We're talking about a film here with an uneventful plot and characters completely void of depth. Twilight is supposed to be a supernatural love story geared towards a teenage demographic, but where's the emotion or poignancy that a love story needs in order to work as one? It's certainly not here. The dialogue in this movie is so melodramatic, I almost felt nauseous. The conversations between Bella and Edward are particularly embarrassing to watch.

The books, which I've never read, were bestsellers and the recent release of ""New Moon,"" the film is breaking records. Teenage girls are absolutely gaga for the star Robert Pattinson and it finally intrigued me enough to watch this film. I do have a slightly biased opinion as the entire premise of the film seemed ludicrous to me, but I found a glimmer of hope in the film's director Catherine Hardwicke, who was responsible for the very honest look at teenagers with the film ""Thirteen.""What really surprised me about this film is that it doesn't have much of a plot. Kristen Stewart plays Isabella ""Bella"" Swan, who moves from Arizona to Forks, Washington to stay with her father (Billy Burke). Bella inexplicably begins school moments after arriving in Forks and discovers The Cullen's, a group of mysterious foster kids from Alaska. Even more mysterious and intriguing, to her and the rest of the student body, is Edward Cullen (Pattinson), a quiet, pale, reserved 17-year-old. Bella starts to notice the Cullen's are more than just a little different and when Edward stops a van from running her over, she realizes that he may not even be human...99% of the world knows that he's a vampire, but not a vampire of the typical, blood-sucking variety. The Cullen's are ""vegetarian"" vampires who only snack on the blood of animals. There's a story here, obviously but nothing really happens in it.Almost everything here is underwritten, characters and plot included. The characterization is particularly hollow and calling the characters ""characters,"" is inaccurate; these are names with pretty faces attached to them. We're talking about a film here with an uneventful plot and characters completely void of depth. Twilight is supposed to be a supernatural love story geared towards a teenage demographic, but where's the emotion or poignancy that a love story needs in order to work as one? It's certainly not here. The dialogue in this movie is so melodramatic, I almost felt nauseous. The conversations between Bella and Edward are particularly embarrassing to watch. This does not sound like the ""Romeo & Juliet"" of the 21st Century, but the banter of two prepubescent children.  A quick example; ""Beautiful?

I own Widescreen VHS tapes of the originals (the set released in 1995 before the Special Editions) and I'm quite pleased with them. However, for the sake of argument, I rented the DVDs from my local Blockbuster, just to see what George Lucas had done with each movie. What follows is (I hope) a fair assessment, as a fan of the ORIGINAL original trilogy.The picture and sound are excellent, just what one would expect from a DVD Transfer. The Star Wars universe has always been a visually imaginative one, and deserves to be viewed with high quality picture and sound. The DVD Transfer does the movies extreme justice in that field. So the movies get an A+ there. As far as revisions are concerned, I can understand that George Lucas certainly has the right to make changes if he wants, but like any artist, I think he should have taken a step back first and asked if he was really making a change for the better. For example:-I can't understand his logic for changing the sound that Obi-Wan makes to frighten away the Sand People in ""Star Wars: A New Hope."" In the original, he sounded like a ferocious beast, something they might actually be scared of. I really can't describe the sound that he makes on the DVD, but I do know that it does not sound terrifying, and it doesn't seem logical to me that a group of Sand People would run from it (even if they are easily startled).-However, I can understand George Lucas's logic for having Temuera Morrison redo all of Boba Fett's dialogue in ""The Empire Strikes Back"" (given what we learned in ""Attack of the Clones""), but honestly, I don't think the new voice fits the character that well. The original voice (that of Jason Wingreen) was better suited to Fett's personality of an emotionless, profit-driven hunter.-Likewise, I can see why he would put Hayden Christensen at the end of ""Return of the Jedi,"" but Christensen just doesn't seem to give off the outstanding look of fatherly pride that Sebastian Shaw was giving in the original.-Speaking of ""Jedi,"" my verdict on the ending is a toss-up, since I was never a huge fan of how the original ended (it was cute, but I felt it still left something to be desired. The highlight was the exchanged glances between Luke and the spirits of Obi-Wan, Yoda, and his father). I thought John Williams's music fit the galaxy-wide celebration of the Special Edition and sounded better than the original Ewok routine (and again, I can understand George Lucas inserting Naboo into that sequence on the DVD, and don't have a problem with that, since he's tooling around with something he put in back in 1997), but at the same time it didn't feel up to par with the music in the rest of the trilogy.-And I too feel that having Greedo fire first more or less screws up the character arc for Han Solo, an arc that was, in some ways, more satisfying than Luke's. In the first movie, we see a mercenary who doesn't care about anyone except for maybe his ship and Chewbacca, but has a change of heart at the end. Then we see someone who has his foot in the door, but it's mostly due to his feelings for the princess. Then finally, we finish with someone who has not only taken up a cause (with no thought of any sort of reward), but has matured to the point where (before he learns that Luke and Leia are related) he's willing to step out of the way if it will make his love happy. I never felt that Han needed to be a white-horse hero right from the get-go, but I think that what happens on the DVD (Han and Greedo shooting at the same time) is a fair compromise. It's not perfect, but I think Han still keeps his reputation for the first movie.-There is one scene in the Special Editions that I  particularly enjoyed, and that was a scene from ""A New Hope"" filmed back in 1977 (but never used in the original theatrical release) that better establishes the relationship between Luke and his childhood friend, Biggs Darklighter. As most character development scenes usually do, it wound up getting cut. But sadly, that was perhaps the only change that I truly enjoyed (until the day I die, I will say that the original band in ""Return of the Jedi"" sounded much better than the overblown production we saw in the Special Edition).When all is said and done, I give this set one star for the picture quality, another for the sound quality, and the third for the Bonus Disc (Lucas definitely delivered with that one, giving fans all the goodies that they've come to expect from movies on DVD). But as for the way that he keeps chopping up the classic trilogy, my father once used the following example in a conversation about Star Wars. He said that if you look at the Mona Lisa, she's completely out of style. Someone, if they were so inclined, should repaint her in more modern dress, and give her a more contemporary hairstyle (and maybe a navel ring or lip piercing). I won't deny that George Lucas has the right to alter these movies, but ultimately, it's up to individual Star Wars fans to determine if these changes make the movies that we grew up with more enjoyable. For me, the answer is no. But as I said, I have my VHS Box Set, so I'm not complaining. If, for you, the answer is yes, then by all means, I recommend the DVDs.

Gillian Anderson's character is in most of these season nine episodes, but far too often she comes a bit unglued regarding her absent former partner.  Granted, we have enjoyed every one of Scully's emotional outbursts throughout the years, but the explosions strike me as being excessive.  When Scully is forced to play the true believer opposite the skepticism of Doggett, in the more mundane cases investigated this final season, things are fine.  All things considered, the episodes that focus on Agent John Doggett (e.g., ""John Doe,"" ""Underneath,"" ""Release"") are the most interesting in the ninth season.As the final season begins Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) has once again disappeared, but this time of his own choice since he knows his presence is putting Scully and their son William in danger.  Agent Doggett (Robert Patrick) is trying to find Muldar (""Nothing Important Happened Today"") as part of his investigation of Deputy Director Kersh (James Pickens Jr.), but Scully and Assistant Director Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) finally convince him to drop the matter.  Scully is now teaching at the FBI Academy, helping Doggett and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) from time to time, but fully aware that William is in danger.  It is William's fate, even more than Mulder's disappearance, that defines the arc of this final season.While watching these episodes again, at midnight each night, I found myself wondering if the season could have been stronger if not only Mulder but also Scully had been jettisoned and the season had been about agents Doggett and Reyes.  As a general rule in the final seasons I intended to enjoy the standalone investigations (e.g, ""Lord of the Flies,"" ""Scary Monsters""), than those that focus on the show's mythology (e.g., ""Provenance,"" ""Providence"").  The final season is a mix of episodes where one week the focus is primarily on Reyes (""Audrey Pauley"") and the next almost entirely on Doggett (""John Doe"").  Sometimes Dogget and Reyes work together (""Daemonicus"") and then again it could be Reyes and Scully (""Hellbound""), or maybe all three (""Underneath""). Things are clearly progressing more quickly with Doggett and Reyes on the romantic front (""4-D,"" ""Release""), but then you would be hard pressed to name a couple that took longer to be a couple than Mulder and Scully.  In the comedy department that standout episodes is clearly ""Improbable,"" which features Bert Reynolds as a checker-playing God (Einstein always said God did not play dice with the universe, but he never excluded any board games).With one exception, the twisted Brady Bunch tale ""Sunshine Days,"" the final episodes that aired are all about tying up lose ends.  ""Jump the Shark"" becomes the final ride of the Lone Gunmen, ""William"" finds Scully reaching a fateful decision regarding her son, and the best of the bunch, ""Release"" brings closure to the unsolved murder of Doggett's son.  ""The Truth,"" the double-episode finale, proves to be unsatisfying, but I think expectations were so exceedingly high that it was impossible for fans to view the end with anything other than regret.  I like the final fade out, but the trial of Mulder is clearly a mockery, which means we are treading water for most of the story until the big finish because nothing that happens there matters.  There is a big bang near the end, but the saga of Mulder and Scully really ends with silence and a set up that will allow Chris Carter and the gang to do anything they want with the planned second ""X-Files"" movie.  Final Note: It would be my recommendation that you watch all of ""The Lone Gunman"" episodes before or concurrently with ""The X-Files: The Complete Ninth Season,"" so that you end you ""X-Files"" experience with ""The Truth"" and not watching ""Jump the Shark"" a second time.

Sometimes Dogget and Reyes work together (""Daemonicus"") and then again it could be Reyes and Scully (""Hellbound""), or maybe all three (""Underneath""). Things are clearly progressing more quickly with Doggett and Reyes on the romantic front (""4-D,"" ""Release""), but then you would be hard pressed to name a couple that took longer to be a couple than Mulder and Scully.  In the comedy department that standout episodes is clearly ""Improbable,"" which features Bert Reynolds as a checker-playing God (Einstein always said God did not play dice with the universe, but he never excluded any board games).With one exception, the twisted Brady Bunch tale ""Sunshine Days,"" the final episodes that aired are all about tying up lose ends.  ""Jump the Shark"" becomes the final ride of the Lone Gunmen, ""William"" finds Scully reaching a fateful decision regarding her son, and the best of the bunch, ""Release"" brings closure to the unsolved murder of Doggett's son.  ""The Truth,"" the double-episode finale, proves to be unsatisfying, but I think expectations were so exceedingly high that it was impossible for fans to view the end with anything other than regret.  I like the final fade out, but the trial of Mulder is clearly a mockery, which means we are treading water for most of the story until the big finish because nothing that happens there matters.  There is a big bang near the end, but the saga of Mulder and Scully really ends with silence and a set up that will allow Chris Carter and the gang to do anything they want with the planned second ""X-Files"" movie.  Final Note: It would be my recommendation that you watch all of ""The Lone Gunman"" episodes before or concurrently with ""The X-Files: The Complete Ninth Season,"" so that you end you ""X-Files"" experience with ""The Truth"" and not watching ""Jump the Shark"" a second time.

Soon they encounter a strange driver on the road who nearly runs them right off the road. As they drive on, they see him again, this time, he's off the road, and they see him throwing bodies down a pipe. Now, all of this believe it or not works. But, what happens inbetween this, doesn't work.First of all, the two kids start talking about their mother. Okay, what about her? I don't know. They say that she's change, that she;s not herself anymore. OK, why? Does she have a physical problem? Is she breaking up with her husband? Did her husband die? Or is she just lonely? We never know.

The writers were just trying to make this characters have a conversation for the film doesn't become boring until the action happens. But, why make the characters talk about things that won't have anything to do with the movie. We don't want to hear it. Why not try writing USEFUL dialogue?After the first half hour, the film become odd, but, I was willing to go along with it. We find out something about the driver in the begining of the movie (don't worry I won't spoil it). And then we start to second guess our opinion of why we rented this in the first place. So now, the film just becomes silly. Here's an example, the kids are soon told they whenever they hear the Harry Warren song ""Jeepers Creepers"" expect trouble. Never in all my life would I have expected the song ""Jeepers Creepers"" to represent evil! Also, we are told that the ""crepper"" attacks ever 23 years! And the funny thing is, no one else knows about this. That leads to another question. Exactly how long has this been going on?Director Victor Salva is not a talentless director I feel. He might be able to actually make a good, scary horror flick one of these days. He just needs to prepare himself better. That's what really breaks this film. The elements are there for a good movie, but, they just weren't used properly. Maybe ""Jeepers Creepers 2"" will be better. Who knows. I personally would advise you not to watch this movie. If you like the teen horror genre I prefer ""Scream"", ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", and ""The Glass House"".Bottom-line: Suspensefull, but ultimately silly horror film that just doesn't scare us enough but makes us think of what could of been.

It's hard to watch this and not see the similarities and also knowing that Battle Royale came out 10 years before this movie or book was even thought of. I didn't exactly buy into the hype of this movie because of so and actually took my time before deciding to sit down and watch it for the first time. This movie I think was just a bunch of hype the same as Black Swan and all those others than pop up out of no where and all of a sudden seem to capture the attention of the box office. Maybe it's one of those pictures where the book is different and much better but as a movie this one feels overly long and quite boring in a lot of parts. If you've seen Battle Royale or have not, you should definitely watch it. It goes into detail about the things this movie skimps over and explores the characters on a much deeper level. Watching The hunger games I felt I was watching almost like a B-movie rip off of Battle Royale, or how can I put it... it's a lot more toned down and that's which kills the shock value of the story. I think this is one of those movies you only enjoy if you've read the book and get to see it come alive. As for me it just didn't cut it especially since I've seen this done before only better with a much better plot. I'm sure there's die hard fanatics for ""The hunger games"" but if you've never seen ""Battle Royale"" than you really are just praising a false idol.What makes this movie even more painstaking to watch is that it is long and not very engaging. I found myself pausing the video and running off to do other tasks, and then coming back to it. The movie just seemed to go on and on and on dragging out scenes forever and then having the nerve to give you one of those open endings. This movie is over 2 hours long and the story hardly has any real dialogue to it. You'll find yourself more mesmerized by trying to figure out the ridiculous fashions of this futuristic world. To me that was the more interesting part to watch especially the awkwardly shaped beard of one of the head figure characters. What also struck me was the character Rue and the uproar about the casting for that character. I couldn't believe how nasty people were over the casting of a cute little girl to play her character that basically only had a couple of lines to say. I mean I think if you blinked you'd miss her role in this movie. It really goes to show just how petty certain people can be over absolutely nothing (probably some of these people randomly down voting reviews). Especially in the case of a movie where the race of characters was never described. The biggest surprise was seeing Lenny Kravitz in the film. I didn't even know he was in to acting but his character was random enough so whatever.The one thing I think that really hurt this movie the most was the lack of explanation in the film. The state of the society is never really explained. Why there are 12 districts and all of them are basically low class working districts and the city is lush and rich is never explained. What the ""hunger"" part about the entire game/story is about. They only hint at a scene where the main character is starving in flash backs or surprised to get a piece of bread from a friend saying ""is this real"" but that's all you get. No explanation at all as to why these districts are basically laborers that provide necessities for the well to do but live in poverty themselves. Just from the hints and I mean very few hints in the movie the children fighting all come from these repressed low class labor societies where they are picked at random to fight in these games and chosen to be the victor (btw that plot is never explained you have to piece it together yourself throughout the entire movie). It looked like the participating districts were rewarded with food or something if I saw correctly in the riots (also unexplained) but whatever. This is just a bad movie for lots of reasons but mostly for not explaining things that should be explained like the background for the story at least. There is just a simple clip shown in the movie about a war and the games sort of being like the Olympics to show that courage and strength still exists (yeah, still very pointless).Here's where Battle Royale does everything so much better. The plot of a group of students being forcefully captured by the government and thrown into a Military war/social project called ""The Program"". The kids are handed weapons and supplies at random and told only one of them can survive and they have to kill all of their classmates if they want to make it home alive. The kids don't really understand what is going on (not even the bombs/tracking devices) around their neck. They at first are hesitant to participate in the game but when others start killing each other it suddenly becomes a game of instinct and survival. Some of the kids form social pacts to survive, some like to survive alone, and some just enjoy killing whomever they can find, and some just refuse to participate and try to find another way out. Battle Royale does the story better because its almost like a study of human survival. You get a chance to learn about the background on the characters and their relationship to the other characters which is what makes seeing one of them die or get killed more personal. You don't get to explore any other characters in The Hunger Games but the two main characters ""Bow girl"" and ""Guy who is useless"". There's also Rue who character depth includes ""These are Mocking Jays we use them to signal time in my district"" and that's about as much as you get. For a 2.5hr movie I find The Hunger Games to be extremely vague in a lot of areas it shouldn't be.So basically overall... if you want to see a GOOD movie about Young adults being forced to kill other young adults watch Battle Royale.

Cunningham. Not only that, he actually published the mailing address of the only known star in the movie: Betsy Palmer, asking readers to express their contempt for this movie. Roger Ebert knew the tirade against Cunningham was a bum rap, because he had actually met the man. He even gave a 4-star review of his earlier work as a producer (Wes Craven's 1971 film THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT). He hated this movie as much as Siskel and wondered why such a nice man would make such a despicable movie. Having seen FRIDAY THE 13th many times since 1984 as well as all the follow-up films, I feel both of these critics were really overreacting. I actually watched their old SNEAK PREVIEWS special titled ""Women in Danger"", where they attacked FRIDAY THE 13TH for something that I felt was a quality in the movie.Even if you have never seen FRIDAY THE 13TH, you are familiar with the movie. In 1957 a young boy drowned at Camp Crystal Lake: a summer camp on the East Coast. One year later, two counselors were brutally murdered. The camp was closed down. 22 years later the town of Crystal Lake believes that the camp has a curse. The Cristy family who had founded the camp went broke, but the youngest member, Steve, intended to reopen it. He hires 7 camp counselors to help out. But on Friday the 13th, somebody begins murdering the counselors one by one, until only one of them is left. She learns the truth about who the killer is, which is connected to the boy who drowned, and has to fight for her own life before she winds up defeating the killer.I will not reveal who the killer turns out to be because that is one of the surprises in this movie. Siskel and Ebert criticized that the whole movie shows the POV of the killer, as if that were making it a contempt for women. They praised HALLOWEEN because we see the killer early on. Not to criticize HALLOWEEN in any way, since it is also a great horror movie, but when the killer's identity is revealed in FRIDAY THE 13TH you are surprised that this person is the one responsible. By not showing who the killer is until we're supposed to know it actually adds to the intensity.Betsy Palmer was the only known star in this movie. She was a well known star on television in the 1950's who mainly took the movie for financial reasons. One of the actors became a big-time Hollywood star: Kevin Bacon. He has one of the three best untimely demises in the movie.(It is amazing that a whole lot of the actors who did FRIDAY THE 13TH movies have had successful movie and television careers.The person who is really the biggest star is the F/X makeup wizard: Tom Savini. He actually creates convincing illusions of the characters being horribly murdered. The Blu-Ray edition has a featurette on how he did those amazing effects. However, I think a more detailed explanation can be found the the deluxe hardcover book about the FRIDAY THE 13TH franchise: CRYSTAL LAKE MEMORIES. Although this movie is certainly more bloody and violent than John Carpenter's original HALLOWEEN, the way Savini is able to depict the murders is really creative.I would like to add another thing. One of the criticism's of the FRIDAY THE 13TH films is that the characters are so stupid they are set up just to be killed. None of the characters are exactly well developed, I'll give you that. But none of the victims did I think really deserved to die. One of them does some annoying things but that doesn't make him a total idiot. Some of the characters in the sequels certainly fit that bill, but only the killer in FRIDAY THE 13TH deserves it. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3720, 3734)",1,0.0,False

Cunningham. Not only that, he actually published the mailing address of the only known star in the movie: Betsy Palmer, asking readers to express their contempt for this movie. Roger Ebert knew the tirade against Cunningham was a bum rap, because he had actually met the man. He even gave a 4-star review of his earlier work as a producer (Wes Craven's 1971 film THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT). He hated this movie as much as Siskel and wondered why such a nice man would make such a despicable movie.

Mel Gibson stars as Father Graham Hess, who has lost all Faith in God ever since his wife died in a terrible car accident. One day, Graham thinks his children, Morgan and Bo (Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin) are missing in the corn fields. He and his brother, Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix), go out searching for them and discover the legendary Crop Circles in the field. At first, Graham and Merrill insist that it's nothing but teenagers playing jokes, but things start getting creepy when they watch TV and find out that Crop Circles are being found all across the Globe, according to the mysterious news that keeps on being repeated on every single radio station and television channel. When the family dogs start acting up, they are put outside and not much later, one of them dies. Other strange occurences that happen on the farm are that they keep on getting strange signals from Morgan's walkie talkie and someone--or something--has been tresspassing onto their land every night. Morgan keeps on insisting that it's &quot;extra terrestrials&quot; trying to make contact with Earth, but Graham won't believe it. However, when nothing else in Graham's theories seem to work, it all adds up to the fact that maybe--just MAYBE--Morgan might be right.MY OVERALL THOUGHTS: M. Night Shyamalan has taken the elements of religion, science, fiction, and even a little bit of horror, twisted them together, and turned them (along with top-notch acting performances, great special effects, and a superb storyline), into a spectacular and spooky film. Mel Gibson gives one of his best performances to-date, as the retired minster who's lack of self-belief in religion really nearly drives him to insanity with the Crop Circles. Joaquin Phoenix also gives a superb performance as Graham's younger brother who came to live with the family after Graham's wife died. Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin are amazing as the kids who believe what's really causing the Crop Circles to form are aliens trying to give Earth signals, as there are only a limited number of them and they are basically the same. The supporting cast does well, too...and M. Night Shyalaman even makes an appearence in the supporting cast, as he usually does in his films.

After years of sitting on the fence over the format and drawing fire from the early adopters of DVD like myself, George Lucas has dived into putting out his movies on the digital format with a great deal of enthusiasm. The year before had seen the Indiana Jones trilogy finally finding its way onto DVD to much acclaim and here Lucas uses much the same formula (3 discs for the movies plus a bonus disc of special features) in his release of the original STAR WARS pictures.  Comprised in this set is (the retitled) A NEW HOPE (1977), THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (1980) and RETURN OF THE JEDI (1983).However, whereas the Indiana Jones set featured no film makers audio commentaries (Director Steven Spielberg apparently disapproves of the practice), here we have three very interesting audio commentaries. Appearing on all three tracks are George Lucas as producer (and director of A NEW HOPE), Sound Designer Ben Burtt, Special Effects wizard Dennis Muren and actress Carrie (Princess Leia) Fisher. Also joining the team for THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is the director of that movie Irvin Kirshner (the director of the third movie Richard Marquand sadly passed away years ago).Burtt provides some of the most interesting facts or the tracks, who knew that sound effects could be so fascinating?! It's really interesting to learn some of the most amazing things and places that Burtt used to come up with the sounds of the franchise. If you've ever wondered what was used to come up with the sounds of laser fire or the burps and beeps that R2-D2 uses then you will find the answer among these commentaries.But, in my opinion the best and most thoroughly entertaining commentary is provided for THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. Kershner is a very engaging and fascinating speaker and he relates a number of anecdotal information surrounding the goings-on around the set. He even mentions how he would get so taken by the Yoda puppet that he would catch himself giving direction to the puppet rather than Frank Oz and his team of puppeteers below the stage. Kirsh (as he affectionately known) also recounts the rigors the rigors of filming the Hoth scenes in Norway. He talks about the filming of the scene of Luke stumbling towards the camera (where he sees the image of Ben), with Kersh and crew warm and comfortable shooting from the entranceway of the hotel as actor Hamill was freezing outside.Sadly Fisher is the least talkative of all the participants which leads the commentaries to be top-heavy in technical details.As Indiana Jones had a three hour documentary on the making of those movies, so to does the STAR WARS trilogy. Named ""Empire of Dreams"" and shown in a heavily edited form on US television just prior to the DVD release, the documentary is incredibly detailed on all aspects of production.Knowing how popular and successful we now know STAR WARS was, its interesting to see how skeptical some at the studio (and on the crew) were regarding the viability of the movie. It is noted that the presence of the highly respected Alec Guinness on the set helped the (largely British) crew take the movie more seriously.  What is gratifying is also the reaction to the rough cut of the movie to the Fox board, we learn that one of the executives cried at the screening and rushed home to tell his family about the amazing movie.Perhaps most interesting visually is the screen tests for some of those who tried out for the roles including Kurt Russell trying out for the Han Solo role. Funnily in a modern-day (circa 2004) on-camera interview Mark Hamill is still able to recount his lines from his 1976 screen test.Rounding out the set are a selection of smaller featurettes and trailers. Taken altogether this set is well worth the wait, There are various rumors circulating however that Lucas plans to redo the movies again, this time in 3-D but until the next editions this set will be a valued part of any DVD collection.

As a comic book fan, I fell in love with it (and the director's filmmaking style). ""Signs"" is an edge-of-your-seat drama that may have been too farfetched or ""preachy"" for some. It's the most fun I've had in years! Admittedly, M. Night Shyamalan's directing skills far surpass his storytelling skills, but the young writer/director again proves with his latest blockbuster that he is a filmmaker to be contended with.First let me say there were two things that surprised me about this film:1) There is NO SURPRISE TWIST. There is, admittedly, a REVELATION of sorts, but it's not nearly in the same capacity as his last two films. So don't set yourself up for disappointment and miss a well-made film despite (or because of) the lack of a huge twist.2) There is a lot more humor than I expected. Almost to the point of being distracting. ALMOST. ""Signs"" is essentially a family drama and the dynamics between the characters are extremely amusing.Despite the humor, the tension is almost unbearable at times. I don't recall being this nervous since ""Silence of the Lambs."" It's truly amazing how Shyamalan shifts between the two poles of comic relief and terror with such precision and effectiveness.A word of warning, like all of his other films, ""Signs"" walks a very fine line between surrealism and silliness. Depending on what you expected and what kind of mood you were in, you'll end up loving the film or despising it. There is no middle ground, because Shyamalan leaves no such choice at the end of the film. I've come to realize that you need a particular mindset when you enter a Shyamalan movie: namely, forget what you think you know about what you're going to watch. It's probably not true. Expectations and assumptions are key.Shyamalan's direction has been panned by some critics as being ""pretentious."" I can't disagree more. ""Unbreakable"" may have been pretentious, but ""Signs"" is subtle and understated. The camera never brings attention to itself because story and character require the complete attention of the audience. His writing is excellent, though there are several elements that can be considered ""plot holes."" Dialogue is a little silly but highly effective and, excluding a few anti-mind-reading tin-foil hats, it is the sole reason for the film's humor. Needless to say, Shyamalan's story development is in perfect sync with his visual storytelling.The music is SUPERB. It is one of the most effective scores I've ever heard. And the sound effects are extremely creepy. The resulting mood that is set with the music and sound is highly reminiscent of Bill Paxton's ""Frailty."" But while Paxton's inexperience is evident in his debut film, Shyamalan shows himself to be on top of his game.As for the acting, it is very good overall. Note that there are basically only 4 characters who make up the whole picture. Mel Gibson takes on most of the acting burden, and, as an actor who doesn't have the greatest range, he is his usual star self. Not his best work but good enough. The two child actors are charming and well-cast, but a bit too heavy-handed in their precociousness. In fact, they play their characters with such weirdness that I was expecting one or both of them to be revealed as aliens. Thankfully, such is not the case, cause that would've been way too creepy. Finally we have Joaquin Phoenix who totally steals the movie. Gibson's dry wit scores some chuckles and the kids have their occasional funny lines but Phoenix bats a thousand in all his scenes (sorry, couldn't help myself). He was born to play this part. One of the best scenes he has is the ""I'm a miracle man"" story.As much as I like it, there are four reasons why I'm not giving this film a perfect grade:1) With all the excitement and tension that is built up in the last 20-30 minutes, the climax does not completely satisfy. ""Swing away Merrill"" was a nice touch, though.2) The aspect of the ending dealing with Gibson's faith was appropriate, but it was too pat and simple and abrupt. It needed a little more development.3) This opening and closing title sequences are extremely ugly and unnecessarily HUGE. I can live with them since they're homages to Hitchcock but I will never like them.4) SPOILER: For a being who is super fast and fairly strong, the alien in the final scene did nothing to fight back. He just stood there waiting to be hit.All in all, scarier than ""Panic Room,"" superior to ""Frailty,"" and funnier than any thriller I've ever seen, ""Signs"" is the best film of the summer so far.

The movie has many sleek and cool musical numbers, that have just the right amount of 'punch' that it never gets boring. When the music came on right in the beginning (5,6,7,8) I knew that I was in for a good long ride.The performances given by Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellwegger, Queen Latifah and Richard Gere are perfect! With Catherine standing out a little bit more, because of her musical background (she deserved the Oscar). Her opening act of 'All That Jazz' was flawless, and really got you in the movie. Her vocal tone is very strong and her dancing was right on the money! She's incredible. Renee Zellwegger's 'Roxie' performance and number is prestine, complete with mirrors and dancers behind her. She got those notes right up the there, with that moment being her's all the way. Queen Latifah gave her role of Miss. Mama Morton a bit hit, with her tough talking fast attitude performance that was a complete scene stealer. And finally, Richard Gere's tap-dancing interlude is a knockout with him doing all the tapping himself. I was left speechless.The Cinematography and Art Direction of this film is completely right out there. Though, maybe not as big as Moulin Rouge, (another musical that I love) It was completely accepted. The difference between Moulin Rouge and Chicago is that Moulin Rouge has a bigger scale that covered a lot of the Big Paris Landscape of 1899. While Chicago is more intimate and set in a bar like atmosphere that feels very musky and dark. I liked it :)Anyway, the movie is AMAZING! (as you all might have guessed) There are plenty of musical numbers that shows off Rob Marshall's Exceptional Choreography and Direction in this film. He took his dream of making Chicago a film, and he did it, giving him enormous amounts of awards and critical acclaim. Very surprising to know that this was his first film, and with that amount of success, we know we'll see a lot more of him in the near future. Great Work Rob!!The Musical Numbers in this film are all too much and all too good, but the one's that stood out was: All That Jazz, Cell Block Tango, Mr. Cellophane, Roxie, We Both Reached For The Gun, When Your Good To Mama and Nowadays(Finale). Those numbers were cool, then again all of them were! I love the script with many quick back to back dialogue that is fast and right up to the point.Chicago Is a film that Is another hit at the big musical genre that is now coming back.

Her vocal tone is very strong and her dancing was right on the money! She's incredible. Renee Zellwegger's 'Roxie' performance and number is prestine, complete with mirrors and dancers behind her. She got those notes right up the there, with that moment being her's all the way. Queen Latifah gave her role of Miss. Mama Morton a bit hit, with her tough talking fast attitude performance that was a complete scene stealer. And finally, Richard Gere's tap-dancing interlude is a knockout with him doing all the tapping himself. I was left speechless.The Cinematography and Art Direction of this film is completely right out there. Though, maybe not as big as Moulin Rouge, (another musical that I love) It was completely accepted. The difference between Moulin Rouge and Chicago is that Moulin Rouge has a bigger scale that covered a lot of the Big Paris Landscape of 1899. While Chicago is more intimate and set in a bar like atmosphere that feels very musky and dark. I liked it :)Anyway, the movie is AMAZING! (as you all might have guessed) There are plenty of musical numbers that shows off Rob Marshall's Exceptional Choreography and Direction in this film. He took his dream of making Chicago a film, and he did it, giving him enormous amounts of awards and critical acclaim. Very surprising to know that this was his first film, and with that amount of success, we know we'll see a lot more of him in the near future. Great Work Rob!!The Musical Numbers in this film are all too much and all too good, but the one's that stood out was: All That Jazz, Cell Block Tango, Mr. Cellophane, Roxie, We Both Reached For The Gun, When Your Good To Mama and Nowadays(Finale). Those numbers were cool, then again all of them were! I love the script with many quick back to back dialogue that is fast and right up to the point.Chicago Is a film that Is another hit at the big musical genre that is now coming back. So check this movie out and you'll see what Chicago has up it's sleeve.

Big Show vs. John Cena (U.S. Title)Good way to start off the show.  Cena really got the crowd going.  Decent match between these two.  (7.5/10)2. Rob Van Dam & Booker T vs. Dudley Boys vs. Mark Jindrak & Garrioson Cade vs. La Resistance (World Tag Titles/Fatal Fourway)It is the better of the two tag title matches, but it is not that good.  It could have been, but it was a little too short.  Half of these guys are now on Smackdown.  It was nice of Vince to try to fit everyone into the show.  (7/10)3. Chris Jericho vs. ChristianThese two built up a great fued.  Great match.  Second best of the night.  There are some pretty sick spots in the match.  Jericho puts the ""Walls of Jericho"" on Christian and eventually keeps the hold all the way out onto the arena floor.  Trish Stratus makes an appearance.  Shocking ending.  (9/10)4. Evolution vs. Rock 'n' Sock Connection (Handicap Match)This match was put together to get The Rock and Flair into a match at this event.  Otherwise, it would have been Foley/Orton.  Good match.  The Rock and Flair put on great performances.  Surprising ending.  It comes out of nowhere.  (7.5/10)5. Torrie Wilson & Sable vs. Stacy Keibler & Miss Jackie (Evening Gown Match)Very disappointing.

Cruiserweight Open (Cruiserweight Title)Participants included Rey Mysterio, Chavo Guerrero, Ultimo Ultimo Dragon, Jamie Noble, Billy Kidman, Shannon Moore, Nunzio, Funaki, Akio, & Tajiri.  There are a lot of sick spots in this match, especially the Shooting Star Press by Billy Kidman off the middle of the top rope to the arena floor.  Unfortunatley, it is a short match and the wrestlers are not in the ring that long.  (8.5/10)7. Goldberg vs. Lesnar (Stone Cold Steve Austin as Guest Referee)This match was so hyped up and ended up being awful.  It was Lesnar and Goldber's last match in the WWE and one of Austin's last appearance.  The crowd made the match by ripping on Lesnar calling him a ""sellout"" for leaving for the NFL.  Horrible match.  (3/10)8. Rikishi & Scotty 2 Hotty vs. Basham Brothers vs. APA vs. World's Greatest Tag Team (WWE Tag Title/Fatal Fourway)Not a very good match. Just an attempt to get all these guys on the show.  (6/10)9. Victoria vs. Molly Holly (Women's Title/If Molly Loses, She Has To Shave Her Head)Not the best match, but good ending.  I don't want to tell you what happens.  (3/10)10. Kurt Angle vs. Eddie Guerrero (WWE Title)I thought this match was going to be one of the best in a while.  It was a little disappointing, but it was only that reason because Angle was hurt and he never revealed it until after the show.  It was still a good match.  The crowd was really into it.  The end is terrible.  (9/10)11. Kane vs. UndertakerThis match marked the return of the Undertaker as the Deadman.  Nobodby really cared about the match, they just wanted to see Taker.  Amazing entrance.  It is one of the most surreal moments you will ever see.  The crowd goes crazy.  Not the best match, but it is worth it for the entrance.  (6/10)12. Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H vs. Chris Benoit (World Heavyweight Title/Triple Threat)Great match.  Best match of the year so far.  They say it may be the best main event in WWE history.  Fantastic, fast paced match with a lot of emotions.  Great spots with HBK doing a Moonsault off the top turnbuckle to the arena floor.  Another sick spot with the double suplex on Benoit through the announce table.  Amazing ending, with a lot of near falls and high emotions.  Great energy in the match.  (9.5/10)As I said, this is a 3 disk set.  Some of the best extras is the special hosted by Flair which featured highlights of the top ten matches in 'Mania history as voted by the wrestlers.  Definately watch the movie of Wrestlemania 19, especially the Angle/Lesnar segment and The Rock/Austin segment.

Amazing entrance.  It is one of the most surreal moments you will ever see.  The crowd goes crazy.  Not the best match, but it is worth it for the entrance.  (6/10)12. Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H vs. Chris Benoit (World Heavyweight Title/Triple Threat)Great match.  Best match of the year so far.  They say it may be the best main event in WWE history.  Fantastic, fast paced match with a lot of emotions.  Great spots with HBK doing a Moonsault off the top turnbuckle to the arena floor.  Another sick spot with the double suplex on Benoit through the announce table.  Amazing ending, with a lot of near falls and high emotions.  Great energy in the match.  (9.5/10)As I said, this is a 3 disk set.  Some of the best extras is the special hosted by Flair which featured highlights of the top ten matches in 'Mania history as voted by the wrestlers.  Definately watch the movie of Wrestlemania 19, especially the Angle/Lesnar segment and The Rock/Austin segment.  They are both very, very emotional, especially Austin/The Rock segment.Definatley buy this DVD, it is worth it for the extras alone.Overall Rating:  9/10 ANSWERNOTFOUND",it was hyped up so much,"(74, 97)",1,0.2,False

In ten years people will be denouncing this X-Trilogy the same way they do the first Batman Saga. Unfortunately, there won't be a Chris Nolan and David Goyer or a Sam Raimi around to rectify the mistake this time.Ratner makes a total 360 from what little story Bryan Singer tried to build in his first two films. The convoluted plot involves a ""Cure"" for mutation, the Pheonix, rising from the ashes, and a war. Each of these stories would make for a great movie in and of themselves, but Ratner throws them in a blender and makes one big mess. There are too many stories, too many characters and no focus. But Storm needs more screen time, the studio needs Halle, and Ratner just uses CGI special effects to patch up the plotholes and totally derive from the course of the comics being adapted. In the first ten minutes Ratner uses the Phoenix to Kill off Cyclops and Professor X, characters crucial to the X-Saga. I guess this is so Storm can be leader and have more screen time. Thank you Miss Halle Berry. Someone in your entourage should advise you this old Broadway adage: THERE ARE NO SMALL PARTS ONLY SMALL ACTORS. It's not how much screen time you have, but what you do with it. Sadly she gives the same flat uninspired performance she does in every movie post Swordfish.Due to Halle's insecure need for more screen time, Ratner's incompetent directing and Fox's need to beat WB's Superman Returns at the box office, X3 falls completely apart over the course of 90 odd minutes. Ironically, these three political forces behind the camera sabotage the intriguing political stories in the movie. The movie strays way off course from the comic storylines it's adapted from and heads into Batman and Robin territory. In the comics, Jean who loved Cyclops so much she held back the evil Phoenix force and sacrificed her own life, Kills the man she loves with impunity. Wolverine loved Jean so much he couldn't bear to kill her. But in this movie he slaughters her with ease. But this change of story course from the comics is nothing compared to the numerous strays from the original two movies. Rogue who struggles and deals with her inability to touch others by finding another way to connect with them (emotionally), just cops out with a wonder drug. Iceman just decides to date Kitty Pryde because it's convenient to the plot. During the big battle sequence, Magneto abandons a cured Mystique, his loyal lieutenant of two movies. Six X-men take on an army of morlocks so storm can get her big battle sequence. And Magneto, the brilliant military strategist doesn't have enough sense to throw a force field around himself while Six X-men are shooting ""cure"" darts allover the place. Hey, he always keeps a magnetic force field around him in the comics, but in this movie he just decides not to. And when the war is all done, thousands of lives lost, billions in property damage, both sides shake hands and back to business as usual with a Don't ask, Don't tell policy. But these plot points don't matter. It's a necessary compromise so Storm gets more screen time.When you think about this movie it truly is the ""Wolverine and Storm"" of the X-Franchise a complete and unmitigated disaster.

It's a remarkably layered work about the importance of choice even in an emotional and political dictatorship and about the fictions and fantasies that sustain people through the worst circumstances. On the surface this appears to be little more than a more fantastic spin on The Spirit of the Beehive, sharing its post-Spanish Civil War setting as well as the broken family setting, but this is a far superior film in every way. Although marketed largely as a fantasy, its real power lies in the scenes set in the real world where Sergi Lopez's all too believable Fascist monster is mopping up the few remaining communist guerrillas in the hills while waiting for his sick wife to give birth to his son while her daughter from her first marriage tries to reassert her own identity rather than submit to the Captain's idea of family.The challenges of the mythical world are far less disturbing - or violent - than the real one, and it's all too easy to see why she wants to escape into the darkness of the labyrinth where at least the hope of something better exists. But then she's not the only one escaping into the imagination, as her mother sustains herself with a romanticised view of her meeting the captain that he has no interest in whatsoever. To him stories - even a part of his family history that has passed into local legend - exist only to be denied. Lopez's greatest sin isn't the pride that he admits to, or even that he is so pitiless, it's that he chooses to obey without question: the girl's small triumph is that she does not. And the triumphs in the film are generally small, quiet ones, where courage and fear go hand in hand, making the few acts of decency all the more important when they occur. There is one ""saved by the cavalry"" moment that at first doesn't convince but does prove to be there for a definite purpose that makes the ending all the more powerful.But while there's a lot going on underneath the surface of the film, it doesn't crush it with the weight of its ideas. It's directed with a visual assurance and, at times, playfulness that sweeps you along, sometimes with delight, sometimes with apprehension, but never simply for the sake of a nice shot or a neat special effect (most of which are incredibly well integrated for such a low budget feature). The performances are superb, with Lopez somehow managing to avoid turning his irredeemable character into a caricature: this is an evil without conscience that is all too recognisable. Javier Navarette's beautiful score is also adept at walking the fine line between magic and emotion without crossing the line into schmaltz.It's a remarkable film, the only new one that I saw last year that I'd genuinely say is one of the greatest of all time.

But the simple fact that it continues to move is more than you can say for most horror movies now-a-days (witness the hour it takes for anything to happen in the recent and dreadful remake of ""House of Wax""), but the film's pleasures are far more than its pace alone.With no self-indulgent over-length, or grandiose attempts at unnecesary plot and character development, ""High Tension"" is smart enough to follow the less-is-more storytelling path and realize the best and biggest scares are the most primative.  Hollywood, in all its bigger-is-better wisdom, never seems to learn that melting houses of wax and special effect spirits that attack from within the TV set will never be a substitute for, or as effectively frightning as, the idea that any of us can be brutally attacked at any moment, no matter what, if some one is fearless and dermined enough to do so.  No, I would not want to meet-up with Freddy or Jason, but I think my chances of avoiding them, at least in this lifetime, are pretty safe.  Some crazy guy breaking into my house and slaughtering my whole family, stalking the house, not leaving until he has made sure to horribly kill eveyone...  That is not only possible, but terrifying as hell.Obviously it is not a pleasant scenario, but ""High Tension"" is far from a pleasant film.  Truth be told, this movie is not for everyone.  Even horror fans may be put off.  This movie is not for the Freddy, Jason, ""Scream,"" or ""The Grudge,"" type of horror movie fan.  ""High Tension,"" is of a sicker, more brutal mold.  It is more akin to ""Texas Chainsaw Masacre,"" or ""Last House on the Left,"" although perhaps more gory and terrifying than either. (I know, ""Texas Chainsaw"" is famous for having very little actual blood, but everyone assuming there was a ton because of all the violent images and the movie was so terrifying and twisted; well ""High Tension"" is terrifying and twisted and DOES have a ton of blood.)  The violence and gore are severe and off-putting, which is a shame because the movie is such an effective suspense thriller beyond these moments that people who are looking for nerve-frying suspense of a classic nature, but can't stomach the carnage will be missing out.I have seen some reviews here that make light of the violence; many saying the film is laughable and stupid because of it.  I agree, it is over the top.  In a movie like ""Kill Bill"" or ""Evil Dead,"" for instance, a neck spewing blood after the head is severd gets a laugh because the tone of the film is satiracle.  ""High Tension"" is not playing its violence for laughs.  The senarios in which the violence is prestented here make it quite jarring.It is to the director's credit that ""High Tension"" so realistically creates an atmosphere of dread and desperateness (hence the 'tension').  There were a couple of times when I was pleasantly surprised to find what I thought I knew was going to happen didn't, or moments I thought were implausible or a leap of logic were explained away with later plot developments.The only thing I take issue with in this film is the big twist ending, which, looking at reviews here, seems to be what everyone is questioning.  The more I think about it, the more convinced I am that it doesn't work.  And it is also rather pointless.  In a film this straight-forward about its scares and old fashioned in its execution, it is surprising it felt the need to slap on a gotcha! ending.  It isn't a total abomination, though, and it hardly ruins all the suspence the movie provided for the previous 90 minutes.  I do wish filmmakers would learn, though, somethings don't need to be explained.  Some people are just crazy, sadistic and evil.  And if there must be an explination it doesn't have to be the most surprising thing that the writer can think of.  Often this means it is also the most outlandish and implausible thing he could think of as well.I still respect the ending on a small level though because at least it is trying to do something unique and clever.  Even though it ultimately fails, it is more than I can say for most movies of this type and gets an A for effort.I watched this movie right after the insipid ""House of Wax.""

There was nothing new or good about any moment of it.  Yet every few weekends Hollywood turns out a movie similar to it.  For a fraction of ""Wax's"" budget, with a fraction of its set pieces and none of its recognizable names, ""High Tension"" has 100 times its suspense.

Released in the early 1980's, it was bashed for being too derivative of Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window and Vertigo, plus being too sleazy at the  same time.  But in all honesty, I feel these aspects actually worked  together to make a truly tight, suspense-filled, edge of your seat  thriller.Jake Scully (Craig Wasson) is an actor who thinks he has it all  until he discovers he's been fired from his current work and his girlfriend  Carol (Barbara Crampton in a 5 second cameo) is sleeping with another man.  While looking for work, he encounters a guy named Sam Buchard (Gregg  Henry), another actor looking for work.  Sam, noticing how unhappy Jake is,  offers him the chance to sit a house that belongs to a friend of his.  Jake  gladly agrees for he has no home to go to.  After the first night in this  new home (it's actually a cool one too) he peeks through the telescope by  the window and sees the neighbor (Deborah Shelton) doing an erotic  striptease and masturbation dance.  This continuous observation leads  Scully to the world of pornography and a porn star named Holly Body  (Melanie Griffith), who may hold the answer to a crime he witnessed.It  was late around midnight when I watched this film and I was feeling a bit  sleepy but Body Double kept me wide awake and in suspense for all of its 2  hour running time.  Honestly, I never expected this movie to be that good.  Primarily, the most important aspect is if the movie delivers suspense, and  that it does.  Extremely well, too, might I add.  Brian De Palma can be  thanked for this.  Who can forget the tunnel scene, the venture into the  mall, the crime Scully witnesses, and the really creepy climax.  Brian De  Palma is truly one of the modern masters of suspense and should direct more  films like this.  What makes the suspense work is mainly because of the  fact that Wasson is alone in his investigation.  It creates a strong  foreboding atmosphere.  The great musical score doesn't hurt either.  Another asset are also some surprising and unpredictable plot twists that  occur.  I was surprised I didn't have it figured out toward a certain point  despite some good clues (and the fact that Wasson's character figures out  part of the mystery with the same amount of hints and clues as the viewer  has).  Watching the movie again is also fun just to re-examine the twists  and see how they worked out.Yes, the film does have a countless amount  of nudity in it but it's actually vital to the movie.  After all, how would  Wasson's character witness the crime if he didn't have the proper  motivation to peep on his neighbor.  It's an interesting look at voyeurism  and how it affects a person.  Yes, some moments are a bit sleazy such as  when Wasson is watching the X-rated channel.  But I can cut that part some  slack since it is actually quite humorous and it also leads to another plot  twist.Speaking of humor, that's another element that surprised me.  I  never expected it, but Body Double does have its humorous moments that  lighten up the tone a bit.  Some of its subtle while other parts are  actually quite hilarious (especially if you watch it with a friend),  especially De Palma's portrayal of X-rated films.  Don't think that the  humor hurts because it by no means meanders the suspense.  It just makes  the film more entertaining.Acting wise, Body Double is quite good.  Craig Wasson is terrific as the everyday guy who gets caught up in some  events beyond his control.  Melanie Griffith is also fine as Holly Body  though her character wasn't quite developed well enough.  Deborah Shelton  is okay as the neighbor Wasson constanly peeps on.  She actually develops  into a likeable character despite the fact that you know what her fate is  early on in the film.  Look for Dennis Franz as an independent horror film  director.In the erotic thriller genre, Body Double certainly ranks at  the top.  It feels genuinely suspenseful and it never manipulates the  viewer like so many other films of the genre do.  And as a sidenote, watch  the movie at midnight for the full effect, just like I did.  It'll make the  scenes at night with the Indian a whole lot creepier. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(4246, 4260)",1,0.0,False

The truth is what makes this movie such a gem is that it doesn't need to come out and smack you in the head with the type of dull, predicatable nonesense like most movies do these days.  It reminds me of older films; not in content or style, necessarily, but in its honest simplicity.  Why is it funny?  Not because its a constant joke machine, but because its just the opposite.  Does someone need to fall down, curse, get hurt, or otherwise make a fool out of themselves in order to be funny?  Well, to most people yes.  The reason why this movie is so funny is the same reason certain scenes in Casablanca are so funny, despite the seriousness of that film's subject: dialogue.  Because I haven't watched the movie lately, I'll leave it at that, and asure most of you that if you just relax and don't expect to see slapstick or stupid voices or people acting foolish, you might actually enjoy a movie that is funny in its simplicity.Another thing worth mentioning is Bill Murray's performance.  Many people, including critics who enjoyed the film, thought that Murray's Oscar nomination was unwarrented; that he was simply ""being"" Bill Murry.  That's like saying (to use the Casablanca reference again) that Bogey was just being himself and didn't have to act to be Rick Blaine.  I strongly disagree.  Murray's performance isn't in your face like most of his, or other actor's , performances.  True, he doesn't really have to ""become"" anyone, but he still has to act.  He has to be convincingly lonely, upset, tired, and frustrated, all the while being funny.  He doesn't just do it, it does it better than most actors could.  I'd hate to see Sean Penn try that, or even Jaime Fox a great actor, but when he does ""funny"" he can only seem to do a certain kind of in-your-face funny...that's not what this movie needed, and thank God thats not what it tried to do.Finally, the script.  Like its humor, its simply good, and charming.  All it asks of us is to give up two hours to watch to lonely Americans who find themselves in the same place, waiting for things to happen.  In the end, they become great friends and they decide to go out and make things happen. It doesn't need a caper of any kind. It doens't need explosions or any kind of love affair.  This is a character driven Comedic-Drama (or Dramatic-Comedy) and the chemistry between the Murray and Johansen is perfect.  I can't wait to see this movie again.

That's like saying (to use the Casablanca reference again) that Bogey was just being himself and didn't have to act to be Rick Blaine.  I strongly disagree.  Murray's performance isn't in your face like most of his, or other actor's , performances.  True, he doesn't really have to ""become"" anyone, but he still has to act.  He has to be convincingly lonely, upset, tired, and frustrated, all the while being funny.  He doesn't just do it, it does it better than most actors could.  I'd hate to see Sean Penn try that, or even Jaime Fox a great actor, but when he does ""funny"" he can only seem to do a certain kind of in-your-face funny...that's not what this movie needed, and thank God thats not what it tried to do.Finally, the script.  Like its humor, its simply good, and charming.  All it asks of us is to give up two hours to watch to lonely Americans who find themselves in the same place, waiting for things to happen.  In the end, they become great friends and they decide to go out and make things happen. It doesn't need a caper of any kind. It doens't need explosions or any kind of love affair.  This is a character driven Comedic-Drama (or Dramatic-Comedy) and the chemistry between the Murray and Johansen is perfect.  I can't wait to see this movie again.

It is much scarier than Psycho and The Exorcist, in my opinion, and the likes of Jason and Freddy pale in comparison to Michael Myers.  Its influence on the genre can hardly be overstated; countless slasher films have been released over the last two decades plus, wherein each filmmaker consciously or unconsciously has tried to duplicate the force and power of this 1978 masterpiece of terror and suspense.  It is this movie's genre-defining influence that earns it first place in my rankings.Is the movie scary?  Yes, emphatically so.  All these years later, with audiences having a number of other slasher films under their belt, Halloween may not seem as frightening as it had to have been when it was released, but it is deliciously scary nonetheless.  The groundbreaking point of view shots Cameron employs only adds to the incredible suspense of the story.  Watching this movie alone in a dark room is probably a pretty bad idea, as is going to bed immediately afterwards.  Nick Castle's portrayal of Michael is brilliantly subtle, and the photography and soundtrack are superb.  The image of the featureless, pasty-white mask hovering above a dark set of clothes is unnerving, and the early sightings of him in Haddenfield are amazingly effective-even when you know he is there, it is sometimes difficult to spot him.  One of the best scenes later on has Michael creeping out of a darkened room; it is as if the mask just somehow emerges out of nowhere from the shadows.  Even Michael's walk and method of suddenly sitting straight up out of a prone position are amazingly impactful.  He really does seem to represent true evil, a force of nature that keeps coming and coming all the time yet is entirely human.  He is everywhere and nowhere.  The musical score is beyond outstanding; the famous Halloween theme is immediately recognizable whenever you hear it, taking you directly back to Haddonfield.  Halloween was the first true horror movie I ever watched.  I was probably around twelve at the time, and I decided I was going to watch my first horror film the proper way-in the dark, late at night.  I am embarrassed to say that I never even made it through the opening credits.  That jack o'lantern and incredibly creepy music scared the daylights out of me.While Michael is horror's most terrifying killer, Halloween would not have seen nearly as much success had it not been for Donald Pleasance's character Dr. Loomis.  Loomis' brilliant acting and forceful presence gives Halloween something its imitators don't have, and his almost philosophical musings on Michael's innate evil give this killer a depth that other slasher villains just don't possess.  Jamie Lee Curtis, of course, was also fabulous in this, her first movie role.  No other scream queen can boast of such advanced acting skills.  I didn't think the acting jobs of the other teenagers were very good, but those characters were in the movie for one reason only, and it wasn't to steal the show.The extra features on the limited edition release are pretty good.  The ""Halloween Unmasked"" featurette from 1998 delivers interviews with cast and creators (including an unmasked Nick Castle, who looks more like a professor than a ""killer"").  The extras also include several scenes shot in 1982 and added to the television version of the movie.  The first of these provides more detail about Michael's original transfer to a minimum security institution and Dr. Loomis' attempts to prevent it from taking place.  The second one is a great scene featuring Loomis telling the teenaged, pseudo-comatose Michael that he may have fooled the hospital administrators but he hasn't fooled him.  The third offers a bit of unnecessary data on Michael's motivations.  The fourth scene features some extended dialogue between the movie's three teenaged girls and is forgettable at best.  What I found most interesting was the story of Halloween's origins.  Many have forgotten or never even knew how much of a surprise hit this movie was in 1978.  It was filmed over the course of just three weeks with a total budget of little more than three hundred thousand dollars.  Donald Pleasance filmed all of his scenes in a mere five days.  The history of Halloween is really remarkable, especially when you consider the importance and influence of this movie on the genre.  John Carpenter managed to bring together everything a horror film needs to succeed, and the entire industry has been trying to match his efforts without complete success ever since.

But, after about half and hour or so, this movie really got going. The story revolves around Jonah Ben-Hur, a Jewish prince who is arrested for attempting to murder a roman governor (Which was untrue. It was a mere accident) and forced into slavery. Ben-Hur is portrayed in an Academy Award winning performance by Charlton Heston. Some critics have complained in the years following the film's release that Heston is wooden in his role. While his performance isn't brilliant and does have some poor moments, he is excellent nonetheless. The rest of the cast is also good. The sets, cinematography and special effects are also excellent, which is probably why they won among the film's Eleven Academy Awards, a tally that wouldn't be equaled until 1997's Titanic.I though at first that the opening scene of the film (The birth of Jesus Christ) had nothing to do with the movie. But Jesus was a main part in Ben-Hur's life, at least in his Hollywood life. He encouraged him to continue moving on when Jonah was a slave and also baptized him. When Jesus was dying at the cross, he performed one last miracle on the Hur family by curing Jonah's mother and sister of leprosy.There is in this movie what is among the ten most celebrated action scenes in motion pictures: The chariot race. After more than forty years, the sequence has not lost its original excitement and is still inspiring directors today (See the pod race in Star Wars Episode One). What makes it so good is the way it was filmed. Sometimes, the camera angle makes it look as if we are spectators at the race. In other shots, we are chasing the chariots or even feel as though we are sitting in the driver's chair. The fact it was filmed in the 1950's before such a scene could be computer generated or filmed in front of a blue screen makes us appreciate it more because of the risks the producers took in filming it. Would such a scene be as great and realistic if filmed today?The presentation on the DVD is Widescreen Anamorphic. The transfer is excellent with hardly any nicks or scratches. The extras are even more excellent. There is a superb documentary about the making of Ben-Hur, covering the book, stage productions, the 1907 short, the 1926 silent movies and of course the much celebrated 1959 movie. This documentary also shows revealing look at the making of the movie, exposing secrets of some of the special effects (One interesting tidbit: William Wyler, who directed the 1959 Ben-Hur, was an assistant director on the 1926 silent version).  There are also two theatrical trailers, screen tests and commentary from star Charlton Heston. The only major complaint I have is how you have to turn the disc over during the playing of the movie after the intermission to watch the rest of it. Taking the disc out of the box is also difficult as well.Three-hour epics such as Ben-Hur are what can be considered an acquired taste. They are long and slow at times and often with unnecessary scenes. But this doesn't mean they aren't worth watching. If you want to learn about the Roman Empire or if you just feel like watching a good movie, Ben-Hur is highly recommended. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3338, 3352)",1,0.0,False

The two films are very similar in that they are both ghost stories...very Japanese ghost stories. In fact, I kind of wish I had seen The Grudge before I saw The Ring because the Grudge (and the DVD interviews with Sam Raimi and Takashi Shimizu) explains why both films were so creepy and disturbing.At the heart of both film's effectiveness is the difference between Western and Eastern ghost tales. In the West, there is almost always some type of redemption: the wicked are punished, the innocent are damaged but wiser, and the ghost is at peace. In Eastern stories, ghosts (at least those of a person who died confused and angry) are always hungry for revenge and can never be at peace.

Because Sam Raimi (""Evil Dead"" and ""Spiderman"") isn't exactly the most understated of filmakers, I imagine the quietness and pacing of the film was a deliberate decision.

The two films are very similar in that they are both ghost stories...very Japanese ghost stories. In fact, I kind of wish I had seen The Grudge before I saw The Ring because the Grudge (and the DVD interviews with Sam Raimi and Takashi Shimizu) explains why both films were so creepy and disturbing.At the heart of both film's effectiveness is the difference between Western and Eastern ghost tales. In the West, there is almost always some type of redemption: the wicked are punished, the innocent are damaged but wiser, and the ghost is at peace. In Eastern stories, ghosts (at least those of a person who died confused and angry) are always hungry for revenge and can never be at peace.

That point of intersection is the mother/son relationship between Sara Goldfarb, a lonely widow living in a rundown tenement in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, and her son, Harry, a ne'er do well loser hooked up with a couple of junkies, one of whom is his girlfriend, Marion.  Harry and his friends are well on their way to becoming addicts when the movie opens and, until the supply suddenly peters out, the three of them are having the time of their lives.  Unfortunately, once they hit hard times, all hell breaks loose and their lives quickly become a downward spiral into withdrawal, crime, prostitution, illness and prison.  This is the more conventional side of the screenplay.  Where the film really charts new territory is in the concomitant half which is focused on Sara, a well meaning woman whose obsession to lose a few pounds results in her becoming addicted to doctor-prescribed amphetamines.  For Sara, this leads to an eventual descent into disorientation, hallucinatory episodes and, eventually, madness.Some may find Aronosky's blunt directorial style to be overemphatic, hammer-like and off-putting.  To approximate the feeling of dislocation caused by the various drugs, the director employs a wide variety of cinematic techniques at his disposal: sped up motion, jarring quick cuts, visual distortion etc.  Though it can become a bit much at time, one has to admire the effort to bring the viewer as much into the minds of the characters as is conceivably possible using the resources of filmmaking.  The film is both unsparing and unflinching in showing the physical and psychological damage drugs can cause.  The last section of the film, though it could be accused of lacking subtlety, nevertheless becomes a harrowing journey into a world filled with confusion, despair and pain.Burstyn makes Sara a compelling and sympathetic figure from the very start.  Alone in her drab room, she watches T.V. all day, dreaming of the time when she will matter to someone again.  Burstyn does a brilliant job in showing how, thanks to her increasing addiction, Sara slowly loses her grip on reality and slips over into schizophrenia and madness.  And though we are appalled by the anti-social behavior both of her son, Henry, and of his cronies, we come to see even them in three-dimensional terms, especially through Harry's obvious love of his mother and the tenderness that develops in Harry and Marian's relationship.  The revelatory moment occurs when Harry realizes that his mother is also addicted to drugs, yet how hollow his words sound as he admonishes her to kick her habit.  Even he can do little but break down in tears during the cab ride home and return to his own self-absorbed drug addicted life.  (This is the last time we ever see them together as their lives diverge to follow their own paths towards mutual self-destruction).Special note should be taken of Clint Mansell's subtle and haunting musical score, which brings an air of melancholy uneasiness to this strange world of the drug-addicted mind.Brilliantly acted and superbly directed, ""Requiem For a Dream,"" though not always easy to watch, reveals uncompromising truths that cannot be ignored.

I hope to change that someday, because it is a city full of history, and I personally have a healthy appreciation for history and the way in which it shapes the world in which we live and the people who we become.Before I confuse you, allow me to point out that Silver Linings Playbook is not a movie about history. But it is a movie set in Philadelphia. And while I've never been there, I have developed a healthy hatred for it. You may say that hatred is baseless, but I say you've never met someone from Philly. Or you're from Philly and lack proper perspective. Admittedly, nearly all of my interaction with Philadelphia and its residents has, to this point in my life, revolved around sports. But Philadelphia athletes do things like electrocute dogs (I will kindly ignore you as you point out he was an Atlanta athlete while he was electrocuting dogs, because we had the benefit of ignorance), and Philadelphia fans are widely acknowledged to be the worst in sports (unless you're from Philly... then they're awesome).You may be wondering why I should be suggesting that you not see a movie because it is set in a city you may or may not hate based almost solely on its relationship with sports. My response would be that Philly is a sports city, and it is defined in major part by its relationship with its sports. Accordingly, this movie, through its characterizations, very much relates to Philadelphia's relationships with its sports. So if you are like me and have a healthy distaste for Philadelphia, its people, or its sports, you may want to avoid watching this.Why you should see it:I said that Silver Linings isn't a movie about history, and that's true. Nor is it explicitly about Philadelphia. But it is a story about people who are the product of Philadelphia's history, and because of that, it couldn't be set anywhere else. Other films have settings that are merely the time and place in which the plot unfolds, but this is a plot that couldn't exist outside of its setting. The result is a story that is unique and compelling to me and yet all too familiar to many Philadelphians.Bradley Cooper has seemingly made a career of playing jerks in his movies, and that actually hasn't changed here. Maybe that's because he's a jerk in real life (you'll never guess the city from which he hails... Philadelphia!). Anyway, in this movie it's almost as if his jerk personality is put back in its natural environment, and the result is a jerk you can pull for. I don't necessarily think he had to stretch his acting abilities all that far to appear in this, but he still does a fantastic job of portraying a man who is wholly unlike me but still completely relatable.You can still get in on the ground floor of Jennifer Lawrence appreciation, since she's only been around for two years. But in those two years, she has two deserved best actress nominations (one of them here) and two roles in fan-pleasing box office genre movies. If she isn't on the fast track to becoming one of Hollywood's (much needed) leading ladies, I just don't know what to say. In Silver Linings, she plays a sort of mirror to Bradley's character, and likewise nails the jerk-for-whom-you-wish-good-things part (and yet she's from Kentucky... go figure).Aside from the two main characters, there are still a few other noteworthy members of the cast. It appears as though this was an opportunity jumped on by Robert DeNiro to get back to quality acting, and I have to say that I've never before been genuinely entertained by Chris Tucker until now. I won't say that they offer any sort of counterbalance or opposition to the off-kilter nature of Cooper or Lawrence, because they don't. Everyone in this film is off his or her rocker at least a little bit, and that's the point.In short:I spent the entirety of Silver Linings torn between wanting to know what happens next and still not wanting to see what happens next. The unorthodoxy of the two leads draws me in in a way that I haven't experienced in a while, and I appreciate the opportunity to care about such flawed individuals. I don't believe Cooper had to reach to play his character, but that doesn't diminish his portrayal at all, and Lawrence keeps step with him the entire time. In the end, I think nothing more than spite for the city of Philly made me leave the rating for this one at an 8 out of 10 instead of more, but I still recommend it for anyone who can enjoy a completely unusual romantic comedy. At least I think that's what it is... I don't know what other category it would fit into.Exceptions to the recommendation:- anyone with a jealous wife or girlfriend who might make assumptions about why you're watching Jennifer Lawrence in this movie;- anyone with a jealous husband or boyfriend who might make assumptions about why you're watching Bradley Cooper in this movie;- if you think dancing scenes are stupid and contrived when added into romantic comedies;- people who would like to go on thinking that they're the ones with problems;- anyone who can't handle awkwardness fueled by inappropriate comments;- if you really do have a seething hatred for the City of Brotherly Love.

It's just too bad that Mr. Howard felt the need to manipulate us, tell us what to feel and think, and tug at the emotional heartstrings intentionally, instead of letting the story itself do that for us.The story of a person's life, told truthfully and accurately, without manipulation, is *far* more compelling than any fictional story we could think to invent, and certainly far more interesting than taking a person's story and adding in some fictional components to make it ""sell"" to the movie public. Sorry, but the movie public just ends up feeling abused. Nash's story could be told on grainy black and white film, with the same cast, but with no special effects, and audience would be riveted, because Nash's story *itself* is riveting.Please stop adding fiction to real-life stories; please stop manipulating the viewers, Mr. Howard.On the DVD itself: 3 or 4 stars for the DVD. Lots and lots of extras, but not of much interest. The transfer of the movie onto the DVD was done *beautifully*. This is an excellent transfer.This is one for renting, not owning.

Whenever a trailer has difficulty in explaining the plot, I lower my expectations.  ""When someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage, a curse is born"" seems a bit awkward.  The ""grip"" of a ""powerful"" rage?  Not a really bad rage?  What exactly is a rage's grip anyway?This challenge, the failure to explain exactly the plot behind the horror, saps the terror from the movie.  I should warn readers now that I'm going to make a lot of comparisons to The Ring, a movie that scared the living crap out of me, because the two have a lot of similarities. We are venturing into Spoilerland.So let's talk about similarities.  Although The Grudge is most certainly not a copy of The Ring, there are enough similarities to make comparisons inevitable. Besides the simplistic titles (""The NOUN, a new Japanese horror, coming to a theater near you!""), both films feature crawling girls with long hair covering their faces, a viral curse, and ghosts that defy the traditional boundary of staying in their respective haunted houses.  The climax is even similar: both heroines struggle to save the male love interest before he too becomes infected.The primary difference between the two films is style. Where The Ring creates a set of rules and then systematically breaks them (or, depending on your perspective, doesn't break them at all but stops reminding you about them), The Grudge isn't encumbered by such rules, to its detriment.  This makes the movie hard to follow. In addition, the scenes unfold out of order, explaining what happened to each victim and thereby illustrating the original murder, Memento style.Here's what I was able to piece together from the deleted scenes: Kayako (Takako Fuji) and Takeo (Takashi Matsuyama) Saeki move into a new home with their son, Toshio (Yuya Ozeki) and his pet cat.  While attending school, Kayako becomes infatuated with Peter Kirk (Bill Pullman), her professor.  When Takeo discovers her many love notes to the professor, he goes on a berserk rage, murdering Kayako, Toshio, and the cat. Then he kills himself.The curse kicks in pretty quickly after that.  Peter discovers something is wrong and visits the house, only to be infected by the curse, which eventually causes him to throw himself off a rooftop.Three years later, Karen Davis (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and her pretty-boy boyfriend Doug (Jason Behr) move to Japan as part of an exchange program.  Karen is a healthcare worker who specializes in taking care of the elderly.  A house now inhabited by the Williams family, including Matthew (William Mapother), his wife Jennifer (Clea DuVall), and Matthew's elderly mother Emma (Grace Zabriskie).  When the regular healthcare worker doesn't show up for work one day, Karen is called in to pick up the slack. She's got a new assignment that just happens to be in that Saeki house...The beauty of The Ring was the development of its characters.  It established people who, when faced with spreading evil or the death of their family, gladly chose the greater evil.  It dove into the complicated relationship between two parents in a modern age who don't know how to be adults, much less parents.  And it peeled away at the voyeuristic core in every one of us, who engages in peeping merely by sitting in a movie theater or watching television...and then punished us for it.The Grudge is not nearly so high-minded. The curse spreads quickly; so quickly, in fact, that I had a vision of the Japanese National Guard being finally called in to stop the madness when two hundred people are found dead at the Sakei house.  Ghosts change form, appear on camera, make weird cat noises, show up seemingly at random, and kill some people quickly but take longer to murder others.I've never been a fan of Gellar, and her performance didn't change my mind. Karen has no spark with Doug on screen, and their relationship is barely fleshed out.  Culture shock is briefly explored in Jennifer's struggle with understanding the Japanese world, but not enough to make us really feel her pain.  Not even Jennifer's relationship with Matthew has any real depth. And Gellar seems way too old to be a giddy exchange student.The only characters that are actually fleshed out are the members of the Sakei family.  The deleted scenes make it clear that we're not witnessing one traditional American ghost haunting, but a ghost house of sorts, which utilizes all four bodies (yes, even the cat), to kill its victims.  And we come to realize that they are all reenacting their deaths over and over, from the croak of Kayako's severed vocal chords to the shriek of Toshio's poor cat.  Unfortunately, critical plot points connecting the first murders with the subsequent deaths were cut, seriously undermining the shuffled scenes. Half the fun is piecing together why the curse took place and connecting the murders to the original event; when you can't make those connections, the film just becomes incoherent.And that's the problem.  With a ghost that can invade your office building, your home, or your bed, we lose all hope that the heroine can even defeat it.  The final solution, that the house must be burned to the ground, doesn't seem like a solution at all.  When the ghost(s) can look like people you know and call you on your cell phone, the evil seems to have such power that we never believe the heroine has a realistic chance of surviving.The movie is still creepy.  After all, Sam Raimi executive produced. The film is beautifully shot with minimal special effects.  The same creepy-crawly stumbling that made Samara so horrifying is in evidence here.  The Grudge also makes use of a multitude of horrible sounds, including the aforementioned caterwauling and death-rattling.Unfortunately, that's not enough to really make The Grudge a scary movie for Western audiences.

(What about Season Seven, you ask? Well, let's just leave it standing alone in the corner, looking at its shoes and crying because no one wants to hang with it (and can you blame them?).""Consolidation"" has a compromised tone to it, but that's not what I mean. Seasons Three and Four are excellent.  It's not a question of quality, which on Buffy was almost always high, but tone-- these are more playful seasons than those that precede and follow, and there's a wittiness to the way in which series creator/auteur Joss Whedon puts his characters through their paces. Season Three, in particular-- from ""Band Candy"" and ""Homecoming"" through  ""The Zeppo"" and the mayor's speech in ""Graduation Day""-- is full of humor.The brightness extends to the show's look-- Buffy switches from darker 16mm stock to 35mm, giving the show a brighter look. We see more of Sunnydale, here too--  coffee shops, town streets, and the glowing green sign of the Sunnydale cinema. Darkness doesn't disappear-- the show, particularly in the first half of the season, is forced to grapple with the events of the season that preceeded it-- but this is certainly Buffy's most optimistic season, and that optimism may account for its popularity with fans.  Season Three was the highest-rated of any Buffy year in the Nielsens, and this year and the next were the height of the show's media buzz.It speaks volumes about how Buffy juggles tones that I can write the above with absolute conviction and then turn around and tell you that the show grapples, in its first four episodes alone, with teen suicide, homelessness, broken families, the dark underbelly of fundamentalism, the return of a murderer, the arrival of a rival slayer, and a mayor who has cheerfully sold his soul to demonic forces.  To say nothing of such Buffy staples as the horror of high school, the mendacity of teenage cliques and the glorious pain of doomed love.So, ok, ""optimism"" and ""wit"" are relative terms.  There are moments in Season Three that are heartbreaking, times when characters must grapple with fear, loss, betrayal and disappointment.  The genius of Joss Whedon and his writers is that they give the fans exactly what they want...exactly when they *don't* want it.  Whedon is not a moralist (a type that almost always comes in for criticism and mockery on his shows), but his work does have an ethics to it-- there are consequences to actions, and every moment, good or bad, always contains an element of its opposite. Ambiguity reigns in the BuffyVerse, and Season Three, for all its humor, contains moments when even the most seemingly ""innocent"" of Buffy folk are held up for sympathetic scrutiny.Still, moreso than any other season, Season Three ultimately grants its characters a level of grace and closure unusual for this normally open-ended show.  Even the ""villains"" are more sympathetic than usual, and far more out in the open.  It normally takes the show several eps to establish what fans refer to as ""the big bad"" for the year, but here, in keeping with the lighter, open tone, it's established early on (by the third episode) that the season's uber-villain is the Mayor, a deceptively young-looking family man who was granted eternal life and great power by demonic forces.  The mayor is my favorite of all of the program's ""big bads,"" a testament both to the ability of the writers to throw curve-balls at their audience and to the great humor and geniality that Harry Groener brings to the role.  Whether he's expounding on the genius of the FAMILY CIRCUS  (""That PJ!"") or telling hard truths to Buffy and Angel, Groener always makes his villainy charming, almost incidental-- you *like* him, and he, like every one on the show, is granted moments of humanity and understanding rare in television characterizations (incidentally, it's been mentioned in interviews that the Mayor is based on series writer/producer (and later ANGEL co-creator) David Greenwalt, and once you know this, it is impossible to watch one of the many greenwalt interviews on the Buffy/Angel sets without laughing).I don't want to give away any plot twists, but I do want to make brief mention of: the arrival of Wesley-Windam Price, a character who will become more important in the program's spinoff, ANGEL;  the real-world arrival to the show of writer Jane Espenson, who will write more great Buffy eps over the remaining seasons than anyone aside from Joss Whedon; the wonderfully expanded role of Buffy's mom, played by the fabulous Kristine Sutherland, who has more good moments here than in any other year; the rough charm and deep passion Eliza Dushku brings to Faith, the rival vamp slayer; and the usual outstanding work of series regulars Sarah Michelle Gellar, Charisma Carpenter, David Boreanez, Seth Green, Nicholas Brendan, Alyson Hannigan, and the always amazing Anthony Stewart Head.The other way to divide the history of the show, of course, is between high school and post-high school seasons.  Season Three marks the dividing line between these two periods, and had the show ended here, it would have been logical and fulfilling, if also deeply disappointing.  The remaining seasons of Buffy find the characters shifting, growing, regressing, and hitting new depths (and the show, new heights).

(What about Season Seven, you ask? Well, let's just leave it standing alone in the corner, looking at its shoes and crying because no one wants to hang with it (and can you blame them?).""Consolidation"" has a compromised tone to it, but that's not what I mean. Seasons Three and Four are excellent.  It's not a question of quality, which on Buffy was almost always high, but tone-- these are more playful seasons than those that precede and follow, and there's a wittiness to the way in which series creator/auteur Joss Whedon puts his characters through their paces. Season Three, in particular-- from ""Band Candy"" and ""Homecoming"" through  ""The Zeppo"" and the mayor's speech in ""Graduation Day""-- is full of humor.The brightness extends to the show's look-- Buffy switches from darker 16mm stock to 35mm, giving the show a brighter look. We see more of Sunnydale, here too--  coffee shops, town streets, and the glowing green sign of the Sunnydale cinema. Darkness doesn't disappear-- the show, particularly in the first half of the season, is forced to grapple with the events of the season that preceeded it-- but this is certainly Buffy's most optimistic season, and that optimism may account for its popularity with fans.  Season Three was the highest-rated of any Buffy year in the Nielsens, and this year and the next were the height of the show's media buzz.It speaks volumes about how Buffy juggles tones that I can write the above with absolute conviction and then turn around and tell you that the show grapples, in its first four episodes alone, with teen suicide, homelessness, broken families, the dark underbelly of fundamentalism, the return of a murderer, the arrival of a rival slayer, and a mayor who has cheerfully sold his soul to demonic forces.  To say nothing of such Buffy staples as the horror of high school, the mendacity of teenage cliques and the glorious pain of doomed love.So, ok, ""optimism"" and ""wit"" are relative terms.  There are moments in Season Three that are heartbreaking, times when characters must grapple with fear, loss, betrayal and disappointment.  The genius of Joss Whedon and his writers is that they give the fans exactly what they want...exactly when they *don't* want it.  Whedon is not a moralist (a type that almost always comes in for criticism and mockery on his shows), but his work does have an ethics to it-- there are consequences to actions, and every moment, good or bad, always contains an element of its opposite. Ambiguity reigns in the BuffyVerse, and Season Three, for all its humor, contains moments when even the most seemingly ""innocent"" of Buffy folk are held up for sympathetic scrutiny.Still, moreso than any other season, Season Three ultimately grants its characters a level of grace and closure unusual for this normally open-ended show.  Even the ""villains"" are more sympathetic than usual, and far more out in the open.  It normally takes the show several eps to establish what fans refer to as ""the big bad"" for the year, but here, in keeping with the lighter, open tone, it's established early on (by the third episode) that the season's uber-villain is the Mayor, a deceptively young-looking family man who was granted eternal life and great power by demonic forces.  The mayor is my favorite of all of the program's ""big bads,"" a testament both to the ability of the writers to throw curve-balls at their audience and to the great humor and geniality that Harry Groener brings to the role.  Whether he's expounding on the genius of the FAMILY CIRCUS  (""That PJ!"") or telling hard truths to Buffy and Angel, Groener always makes his villainy charming, almost incidental-- you *like* him, and he, like every one on the show, is granted moments of humanity and understanding rare in television characterizations (incidentally, it's been mentioned in interviews that the Mayor is based on series writer/producer (and later ANGEL co-creator) David Greenwalt, and once you know this, it is impossible to watch one of the many greenwalt interviews on the Buffy/Angel sets without laughing).I don't want to give away any plot twists, but I do want to make brief mention of: the arrival of Wesley-Windam Price, a character who will become more important in the program's spinoff, ANGEL;  the real-world arrival to the show of writer Jane Espenson, who will write more great Buffy eps over the remaining seasons than anyone aside from Joss Whedon; the wonderfully expanded role of Buffy's mom, played by the fabulous Kristine Sutherland, who has more good moments here than in any other year; the rough charm and deep passion Eliza Dushku brings to Faith, the rival vamp slayer; and the usual outstanding work of series regulars Sarah Michelle Gellar, Charisma Carpenter, David Boreanez, Seth Green, Nicholas Brendan, Alyson Hannigan, and the always amazing Anthony Stewart Head.The other way to divide the history of the show, of course, is between high school and post-high school seasons.  Season Three marks the dividing line between these two periods, and had the show ended here, it would have been logical and fulfilling, if also deeply disappointing.  The remaining seasons of Buffy find the characters shifting, growing, regressing, and hitting new depths (and the show, new heights). Challenges lay ahead, for both characters and fans, but that was good-- after all, no one wants to be happy *all* the time. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(5974, 5988)",1,0.0,False

Well, him and his master Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) are assigned to protect former queen turned senator Padme (Natalie Portman) after ten years apart from an assassin. This job eventually leads to Obi-Wan being separated from Anakin while he investigates the assassin who happens to be involved with a cloning conspiracy and this later leads him to a renegade Jedi master played by Christopher Lee. Guess what? Anakin still has the hots for Padme and whilst Obi-Wan is away Anakin would like nothing better than to strip her naked and get her in the sack.

The answer is that it got green lit because of George Lucas's success with the original trilogy and the fact that he backed the film up with his own money and what not. This leads to another question: ""How could anyone have thought that this was a good script?"" The answer is no one, but they signed on to it anyway because they all knew they'd get paychecks and they knew people would come out in droves to see it and make it a hit regardless of whether it's good or not. I remember watching ""Phantom Menace"" and coming away feeling like ""What happened? HOW could this have happened?""How many things are wrong with this film? Well, I think we all agree that the title sucks so I won't dwell on that for too long. One of the big things working against this movie is the fact that the character relationships, which should be the meat of the film, are never fully defined and/or explored (a similar problem afflicted 2003's ""Daredevil""). George Lucas keeps TELLING us a bunch of things in interviews, but he doesn't depict them particularly well. He TOLD us that Anakin and Obi-Wan were good friends and he TOLD us that Anakin and Padme fall in love, but the manner in which he plays it out is very forced, ersatz and unbelievable. At this point, Anakin's relationship with Obi-Wan is starting to deteriorate; this is a good thing, but it makes very little sense as depicted because the relationship between Anakin and Obi-Wan, which should have been the main focus of ""Menace"", was never explored or established in PM, thanks to the continuity error of Liam Neeson's Qui-Gon Jinn character. Ultimately what we're left with is the impression that these two never liked each other much; the only hint of friendship we get is when Obi-Wan tries to comfort Anakin about his nightmares of his mother's death.Which leads to one of the biggest problems with the film - Anakin's mother. It was hard enough to believe that Anakin actually LEFT his mom in PM, but it's even harder to believe that ten years have passed and Anakin never bothered to go back and rescue her from Tatioone. Seeing as how the Jedi Knights are supposed to be great heroes and humanitarians, it's hard to believe that the Jedi - least of all Obi-Wan Kenobi - would not allow Anakin to go back for his mom, especially when you consider how much easier it would have made training him. Or the fact that Padme was rich from being an ""elected queen"" (I can't stand that crap) and could very easily have paid the money to free the Skywalker mother. And when he's too late to save her, Anakin goes on a killing spree against the Sand People; okay, they beat his mom to a pulp, I admit that will p*** a guy off, but the circumstances surrounding it simply make no sense, dramatically or logistically.Don't forget the poorly illustrated relationship between Anakin and the future Emperor either (Ian McDiarmid, now playing the young version of his villain from ""Return of the Jedi"").The much hyped love story is also unpleasant, despite a nicely done love theme by John Williams. The majority of it is Anakin leering at Padme like some kind of lusty, sex starved stalker who can't wait to tear all her clothes off and rape the hell out of her and she clearly doesn't like it. Then again, I guess it's hard NOT to leer at a girl like Natalie Portman when everything she wears is either strapless, backless, or gutless. For someone who's a proponent of anti-sleaze in films, Natalie goes out on quite a limb here, even donning black leather (it's like porn for Star Wars fans). The age difference is also an annoying little factor, thus spawning the question of what the older and considerably more mature Padme sees in the future Darth Vader. Bad boy nothing, he continually goes flying off the handle for no apparent reason, even by growing pains standards, and then he goes on the aforementioned killing spree and instead of horrifying her and revolting her it only seems to get her to fall in love with him. I'm all for tragic, doomed love affairs but the truth is that there's no real reason for these two to get together except that Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia need a mom. And what was up with the line about hating sand?Politics are not particularly well done either. Having Jar Jar Binks back and having him play a key role in the rise of the Empire - convincing the senate to okay the creation of the Clone Army thus starting the Clone Wars mentioned in the original film - is quite insulting.The acting is a mixed bag at best. Ewan McGregor manages to make the young Obi-Wan (who now looks like Jesus Christ) a somewhat poetic and likable figure, whilst Samuel L. Jackson is a capable Jedi and Christopher Lee does his usual larger than life villain. Natalie Portman, as cute as she may be, can't make heads nor tails of her Padme, always talking in a flat, high pitched voice that makes her sound too much like a girl and not enough like a woman. Hayden Christensen tries hard but he's either too stiff as Anakin or he's just annoying and, ultimately, he comes off as a sadistic creep. It's not like Al Pacino in the Godfather, where his character was a smart, honorable, well intentioned man who was blind-sided by his own ruthless ambitions. Then again, Christensen doesn't really have much to work with, does he?There are a few neat sequences - the hover chase after Jango Fett, the gladiator arena pitting Obi-Wan, Anakin and Padme against a bunch of beasts, the sight of a bunch of Jedi lighting up their light sabers (don't miss the Jedi who looks like a cone head and the green Jedi with the dread locks), and of course, Yoda's fight with Christopher Lee (but I could have done without the Bruce Lee crowing). However, I have a hard time believing that all these Force powered Jedi could get killed by mindless robots.Kind of makes you wonder how often George Lucas ventures out from his ranch.

He TOLD us that Anakin and Obi-Wan were good friends and he TOLD us that Anakin and Padme fall in love, but the manner in which he plays it out is very forced, ersatz and unbelievable. At this point, Anakin's relationship with Obi-Wan is starting to deteriorate; this is a good thing, but it makes very little sense as depicted because the relationship between Anakin and Obi-Wan, which should have been the main focus of ""Menace"", was never explored or established in PM, thanks to the continuity error of Liam Neeson's Qui-Gon Jinn character. Ultimately what we're left with is the impression that these two never liked each other much; the only hint of friendship we get is when Obi-Wan tries to comfort Anakin about his nightmares of his mother's death.Which leads to one of the biggest problems with the film - Anakin's mother. It was hard enough to believe that Anakin actually LEFT his mom in PM, but it's even harder to believe that ten years have passed and Anakin never bothered to go back and rescue her from Tatioone. Seeing as how the Jedi Knights are supposed to be great heroes and humanitarians, it's hard to believe that the Jedi - least of all Obi-Wan Kenobi - would not allow Anakin to go back for his mom, especially when you consider how much easier it would have made training him. Or the fact that Padme was rich from being an ""elected queen"" (I can't stand that crap) and could very easily have paid the money to free the Skywalker mother. And when he's too late to save her, Anakin goes on a killing spree against the Sand People; okay, they beat his mom to a pulp, I admit that will p*** a guy off, but the circumstances surrounding it simply make no sense, dramatically or logistically.Don't forget the poorly illustrated relationship between Anakin and the future Emperor either (Ian McDiarmid, now playing the young version of his villain from ""Return of the Jedi"").The much hyped love story is also unpleasant, despite a nicely done love theme by John Williams. The majority of it is Anakin leering at Padme like some kind of lusty, sex starved stalker who can't wait to tear all her clothes off and rape the hell out of her and she clearly doesn't like it. Then again, I guess it's hard NOT to leer at a girl like Natalie Portman when everything she wears is either strapless, backless, or gutless. For someone who's a proponent of anti-sleaze in films, Natalie goes out on quite a limb here, even donning black leather (it's like porn for Star Wars fans). The age difference is also an annoying little factor, thus spawning the question of what the older and considerably more mature Padme sees in the future Darth Vader. Bad boy nothing, he continually goes flying off the handle for no apparent reason, even by growing pains standards, and then he goes on the aforementioned killing spree and instead of horrifying her and revolting her it only seems to get her to fall in love with him. I'm all for tragic, doomed love affairs but the truth is that there's no real reason for these two to get together except that Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia need a mom. And what was up with the line about hating sand?Politics are not particularly well done either. Having Jar Jar Binks back and having him play a key role in the rise of the Empire - convincing the senate to okay the creation of the Clone Army thus starting the Clone Wars mentioned in the original film - is quite insulting.The acting is a mixed bag at best. Ewan McGregor manages to make the young Obi-Wan (who now looks like Jesus Christ) a somewhat poetic and likable figure, whilst Samuel L. Jackson is a capable Jedi and Christopher Lee does his usual larger than life villain. Natalie Portman, as cute as she may be, can't make heads nor tails of her Padme, always talking in a flat, high pitched voice that makes her sound too much like a girl and not enough like a woman. Hayden Christensen tries hard but he's either too stiff as Anakin or he's just annoying and, ultimately, he comes off as a sadistic creep. It's not like Al Pacino in the Godfather, where his character was a smart, honorable, well intentioned man who was blind-sided by his own ruthless ambitions. Then again, Christensen doesn't really have much to work with, does he?There are a few neat sequences - the hover chase after Jango Fett, the gladiator arena pitting Obi-Wan, Anakin and Padme against a bunch of beasts, the sight of a bunch of Jedi lighting up their light sabers (don't miss the Jedi who looks like a cone head and the green Jedi with the dread locks), and of course, Yoda's fight with Christopher Lee (but I could have done without the Bruce Lee crowing). However, I have a hard time believing that all these Force powered Jedi could get killed by mindless robots.Kind of makes you wonder how often George Lucas ventures out from his ranch.

I grew up in Marion County, and the first thing I looked for when I saw this movie was accurate depiction of the area, accents, and overall look of the sets. Gotta say, I felt like I was home again.Charlize Theron goes through a major transformation for this movie, where she plays Central Florida serial killer, Aileen Wournos. Not only is the make up and the extra thirty pounds striking as she was uglied down for this role, but her mannerisms, accent and general attitude complete the illusion. Charlize looks so much like Aileen Wournos that when you put her picture next to the real killer's, the resemblance is so uncanny that it gives chills. She also looks a lot like James Hetfield of Metallica fame, but then, so did Aileen Wournos.Her performance is perfect, and Christina Ricci as her selfish, lesibian lover gives a performance that is also well worth watching. Ignorant of her lover's crimes, she pushes her to make more money for them, never realizing until much later that the money is coming from the dead men that are appearing all over Central Florida.Are we expected to feel sorry for Aileen Wournos now that we have the background on how and why she snapped and became this monster? Are we supposed to be sorry that we went to the electric chair? No. While this movie shows us that Aileen's first murder was in self defense, and the second murder was made easier by the post traumatic stress of her first experience, we also see that the other killings are completely calculated and her victims were generally innocent people. Briefly, we see her anguish at killing during an especially disturbing murder scene, but Wournos was not that sorry, so that scene doesn't inspire sympathy for her so much as it leaves a person feeling cold.I would have given this movie five stars except for one thing. The relationship she has with Shelby (Ricci) is too drawn out and slow in developing at first. Then, it seems to be more important than the murders, because we have more screen time with Theron and Ricci making out, arguing, or otherwise planning their next move than we do anything else, which seems to put the murders on the backburner.However, if you want disturbing non-fiction, this movie disturbs on two levels. The first is Charlize Theron herself. She is freakin' amazing. The second is the actual story. It is very hard to watch, but you will be glad you did.

Well, I have to tell you this movie is beyond thrilling. This film is a perfect combination of ""Matrix"" and ""Inception"" and will pump your adrenaline to a maximum level! ""Gravity"" is a life time experience that everyone must see! If you add to the mix that Sandra Bullock and George Clooney star in it as main characters, it just doesn't get better than that!Since this movie has so many genres, it's hard to tell its main one. This movie has adventure, comedy, sorrow, suspense, thrilling scenes, intense scary scenes and so much more! The main one out of all these fantastic genres is definitely suspense. You walk in feeling bored and tired and you walk out feeling like Ryan Stone in the movie. (Sandra Bullock)The thrilling adventure begins when a young medical engineer named Ryan Stone goes up in space to help with installations for the Hubble Telescope. It seems like a casual spacewalk, but when she gets stranded away from her ship, ""Explorer,"" she needs to get back to Earth by hitching a ride on a different station. If you want to find out how and if she and her co-worker,  Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) make it back to Earth alive, you have to watch the film.The movie has so much adventure and so many impressive and clear graphics, it's hard not to like it! You feel like you are right there, experiencing whatever the main characters experience. The acting is amazing and there is deep meaning behind it - what would you do, if you were alone in the deepest and darkest part of this entire universe, with nobody but yourself? What would your thoughts be? Would you be able to remain hopeful or just give up and let Space take you? The camera work is the best I've ever seen. Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n, I give you standing ovation for directing this masterpiece.My favorite scene is when Ryan is stuck in a damaged escape pod with no fuel. She thinks she's stranded.

Well, I have to tell you this movie is beyond thrilling. This film is a perfect combination of ""Matrix"" and ""Inception"" and will pump your adrenaline to a maximum level! ""Gravity"" is a life time experience that everyone must see! If you add to the mix that Sandra Bullock and George Clooney star in it as main characters, it just doesn't get better than that!Since this movie has so many genres, it's hard to tell its main one. This movie has adventure, comedy, sorrow, suspense, thrilling scenes, intense scary scenes and so much more! The main one out of all these fantastic genres is definitely suspense. You walk in feeling bored and tired and you walk out feeling like Ryan Stone in the movie. (Sandra Bullock)The thrilling adventure begins when a young medical engineer named Ryan Stone goes up in space to help with installations for the Hubble Telescope. It seems like a casual spacewalk, but when she gets stranded away from her ship, ""Explorer,"" she needs to get back to Earth by hitching a ride on a different station. If you want to find out how and if she and her co-worker,  Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) make it back to Earth alive, you have to watch the film.The movie has so much adventure and so many impressive and clear graphics, it's hard not to like it! You feel like you are right there, experiencing whatever the main characters experience. The acting is amazing and there is deep meaning behind it - what would you do, if you were alone in the deepest and darkest part of this entire universe, with nobody but yourself? What would your thoughts be? Would you be able to remain hopeful or just give up and let Space take you? The camera work is the best I've ever seen. Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n, I give you standing ovation for directing this masterpiece.My favorite scene is when Ryan is stuck in a damaged escape pod with no fuel. She thinks she's stranded. Before she decides to give up and loose hope of returning to Earth, she starts to see Matt. Matt gets in when she does not have her helmet on and shows her that she can get back.

But I cannot say for an instant that Attack of the Clones was a good motion picture.Let me make one thing clear, however. As a visual artist, George Lucas has no peer. The worlds that he creates are astounding, rich, and full of life. It does not take long for the viewer to become lost in Mr. Lucas' unbelievable creations. Coruscant is a bustling hive of activity, immense and claustrophobic at the same time. Tatooine is a hostile land, teeming with grit and barely perceived danger. These are just two examples of George Lucas' artful hand at work. He is a creator of wonders. A purveyor of fantasy. A genius working at the top of his game.Now for the problems. This may be the most poorly written movie I have ever seen. The script is laughably bad. There were several points during the film, where I had to mentally keep myself from cringing. The scenes between Padme (Natalie Portman) and Anakin (Hayden Christiansen) are painful to watch, and frankly juvenile. I especially enjoyed the ""Sound of Music"" moment once Padme had made it back to her home planet of Naboo. (Watch the film, you can't miss it)I had hoped that Mr. Lucas could have distanced himself from the stilted and moronic dialogue that plagued the Phantom Menace. Sadly, it has gotten worse. He had reduced the Jedi Knights to mumbling, bickering old men, and he had made Senator Amidala a whiny, petulant crone. And Anakin....this character was butchered. Hayden Christiansen is so miscast in this role it is hard to believe he made it through his screen test. Mr. Christiansen is a fine actor, see My Life as a House for proof of his skill. But in the hands of Mr. Lucas and his script, he has been relegated to skulking in the corner like a reprimanded child.All in all, the Attack of the Clones is a Star Wars film, and for fans of the series, that is a great thing.

It comes off kind of cheesy to me. The acting isn't that good for the most part. The screenplay isn't that good, and the directing isn't that good. Also it seems like the shocking scenes were strictly put in to be shocking. Like the scene where they pull out some of the girls intestines. First of all you only see about 3 seconds of it. Secondly, why would they do this? They're not cannibals. They don't play in the blood or rub it on themselves. So the fact that they would do this seems completely unrealistic. I give it 2 1/2 stars for taking the chances it did in 1972. Other than that it's not very good. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1166, 1180)",5,0.0,False

As a child, you're fascinated with all the neat monsters and lasers, especially if you grew up when the show was first in syndication and there was little like it.  When you're in your late teens or twenties, you become more jaded, realizing the effects are rather crude and the acting a bit hammy (or for a minority, you go in the opposite direction and become a die-hard Trekkie).  Finally, you get a little older and you learn to look beyond the faults and re-realize just how fun the show was.The Complete First Season of Star Trek features 29 episodes plus a few bonus features.  For me, many of the episodes were vaguely familiar, even if they hadn't been seen in twenty years or more; others seemed completely new.  Although not presented in original broadcast order, they generally move from the beginning to the end of the season.Of course, the central character in the series is William Shatner's Captain James Kirk, but almost as important are the half-Vulcan, Mr. Spock (Leonard Nimoy) and DeForrest Kelley's Dr. ""Bones"" McCoy.  These two act as rivals for Kirk's ear, the former representing the coldly logical approach to problems and the latter the more irrational humanistic approach.  In the end, Kirk is the one making the choice, however.  Other series characters are rather minor, even if they recur. Uhura, Sulu and Scotty only rarely add much to any story.Not every story is fantastic, and 29 is too many to individually review, but I will comment on a couple.  The Corbomite Maneuver shows Kirk at his best, taking on a vastly more powerful alien with little more than his wits.  The Galileo Seven features Spock in a key role as he tries to save a shipwrecked crew and realizes that hard choices will need to be made if any are to survive.  Shore Leave and Mudd's Women are a bit on the lighter side, but they never get completely silly.  And The City on the Edge of Forever - considered by many (including myself) as the best episode of the whole series - gives Kirk his greatest moral dilemma.Not every episode is good.  Errand of Mercy and A Taste of Armageddon both are a little over-the-top in their anti-war messages.  Miri suffers from both bad child actors and a huge plot hole:  the story takes place on a planet identical to Earth, but there is no reason why this should be the case.  Most episodes are good or great, however, and even these weak ones are still fun to watch.  In the end, you have to also take these episodes in the context of their time, and in this sense, the show was far above any other science-fiction show out there.  So if you're past that second stage of a Star Trek viewer's life, and you can look beyond the faults, this is well-worth watching. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2783, 2797)",2,0.0,False
