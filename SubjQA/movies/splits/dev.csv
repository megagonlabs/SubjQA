(For one thing, the princess doesn't wind up with the &quot;prince&quot; -- a little closer to Pocahontas' real life story).  That said ... the music, animation, and so on are all outstanding.  One of the real surprises in this film is Mel Gibson's talent as a voice actor and *singer* - he's extremely good.  Gibson describes himself as a &quot;shower-only singer,&quot; and I think that is a real misnomer.Pocahontas has her amusing animal friends, Flit (the humming bird) and a truly humorous little raccoon whose name escapes me at the moment.  It is because of her friendship with these animals that she works so hard to convince John Smith (Gibson) of the importance of living in harmony with the land.I think the film carries a couple of good messages, along with its high entertainment value.  The first is, of course, to live in harmony with the land.  The second is that &quot;savage&quot; is often defined by which side of the line you happen to stand on - people often see those who are different as &quot;wrong.&quot;  &quot;Pocahontas&quot; goes a long way toward teaching young people the importance of shedding that viewpoint.

I had low expectations of this film due to all the factors that gave reasoning for this to be a bad film such as the absenses of James Cameron and Linda Hamilton.  But after I saw this film, I was BLOWN AWAY from all those thoughts.  This film was terrific!  It would have been nice Linda Hamilton and Ed Furlong (the kid who played John Conner in T2)to return but not everything is perfect in life.  This easily one of Arnold's best movies he has made in years.  But compared to the first two, this is the worst Terminator movie yet, but it is still a mind blowing action-packed thrill ride.  Atnold's back and better then ever and has his mind set on a new intense adventure as a machine.  Anyway, here is the plot..It has now been ten yrs since skynet was blown away.  Sarah Conner is now deceased and John Conner is now basically doing whatever he can to avoid the life he was destined for.  He basically does what he can to stay alive and keeps traveling hundreds of miles but really has no idea where he is going.  Nut it turns out that blowing up Skynet doesn't prevent Judgement Day; it only postponed it.  That means that the Terminators will still exist, and now there is one a new and very advanced one.  It is called the T-X (Terminatrix), played by Kristanna Loken who is wicked hot!  She is Faster, stronger,and can control and heavy machinery with her mind .  As in she can drive a car, but she won't be in the car, she will be somewhere else while her mind will be controlloing the car.  This Terminator is sent to do the obvious-Kill John Conner.  But that is not all.  Conner isn't going to be the only general in the war against the machines in the future.  There will be other generals in the war and the T-X must kill everynody who will become a general in the future right now so they won't be able to fight in the war.  Also a T-850 (Arnold Schwarzenegger).  It is slighlty more advanced then the T-800's that were sent back in the first 2 films.  His mission is of course protect Conner and his fri9end Kate Brewster (Clare Danes).  It seems that Brewster's father is the man who will create Skynet and is almost finished with the project.  Now it is up to them to stop that from happening and before the T-X can get to them and terminate them.  One other thing, Earl Boen makes a small reappearence as Dr. Silberman (the guy who treated Sarah Conner in the first 2 films)Anyway, T3 is loaded with instense action and lots of destruction.  This film had the most destruction out of the 3.  The only thing that keeps that this film from getting a perfect 5/5 is that part is confusing and there are some things in this movie that seem ridiculous.  Things such as the T-850 kicking an ambnulance and cousing it to tip over.  This film however doesn't come close to as good as the second was.  T2 was way better, even the original Terminator (1984) was better.  But this is still good and should be ssen while it is still in theaters.

However, I did not think the movie was that bad, but actually quite good.  I do not think it is as good as the Lord of the Rings films, Narnia films, or the Harry Potter films, but still fairly enjoyable.  Compared to the string of teen fantasy movies that have come out recently like Percy Jackson or Twilight this movie is god.The story is pretty simple.  It takes place in the distant future.  There was once a big civil war which has left North America in ruins.  Instead of countries there now exists twelve districts.  Each year the capital of Panem forces either a boy or a girl from each district to compete in the Hunger Games where they all battle to the death.  From District 12 a girl named Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) is chosen to compete along with her friend/love interest Gale (Liam Hemsworth).People accuse this film of ripping of another film called Battle Royale.  Firstly I have not seen Battle Royale so I cannot say which film is better.  Secondly, I'm sure that Battle Royale was not the first of its kind either.  Everything is inspired by something.  There have been movies and TV shows that have come out after this that have a similar premise of people put somewhere and are forced to fight to the death.  For all anime fans out there, there is an anime that came out last year (the same year that the Hunger Games came out) called Btooom that has pretty much the same premise yet I do not see many people complaining that that show ripped-off Battle Royale.Plus the film is still well structured, well, acted, and can be entertaining.  The characters are pretty solid.  I do like Katniss and it is easy to sympathize with her given the situation.  The stuff that she goes through is pretty scary and intense.  I can say that I would be dead in the first ten minutes if I was put in the Hunger Games.The movie has some great effects, decent actions scenes, and an interesting world.  I cannot comment on the 3D because I only saw the film in 2D.  There is one complaint I have and that is the middle portion.  I found much of the middle of the film to be kind of boring.  The middle mostly focuses of the political aspect of this world and preparing Katniss for the games.Overall, the Hunger Games was a pleasant surprise.  I did not expect much upon going to see it.  I basically saw it because my mother made me see it.  I have to admit it was much better than I thought it was going to be.  It was nothing incredible but it was still good.

Many reviewers have already said some things that I am going to say, and would have liked to say, but the review will go on, anyway.This is a powerful movie, in which it's main theme centers around drug abuse & addiction, and the dangerous consequences that may follow. But, the film centers on more than just drug abuse and addiction: to me it also centers on life, and how the average folk go about trying to embellish what seems like the emptiness of life. To try and enhance (and possibly) facilitate the meaning of that last sentence, think about this: many people do -- and/or try to reach for -- things that are supposed to make one's life more meaningful and complete: getting married, experiencing the birth of one's first child, going to college, becoming wealthy and/or famous, et al. In society, we are basically brought up to believe that if we follow along certain patterns (e.g. becoming wealthy, etc), we will be happy & fulfilled. One of the many things this film shows us, is that sometimes, what we are brought up to believe, can be a devastating illusion, or at least, there is a strong possibility of this.This story focuses on four main characters, and their addiction to drugs. The story is also cleverly told over the course of four seasons (three, technically), and like another reviewer pointed out a few pages back, the mood of each season correlates with the psychological and circumstantial happenings of each character (or vice versa.) The film starts with the Summer, which correlates with adolescent feelings. In this case, these four characters seemed as if they were happy (or at least we may think they are happy), and seemed to be filled with laughs, smiles and confidence in their future and dreams. In the Autumn, which represents added responsibility, and preparation for ""darker times"", things start to slowly go downhill for the gang. We can see their circumstances beginning to spiral, and their dispositions begin to follow downward as well. By, Winter (which represents ""death"" or the ""ending""), each of these four members seem to meet the ""finality"" of their fates, to disturbing effect, to say the least. Spring, which represents birth, and fresh, new beginnings, never arrived. Heavy stuff, there.Some reviewers have complained about the camera techniques used in this film to be nothing more than flash for flash's sake, and similarly, some have said that some of the disturbing scenes found in the film were there for shock value only. I couldn't disagree more. For starters, like another reviewer has pointed out, the ""speeding up"" and ""slowing down"" techniques are supposed to correlate with the ""speeding"" or ""raciness"" of the characters' thought processes while under the influence of...well...speed (and other drugs.) I found this to be very clever and fascinating. Secondly, while there *are* indeed disturbing images in the film, I didn't necessarily find the images to be the most disturbing aspect of the film, but rather *how* these images were shot. In other words, it's more *psychologically* disturbing, than it is *graphically* disturbing, if that can be basically understood. The way this film was made alone, should not be taken lightly, and it is indeed clever and noteworthy filmmaking. You'd have to see the film for yourself to possibly get a better understanding of what I am talking about.Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans and Jennifer Connelly did wonderful and convincing jobs in their respective roles. Their performances truly helped to make the film what it was, and it wouldn't have been as complete without them. Ellen Burstyn's performance seemed to get a droves-worth of accolades, and deservedly so. Her performance was undoubtedly the most frightening, disturbing and heart-wrenching thing about this film. In moments, her character made me laugh, want to cry, and at other times, made me want to turn my head away from the screen altogether. The whole movie is powerful indeed, and the last segment (Winter) is indeed the most intense and hellish part of the movie.I watched this film with another member of my family, and by the time the ""Winter"" segment had arrived, we were *both* saying things like, ""I will *never* watch this movie again. It's a little *too* much reality."" Nightmarish, disturbing, cautionary, thought-provoking, and moving, this film will stay in your mind long after it has ended, and many will gather their own responses as to what the movie meant to them. And, if some of you think that what happened to these characters can't happen to anyone in real-life, think again: it's *very* real, and *can* happen (and no doubt *has* happened to some in real-life.) Indeed, reality can be too much at times.Before I close out this review, let me share a brief story with you about someone who used drugs: it was documented in a program (I can't remember the name of it right now) that a female experimented with a drug, and not too long after that, her friends were quick to comment that she was becoming excessively paranoid and delusional. She was sent to a specialist who did a brain scan on her. When the doctor took a look at the scan, we the viewers (and no doubt the girl, and her mother, who happened to be alongside her) saw something *very* disturbing: there were various holes -- large holes -- throughout her brain: like the equivalent of looking at a piece of cheese after a mouse had nipped through it quite well. The result? This girl now suffers from acute bipolar/manic-depressive disorder. And you know what else? This was the result of her experimenting with a drug: after ONLY ONE TRY! That's right, this girl is now stuck with a ""psychotic disorder"" for the rest of her life, as the result of her experimenting with a drug after only *one* try. Yes, indeed, reality can be a bummer. I recommend seeing this film at least once; this goes for everyone. ANSWERNOTFOUND","Nightmarish, disturbing, cautionary, thought-provoking, and moving","(4429, 4495)",1,0.8,True

Usually I don't understand superhero movies; I watched all three Spider-Man movies and I still don't understand, I didn't get the second X-Men movie, and I didn't like Fantastic 4. But The Dark Knight takes a different approach for all movie goers. It's easy to understand (Usually I need a superhero guru of knowledge to explain things to me), it didn't focus too much on relationships (Unlike Spider-Man), and it was more about action than talking.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: Batman (a.k.a. Bruce Wayne) is considered a fugitive by Gotham City, and is wanted despite his heroism and getting scum off the street like the mob groups. He eventually forms an alliance with the police and the district attorney Harvey Dent, and even his former girlfriend Rachel, and together they remove several mob groups and hundreds of fugitives are arrested. All seems to be well for a small period of time until a person known only as The Joker shows up and starts killing people, all in return for Batman to reveal himself or more people get killed. Batman becomes the most despised person in Gotham over the fact that people's lives are being taken every day because of him, and there is nothing they can do about it. So Batman must hunt down The Joker and save his friends and the citizens of Gotham City, only this movie doesn't end how you'd predict it to.MUSIC: The music is fantastic and goes great with the already near-perfect film.DISTURBING FACTOR: I never expected a superhero movie to be this creepy and disturbing. There are some scenes which make this film borderline an R-rating for how violent some of them are. Heath Ledger really does a great job at portraying Joker as a complete psychopath who you'd be terrified to come across.ACTION: Lots of shooting, lots of hand-to-hand combat, lots of vehicular mayhem, lots of explosions, and even more!

The base material, Rand's novel, was certainly intriguing enough, and from what I saw of the trailers, this movie looked very good.Now that I have seen part 1 (the book was so long, to do it justice they have to make the movie in several parts) I have to say I am hooked and will eagerly look for the subsequent parts.To start with, it is an intriguing story, part mystery, part sci-fi, and heavy social commentary. The characters are very strong, and the only down side is a bit of naivet&eacute; on Rand's part about how easily a government can be corrupted by misplaced altruism (although in the movie it is really corporate shenanigans to beat each other out of the market) and how blameless and honorable fiercely independent capitalists are (which history has proved may not always be the case).That was Rand's perspective and the movie seems to be faithful to her vision, which is great -- because movies should be faithful to their source material.So, if you have problems with the philosophy or politics of the movie, look to the original author and not the film. The film is being faithful.Instead, enjoy this film for the breadth and scope of the grand adventure it displays. It delivers plenty of eye candy -- and some food for thought.I have read Atlas Shrugged -- as a book it is a bargain because it is so LONG! You get your money's worth with an engrossing story that goes on and on. The movie follows suit quite nicely.I won't go over the complex plot, but will point out what I think makes this a valuable film:1. It follows the book very closely. Things you like and don't like about the book are here pretty much as the author intended, so the emotional impact is as strong in the film as it is in the novel.2. The production values are high. I have read it was a low budget movie, but it certainly appeared high budget to me. For one thing we see how the rich and ""famous""--  or infamous... take your pick depending on the character -- live and ""hang out"". Everything in the scenery, makeup, and effects look very genuine and believable.3. The movie, like the book, maintains a good level of suspense. Will Reardon Metal fail? Will the John Galt Line succeed in its first run? What is the mysterious ""super engine"" prototype and who created it? Having read the book, I know the answer and I won't give it away here. Suffice it to say, when we find out, there is a definite emotional experience to it.4. The actors are all very good, and there are a few easily recognizable character actors as well as some new comers. As for their characters -- the good guys are reasonably good, and the bad guys are reasonably slimy. But be warned, Rand's villains often come off stronger than her heroes in that they engender a stronger emotional reaction. This movie follows that line of thinking.5. The musical score and soundtrack are excellent. Appropriate volume (nicely equalized) and they avoid the clich&eacute; of musical clashes to alert the audience when something unexpected is about to happen. Nice job.6. Because this is a bit of a hi-tech story (the new metal, the new designs for bridges and other technological advances) they need some CGI effects to pull it off. When we see the new John Galt ""super"" train, it really does look super! I'm a sucker for trains anyway, and to see this neat high speed rail line, even as CGI, was very exciting. It was even more so because much of the second half of the movie is filmed in Colorado with amazing natural vistas and beautiful skylines. This could have been a travel film, the natural scenery was photographed so well.------------------------------Conclusion:If you want to see a movie that is refreshingly close to the original source (with all its benefits and faults), a film that has a ""rich"" look to it, a film that has suspense, mystery a bit of sci-fi or at least high tech, and some really good looking actors doing a great and believable job, then I think you will enjoy this film.5-stars for a job well done that I really enjoyed.

While the similarities between Oblivion and Top Gun end at the aforementioned, there is no question that ""Maverick"" has all the right moves to portray galactic mechanic, Jack Harper in the most visually dazzling film of the year so far.Oblivion opens in 2077 after an alien threat has left Earth a barren wasteland fit only for extracting a few vital resources before humanity abandons the planet altogether to start a new existence on Saturn's largest moon, Titan. Cruise's Harper is a glorified serviceman who supervises and repairs the various resource-extraction devices along with his partner Victoria (Andrea Riseborough). As the two near the completion of their jobs on Earth, Harper begins having visions of his life prior to the mandatory memory-wipe that is required for service-workers. These visions lead him on a chain of events that cause him to question everything he thought he knew about his life.Director Joseph Kosinski creates a vividly rich and nuanced futuristic environment where much of the technology feels like what truly is on the horizon. Kosinski directed 2010's under-rated visual spectacle, Tron Legacy, and it is apparent that he has his finger on the pulse of crisp, sci-fi style. Narrative-wise, Oblivion is a much more complex story than is likely expected. The complexities do provide some depth to the film and force the audience to pay close attention; however, the juxtaposition between the style and the narrative is not smooth. Occasionally, the film is forced into a lull as it tries to tie up its intricate plot points without sacrificing its visual pageantry. This is most apparent in the scenes that develop the sub-plot involving a human resistance leader named Beech (Morgan Freeman) and a mysterious NASA survivor named Julia (Olga Kurylenko).Oblivion's chief attributes are clearly its visual elements. Freeman and Kurylenko's characters are thinly developed and the actors are mostly unremarkable. However, it is becoming more and more apparent that any film that features Morgan Freeman in any role is most likely not a bad movie. Thematically, the film is successful at developing some intriguing ideas about discovery and purpose. The film acts as a subtle homage to familiar films like Alien, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and even Wall-E. Speaking of familiar, the score is oddly reminiscent of Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight films. This is simply an observation, but having Morgan Freeman in the film as well certainly makes one wonder if this is some form of statement. Regardless, while some will no doubt be puzzled or dissatisfied with the conclusion, Oblivion mostly works as an epic and visually alluring entry into the science-fiction canon. B+On a side note, seeing the film in IMAX or an XTREME screen is recommended as the film has so much to offer visually. Oblivion is rated PG-13 and runs 125 minutes.

I bought it the week it came out, just like all the other Star Wars sets that have come before.  I have the original set from the early 80's, the letterbox version, the re-release version of the mid 90's, the special editions and now the DVDs.I have three versions of The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones on DVD, let's not go into all the other Star Wars stuff I just can't seem to part with in 20+ years of collecting ect, ect....Suffice it to say, I am a huge Star Wars fan.  Oh yea, and I am a mid-30 year old gal.With all that in mind, here is my humble review.I loved the set.  It was crisp, clear, clean, the picture is absolutely gorgeous.  The soundtrack is so clear, you can't hear any distortions.  If this is what we have been waiting for all these years, fine with me!The Bonus material is really cool. There are a few documentaries, specials & TV commercials.  I loved watching the old trailers. I remembered them as soon as I saw them!  Very cool.  I wish they had added the older CBS docu-special that they did in '79 or '80 with C-3PO & R2-D2, my taped copy is in really bad shape.  That is fun to watch just to see them bickering.I haven't seen them all, but I have seen two so far.  Well worth the price of the set on their own.For the changes:1.  The Emperor/Vader scene in The Empire Strikes Back -  I think it flows a bit better.  And having Ian in the scene is much more believable.2.  Biggs scene in Star Wars:  A New Hope.  It's a bit out of place since you don't see the friendship with the two developed a bit more.  I believe the only way to see those scenes are on the Insiders CD-ROM of a few years back (and the novel).  So I was able to piece that together in my mind, but I suspect that the new fan or someone who was a casual viewer might go, who is that?3.  The biggest change of course is Hayden replacing Sebastian Shaw.  Okay, I'll admit it, this was the one and only time I cringed for a Star Wars update.  I thought why?  But, I have to eat my words.  It *worked*.  I liked the effect.  Now, I will say they should have gone a step further:  Where is Qui-Gon?  If they went as far as changing out Sebastian, where is Qui-Gon?  hmm?  you know, the guy who found our little bundle of midi-chlorians?  But back to Hayden, the effect was believable, it looked like he was there back in '83.  Do I miss Sebastian?  No.  Why? I have 4 prior sets of VHS tapes that are mine forever to watch when I want to see the big guy.  More Star Wars to watch and enjoy.Nit-picks:I want the added scenes.  Where is Luke on Tatooine fixing the vaporators, hanging with Biggs?  Yea, I listened to the commentary for Star Wars, I heard what George said.  Bonus disk, Bonus George...  I want the sandstorm scenes in RoTJ, I want R2's run in with a wampa...  At least they are on the CD-Roms, but still.  I am very greedy.Let's face it, these movies were written and released 20 + years ago.  Qui-Gon and crew were not yet around, so George is attempting to tie the whole series together.  I think he is doing a good job at it.  The changes flow, they don't leap! out at you saying, hey I'm a new scene, yoo hoo!The reason they seem that way to most older fans is simply because we are used to seeing the movie a certain way for over 20 years.People reading this may wonder why on earth I am happy there are all these changes.  I remember the 80's, after 1983 when Return was out. I remember all the years when Star Wars was done, gone and pretty much forgotten.  There were the West End game books, and that, folks, was it.  One thing I would get so upset about is you could find book ater book on Star Trek, nothing on Star Wars. It was pretty pathetic for the Star Wars fan.  Then the mid 90's came, Timothy Zahn and the new movies.  Star Wars has been back ever since.At the end of the day, would I like to have the older versions?  Sure. But, I am of the opinion the more Star Wars the better.  So, in my mind, George, thanks!  Bring it on, new & old, updates & special.  The more Star Wars from the Father of the Force, is fine by this Star Wars fangirl. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(4106, 4120)",1,0.0,False

Not only does this movie nail the 70's in so many ways, but mirrors current events (New Jersey) in such perfect concordance, that it seems completely predictive of a thousand news stories circling the planet. How current does a movie have to be when it looks deep in the heart of darkness in American politics and then it all plays out right in front of us?American Hustle is an excellent and entertaining Comedy/Crime Drama that combines great direction,a terrific cast,a wonderful script and a fantastic soundtrack all of those elements make American Hustle a great film that has to be seen.Set in New York City in the late 1970s,American Hustle tells the story of two con artists,Irving Rosenfield(Christian Bale)and Sydney Prosser(Amy Adams)who have been forced by FBI agent Richie DiMasso(Bradley Cooper)to participate in a FBI operation called ABSCAM,a sting operation to set up corrupt politicians including Camden,New Jersey Mayor Carmine Polito(Jeremy Renner)and gangsters. As the stakes become higher and with danger coming at every corner Irving and Sydney have to figure out how to get out and survive.Throughout the history of cinema,con artists and Grifters have been covered in movies ranging from The Sting(1973),The Grifters(1990)and now American Hustle,an amazing film from beginning to end that keep your attention with fantastic movie making that never stops. Right from it's weird and offbeat opening American Hustle is a movie that combines Comedy,Crime Drama and a true life tale that is funny and quirky and at other times serious and intense giving viewers a movie that plays by it's own rules and creates it's own world. With American Hustle David O'Russell gives us a movie that is dazzling bringing viewers into the crime world of the 1970s showing the personal and professional lives of con artists,federal agents,politicians and gangsters never knowing where the story or it's characters will go and even though AH is a fact based story the movie is not too dark. When you look at AH you will see that the movie was obviously influenced in many ways by Martin Scorsese's classic Gangster epics such as Goodfellas(1990)and Casino(1995)with the way the camera moves,the style and look of the film and the use of narration replacing Gangsters and Mobsters with con artists but O'Russell takes the style and makes it his own. The Comedy in AH is great and hilarious because the laughs are never forced on viewers or telling them when scenes are funny but lets the viewers figure out when scenes are funny whether it's in some of the scenes or in the main characters dialog or actions. The Comedy is balanced out by the Crime Drama elements as well which are done with attention and detail like a other Crime Dramas and you are gripped with every scene that involves cops and crime. But the Crime Drama element isn't always serious and is entertaining. The beautiful photography by Linus Sandgren and amazing production design by Judy Becker truly add to the film and give AH a realistic look and feel of the 1970s with vibrant colors and sets that pull you into the world that AH wants to portray and it's one of the reasons the movie succeeds. The main characters in the film whether it's the con artists,federal agents are fascinating and interesting with laughs and depth because with each main character everyone wants to succeed at what they do whether it's good or bad. Also,with the characters there is no black and white but a gray area that is complex and real and you will relate to some of the characters in some ways. The screenplay by Eric Singer and David O'Russell is impressive and well-done with dialog that is a mixture of funny and serious. The ending of American Hustle is wonderful,surprising and unexpected and fits with films about con artists and Grifters. An outstanding conclusion to a great movie.The whole cast is amazing. Christian Bale is excellent and at his best as Irving Rosenfield,with Bale bringing intensity and emotional(and physical)depth to the role. Bradley Cooper is brilliant and funny as FBI agent Richie DiMasso,with Copper being offbeat and dramatic. Amy Adams is terrific and beautiful as Sydney Prosser,Irving's partner in crime and has great scenes with Bale,Cooper and Lawrence. Jeremy Renner is outstanding as Mayor Carmine Polito,a New Jersey politician. Jennifer Lawrence is amazing and sexy as Roselyn Rosenfield,Irving's attractive but overbearing wife. Also,lookout for a great uncredited appearance from Robert De Niro in a great performance as Victor Tellegio,a high level gangster. Louis C.K(Stoddard Thorsen),Jack Huston(Pete Musane),Michael Pena(Paco Hernandez),Shea Whigham(Carl),Alessandro Nivola(Anthony Amando)and Paul Hermane(Alfonse Simone)give good performances as well.The direction by David O'Russell is brilliant and stylish,with O'Russell always moving the camera with tracking shots,close-ups and a nice visual style.

Arnold Schwarzenegger's screen presence was also an added plus in the 1990 film, as well as the one-liners, Mars and of course heaps of bloody violence. If you've seen the original, then you know how it goes.Len Wiseman's remake of the same name replaces Arnold with Colin Farrell, in his first lead action role in years, while eliminating Mars as the backdrop of the action and replacing it with an overpopulated Earth where transportation from one corner to another occurs, literally, straight through the center of the earth. The rugged subterranean mazes of the red planet is replaced with dizzying skyscrapers and lots of sleek, flying cars, not unlike Philip K. Dick's own ""Blade Runner"" and ""Minority Report"".Farrell can act and is definitely a strong action lead and it shows here, as per the beautiful ladies Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel who both show off brawn over beauty here. Alas, everything is taken way too seriously in this version. I have fonder memories of the Verhoeven/Arnold version where one-liners come post-Arnie-kill. Gone. Certain characters are trimmed or even cut completely from the original. Bryan Cranston's Cohaagen makes me miss Ronny Cox even more, and Bill Nighy's resistance leader doesn't stand out compared to the 1990 film. The best thing the screenwriters did is to combine Sharon Stone's and Michael Ironside's characters from the 1990 film into one, and as portrayed by Kate Beckinsale, she kicks serious ass here.The script is a near complete rehash of the original, save for the setting and the final act of the film. The scene where Bokeem Woodbine's character tries to convince Quaid (Farrell) where he's still in a dream is certainly a standout scene which was very well done. Alas, the majority of the movie is laced with action sequences and sensational special effects (seriously, this is CGI porn) that may get this film a nomination for Best Visual Effects this year. No kidding. While the editing is fast-paced and the cinematography sleek (with a little too much lens flare ala J. J. Abrams), the music score by Harry Gregson- Williams was kind of bland in my opinion. It was just there, does its job, and I didn't care. Where's Marco Beltrami; or even for that matter his legendary mentor, the late, great Jerry Goldsmith when you need them?Director Wiseman has a knack for action sequences (""Underworld"", ""Die Hard 4"") and it shows aplenty here. Sadly the script could've been a whole lot better, but then again, if they had set it on Mars it would've been a shot-for-shot remake with better characters, but still I would've loved to see action on the Red planet once again. The PG-13 rating is justified, and there are indeed little homages to the original, but overall this remake is nothing more than a fast-paced, popcorn munching good waste of time, with some really nice CGI to chew on.However, I'd rather watch the old one again. Arnie has a much stronger screen presence than Farrell and it is much more ambitious and has more heart than this sleeker, newer one. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3126, 3140)",1,0.0,False

And I don't mean to bore you with details, so I won't.  But there's a lot of ground to cover.First, some context.  Believe it or not, I never read or was read ""The Hobbit"", though I own it on audiobook (but I keep falling asleep while it's playing).  I also never bothered to watch any of the ""Star Wars"" movies (no, none of them).  Therefore, I have no comparison point to the book or Jar Jar Binks which everyone else seems to want to throw this under.  I did watch the extended editions of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, and I will do some comparatives there.For those that don't know the book, this has actually little to do with the book itself.  In fact, while it shares the name and the basic premise, there is a lot of fluff thrown in for 'good' measure.  It is important that you approach this movie the way I did: It is essentially a prologue to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, a device to help explain what happened before the ""Fellowship of the Ring"".  While the book is supposed to be the same, there were a lot of missing elements in the story due to J.R. Tolkien not living long enough to get everything tied up.  His son tried, but this movie is really the first time we see the puzzle pieces fitting together.  The end result is rather confusing, so try best to follow along.The movie begins with a voiceover from Bilbo Baggins, who is writing what will eventually be ""There And Back Again: A Hobbit's Tale"", seen at the end of the ""Return of the King"".  What he is speaking is found in the letter that he has left for Frodo at the end of his adventure.  It then goes to the now infamous starting line from the book: ""In a hole in the ground, there lived a hobbit..."" and the whole first few sentences.  It then goes to a brief conversation between Bilbo and Frodo (yes, Elijah Wood).  This culminates into a first meeting with Gandalf, and the dwarves who are embarking on an adventure.I had a number of problems with how this started.  It felt like Jackson was trying desperately to match what was said in the book - down to the corny diatribe from Gandalf to Bilbo - even though none of it matched the character.  Yet, the full duration of the movie is full with blatant attempts to be a prequel to ""Lord of the Rings"".  As such one would expect somewhat clear personality similarities, especially with Gandalf, that simply aren't there in the first parts of the movie.  Secondly, while I wasn't as upset with the dwarf-at-hobbit-hole scene as other reviewers, I had tons of questions.  Why are they not questioning their being sent there?  Why are they simply trusting of Gandalf that this hobbit is the right person?  And why was Bilbo so eager to join the squad?  Again, from what little I recall from the story, Bilbo is constantly reluctant to go on the adventure the entire time.  Yet in the movie this is brushed off as just a brief hesitation.Once the real adventure begins, the movie starts a sharp divergence from the story.  It still keeps certain elements but there are many others that were simply patched in from other Tolkien stories such as ""The Silmarillion"" and ""Unfinished Tales"".  For example, there isn't a serious session with Saruman and Galadriel with Agent Lord Elrond, with Saruman chewing Gandalf out for making the party (BTW, when Elrond said ""purpose"", he WAS Agent Smith.  Poor Hugo).  There's no epic battle with Albino orcs.  The list goes on and on, and clearly the intent is to maintain the same level of majesty found in the trilogy, so it's understandable why fans of the book might be miffed at some of what's thrown in, nevermind exposing certain characters that were never in ""The Hobbit"" to begin with (aka Frodo and others).The remainder of the movie is wrought with the same amount of orchestral marching scenes panning gorgeous landscapes in New Zealand as are found in the trilogy.  Thinking of this movie in a different angle, you might not expect this since the book itself is quite short and not the epic adventure that the movie portrays it to be; this is precisely why I say that you must set aside that expectation before approaching the movie.  Seen as simply a prequel to the trilogy, everything makes perfect sense and obviously that's how Jackson saw the endeavor.  He wasn't trying to turn the book literally into the movie (though the first 30 minutes would convince you otherwise).Much has been made of Radagast the Brown.  Turned from a couple of colorful sentences in the book to a larger-than-life character, Radagast's parts could easily have been excluded entirely.  He adds nothing to the story except finding a certain sword that is shown to Saruman (and thus dismissed as unverified).  I didn't have as much issue with how the character was presented with bird droppings in his beard and down the side of his face; indeed, most book-to-movie attempts result in the exact same (see ""A Wrinkle in Time"" by Disney as a perfect example).  As with the aforementioned, if the target is to appeal to the children that read the book rather than the child that is now an adult watching the movie, sometimes it's better to leave well enough alone.Regarding the Blu-ray...my TV, an Insignia that I got about 3 years ago at a really good deal, has the ability to closely emulate the 48fps that the movie was presented at in theaters; just not in 3D (I hate 3D).  So I was able to experience the ""speed"" of things that people were talking about.  The best way I can describe it would be like a play, or a live action event where you are watching things right there on set while they're filming it. It didn't bug me too much since Back to the Future Blu-ray did the same thing at times, but where it got weird is any scene that was filmed with obvious fake props.  The most notable I saw was a scene where they panned over a landscape that was obviously not real; fake trees stuck into fake grass rather than a real area.  Also, when Gandalf is talking to Galadriel, the pillars to her left and right were too fake looking.  Gandalf himself, it was just seeing Ian McKellen in makeup all the time, unlike the trilogy where he blended into the character so well.  Overall, the quality was so clear and clean that you were easily able to see such imperfections and it took you out of the movie, combined with this new filming speed.If I had to name my biggest complaints, it would be the fight scenes; every last one of them.  They're all the same: party gets stuck into some sort of impossible situation with enemies twice or larger their size.  Even with so many dwarves they still manage to get beat down and either tied up, incapacitated, or stuck.  In every situation except one, Bilbo is the one that saves them.  This is stark opposite of the trilogy where Frodo didn't do hardly anything.  In fact Frodo was more of a coward than Bilbo in the movie even though the book has Bilbo being less willing to chip in and save the day.Then there is the introduction of Bilbo to Gollum.  A lot of people applaud this as the best scene in the movie, but frankly it was nothing special.  The Gollum character was played well, and the creepy mannerisms are something to behold, but the scene itself was quite unremarkable.Frankly, it was not a bad movie nor was it too long.  I didn't get the same sense of overall fulfillment from it that I got from Fellowship, nor did I gain much from the Bilbo character here.  Bilbo in the trilogy was a lot more entertaining overall, and ""The Hobbit"" at times felt mislabeled; as though it should have been called ""The Dwarven Quest"" because they dominated the screenplay almost exclusively.  This might have been in response to complaints about Frodo and Sam dominating the trilogy; I'm not sure.  In any case, as long as you don't bring book bias the movie is worth a watch.  But don't expect it to blow you away.  It's a decent movie, not a great one.If you buy the Blu-ray be sure to opt for the triple set with 3D Blu-ray, regular Blu-ray, and DVD.  It was 2 bucks more than the non-3D version.  If you do get a 3D TV in the future then you'll already be set.  I wouldn't worry about the extended edition unless you're so fan clouded you must have it, but I felt the movie was quite long enough.

Better than Ridley Scott's original, and I don't say that about many sequels. Beautifully shot with wonderfully dark and claustrophobic cinematography. Sigourney Weaver's performance is sublime, and you can tell she takes her craft very seriously. James Cameron's direction is taut and soaked in adrenalin. On the flip side, Bill Paxton's performance is execrable, though. He never could act, and I was glad when one of the aliens finally dragged his screaming, hysterical butt to his doom, probably just to shut him up. It's nice that there are two versions of the movie to choose from; I prefer the original theatrical version.Transfer quality: Average for Blu-ray, in my opinion. There's a lot of grain in many places. The graininess does add to the dark, foreboding quality of the movie, but to be honest if I had known there would be that much grain I would have just settled for the DVD version. It is possible that the decision to not ""clean up"" the grain was made because often that cleanup process softens the video quality, so maybe it was deliberate. I do appreciate the 1.85:1 aspect ratio - I like having the picture fill the entire screen as opposed to thick black bars at the top and bottom of the screen. Audio sounds very good through my home theater system, and is the quality I expect from Blu-ray.Extras - Not too many, not that I expected much in the way of extras in a rock-bottom price Blu-ray. The deleted scenes are always fun to watch, and gets you playing the ""what if"" game - would the movie have been better or worse if the scenes had been left in the original theatrical release? The audio commentaries are somewhat informative, but I never did care for those too much, so I only turn them on for the sake of reviewing a movie here. The isolated James Horner scores are nice to listen to, though.Overall, a great movie and a solid product. If your main motivation is just purchasing the movie and not worrying about a lot of extras (as it was for me), this will do you nicely. Serious fans of the franchise may well wish to invest in theAlien Anthology [Blu-ray], which has a lot more supporting material. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2364, 2378)",1,0.0,False

Sure, Saving Private Ryan has many unforgettable scenes and images, but so what?  Great bits make not a great  movie.  The gruesome beach invasion that opens the movie is shocking and  spectacular up to a point, but quickly becomes boring.  Come on, any film  that extends a scene comprised entirely of soldiers in combat to 25 minutes  is seriously pushing its luck, no matter how 'worthy' the subject matter.  What follows is one and a half not terribly interesting hours of not  terribly interesting characters debating the merits of their mission and  getting into the occasional scrape.  The final battle is perhaps the most  engrossing part of an otherwise limp movie.  I do wish directors like  Steven Spielberg would resist the temptation to make their 'important'  movies last three hours; there is simply no reason other than ego stroking.  Saving Private Ryan is essentially a terrific two hour movie fighting to  get out of a tiresome three hour running time.  Also, when will Spielberg  return to making his films in the 2.35:1 widescreen process?  His last five  films were shot in the smaller 1.85:1 aspect ratio and as a result they  look like nothing more than glorified television programmes.  Unfortunate.

This is how the story goes: When the crew of the Enterprise is called back home, they find an unstoppable force of terror from within their own organization has detonated the fleet and everything it stands for, leaving our world in a state of crisis. With a personal score to settle, Captain Kirk leads a manhunt to a war-zone world to capture a one man weapon of mass destruction. As our heroes are propelled into an epic chess game of life and death, love will be challenged, friendships will be torn apart, and sacrifices must be made for the only family Kirk has left: his crew.The cast led by Chris Pine (as Captain James T. Kirk), Zachary Quinto (as Commander Spock), Zoe Saldana (as Lieutenant Uhura), Karl Urban (as Dr. Leonard 'Bones' McCoy), Simon Pegg (as Commander Montgomery 'Scotty' Scott), John Cho (as Lieutenant Hikaru Sulu), Benedict Cumberbatch (as John Harrison), Anton Yelchin (as Ensign Pavel Chekov), Bruce Greenwood (as Admiral Christopher Pike), Peter Weller (as Admiral Marcus) & Alice Eve (Dr. Carol Marcus) is excellent. The directing by J.J. Abrams (who also produced) is excellent. The story & screenplay (based on the TV series created by Gene Roddenberry) by Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman & Damon Lindelof (all three also produced the film, as well) is excellent.The music by Michael Giacchino is excellent.

The stunts coordinated by John Stoneham Jr., fights coordinated by Marcus Young is excellent.This is an excellent, well-made and well-crafted (thematically and visually) movie and sequel that is just as entertaining and interesting as its original, possibly better than it. This is also another impressive entry in the Star Trek franchise. Chris Pine & Zachary Quinto, among others, are back, reprising the roles from the original, just as well, possibly, better than the first time. Benedict Cumberbatch's John Harrison is an excellent and well-done villain, right alongside the Star Trek villains of the past. J.J. Abrams has crafted another entertainingly done film that is among one of his best movies of his career, beside the last ""Star Trek"" & ""Super 8"", also another well-crafted sequel on Abrams' resume, alongside, ""Star Trek"" & ""Mission Impossible III & Ghost Protocol"". This is one of the best movies of the year, so far, and it is also one of the best movies of the summer season, so far, as well, possibly, the best summer movie yet.

He peopled this world with an interesting group of misfits who somehow became a family by Episode 14. In Serenity much of the family atmosphere disappears and we are left with a medium budget action film. This is not necessarily bad just different.The film starts about six months after the close of the series. River Tam (Summer Glau) has been broken out of a Government facility by her brother Simon (Sean Maher). River has unwittingly been turned into a weapon by the government but more frightenly she harbors a secret that has the potential to weaken the govenment itself. An assassin (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is sent to find her and bring her back at all costs.Without spoilers that is the premise of the film. The characters are all ther from the show but they have changed in the time between the show's cancellation and the film's release. The Captain (Nathan Fillion) has become darker and more withdrawn. I think that his character is now closer to Whedon's original vision of him in the pilot episode. Other characters are not used as much as some of the fans may have wished but this is a limited run time film with nine main characters.Whedon keeps the film running smoothly for its entire run time and the film looks more epic than the TV show ever could. As a side note the cinematography of Jack Green looks fantastic even though I enjoyed the work of David Boyd on the television show a little more with its rougher edged look. The music is now by David Newman and ids much more thematic than that of Greg Edmonson.I watched the two disc Collector's Edition. The picture and sound were almost perfect. There are two commentary tracks: one featuring the cast which is more anecdotal and a more technical commentary by Whedon himself. Also available are numerous featurettes; some outtakes and deleted and extended scenes.This may be one that appeals more to fans of the original series but the film stands on its own quite well. By all means see it. ANSWERNOTFOUND,ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2148, 2162)",1,0.0,False

DVD hides CGI flaws, lower resolution, Blu makes things stand out even more, at the beginning of Towers, Gollum seems to float above the ground in some scenes.

I will not buy the &quot;first&quot; three either (unless they release a NON-special edition version). I'm not going to make Lucas or Fox any richer on my dollar.I'm not going to talk about what this movie could have been. Everybody has their theories about what they wanted to see on that screen after waiting 20 years. I want to approach this movie on it's own, and not as part of a universe. The main reason that Alien 3 was so disappointing was because of the story line inconsistency with the previous movies. It was terrible what that film did to the story that Scott and Cameron had built up, but taken on it's own it's not really that bad of a film. I wanted to give the Menace the same chance.To address some arguments before I begin. First, as far as I know, in 1977, Star Wars was not made for children. Star Wars did not cater to children. It had audiences from 5 to 75 fascinated. Not just 3-13 year old future Gen-Xers, but all audiences fell in love with that movie. In LA, people in their twenties and thirties went to see Star Wars two to three times a day. This film was ground breaking and blew people's minds. Sure, when you see ""Star Wars"" or ""2001:A Space Odyssey"" now, it is possible to forget the impact these movies had. Taken in context of when they were released, these movies inspired, confused, and awed audiences of ALL AGES world wide.Second, I state that children do not need to be catered to. When I was eight years old I saw one of the greatest films ever made, Raiders of the Lost Arc. At that time in my then short life, Raiders was the most incredible thing that I had ever seen. As an eight-year-old, believe it or not, I did not need a flatulant pack animal or a goofy sidekick or a ""yippee"" child to keep my attention. I enjoyed a movie that was able to be very fun and intelligent on it's own merits.Now on to the menace. The first thing seen in this movie are bug-like aliens who have overdubbed Asian accents that don't match their lip movements. In the beginning of this epic space opera, the director starts us off with the equivalent to what we see at 2:00 in the morning watching 70's Kung Fu movies. Bad overdubbing.Next we get our buddy. The Jar-ster. I don't think I need to comment. Within the first two minutes on screen the Biggs quotes Wayne's World. How ""current"" to make reference to a movie that came out in 1991. I'm sure at least half of the 1300+ reviews below me have gone into how hideous this character is, so I don't need to. The Phantom Edit speaks for millions....""exsqueeze me""?????!?!?!?!?The ""bad guys"" in this film, rather than the menacing Stormtroopers, are a group of rickety robots. They don't have any emotional quality to them, so the only way to make them threatening is to show them in immense numbers. Who are the robots the biggest threat to? The CG gungens. Oh...no real loss there. The gungens are rather annoying anyway, and watching the CG robots attack the CG gungens doesn't really impact the film viewer in any way.The pod race was 80% there. The sports announcers really took from that scene. It brought the movie out of ""long ago and far away"" to USA Saturday Football game. It totally killed the suspension of disbelief that a viewer tries to build up. Also, the race was so ... boring that Jabba even fell asleep. Yippee!What I put above are what would give this film two or three stars. Add into the mix that Darth Vader built C-3PO, the really stupid space battle where Anakin accidentally blows up the robot control ship...whoops, the E.T.'s that were in the Galactic Council. The stupid accents given to every alien race, rather than developing a creative language like Jawwa, Huttes, and Ewok. Changing the Zen philosophies of ""Empire"" into mitochondria...*cough* I mean midichlorians.What gives this film the 0-1 star rating is the lack of character. I don't give ... about special effects. Clerks, Rear Window, The Godfather, Reservoir Dogs, and Goodfellas had hardly any special effects, but are superior films because the characters are fascinating. Special Effects can only help a movie, and will never make a movie great unless there is meat underneath them. As the now gone Eon Magazine said, Obi-Wan was basically a glorified mechanic in this film. His job was to...fix the ship. At last Darth Maul will have his revenge. For what? Qui-gon is on the outs with the Jedi council...why?My Phantom edit: Give Qui-gon and Darth Maul more flushing out and back story. Cut out the gungens completely. Edit the space battle so it's exciting. Cut the slave stuff out. We've spent 3 movies on Tatooine now, time to move on. Spend an additional 20 minutes on Corsecant (sp?). Spend 20 fewer minutes on Tatooine. Spend a lot less time on gungen planet. Try to edit the other action sequences to be as exciting as the light saber duels. There's too much to fix, so I maintain my 0-1 star rating. I hope the second film will be better, but I'm not holding my breath. A friend of mine at ILM tells me that they will return to that desert planet a fourth time, and have just as much frigging Jar Jerk as before.

I ordered the DVD set on a lark. I have always like Science Fiction and have looked for film/video adaptations. I have usually been disappointed but I keep trying. Finding a gem like this one makes the effort worth while.The basic premise is of the crew of a tramp freighter who make their way by carrying freights, the occasional smuggling job and a few other less than legal operation. These are invariably conducted against people who deserve to have been on the losing side. The captain and first mate are old war buddies. They were both on the losing side of a civil war. The mate is married to the ships pilot. The ship's engineer is a sweet, somewhat nave and technically competent young lady. A tough, mercenary type rounds out the regular crew.In the first episode, they take on a series of passengers. One of them is a ""shepherd"", which is a sort of itinerant Christian priest. He has a mysterious past we never really learn about. A brother and sister also come on board. The brother is a highly skilled surgeon and the sister is a genius who had secret experiments run on her by government agents. They are on the run from the same government agents. The other ""permanent"" passenger is a courtesan. She leases one of the ship's shuttles as her place of business. While the crew is doing their thing, she does hers.Much of this series seems like a cowboy picture, right down to the horses, saloons and brothels. In a strange way, it works well in the context of the series. It is well done. I am very sorry that the series was cancelled because it is very good.Synopses of the episodes appear below:Serenity - the crew of the Serenity agrees to pick up a less than legal cargo but gets stiffed on their fee when they try to deliver it. Unless they can find somewhere to sell it, they won't have the cash for parts, fuel, salary or anything else. So they try to less it on some border areas. To help pay the way, they take on some passengers also. One of the passengers turns out to be smuggling a fugitive and another is a federal agent sent to bring in everyone. I get the impression that the government types are not very nice. When you throw in a courtesan, some cannibals and a preacher, things get interesting.The Train Job - This one seems more like a western but doesn't suffer from that. The crew is hired to rob a train on a frontier planet. The goods they are hired to purloin belong to the Federation government so no one really minds or things it is ""wrong"". They also enjoy doing the job right under the noses of Federation troops. The crew doesn't really know what they are stealing. It is only when the train gets to it destination that they learn that they have stolen desperately needed medical supplies. The leads the crew to try to return the goods without getting caught by the feds or the crime boss they were doing job for. This is to be done while the crew is still be pursued by the secret government agency from whom one of the passengers escaped. It's a good and exciting episode.Bushwhacked - While doing nothing in particular, the crew of the Serenity encounter a derelict floating in space. When they go aboard, they find that the crew has been slaughtered by the Reevers (cannibal lunatics) mentioned in the first episode. They left one survivor and a valuable cargo. The crew attempts to help the survivor and salvage the cargo but their efforts are interrupted by a Federation ship. The captain of that ship assumes that it is the crew of the Serenity who committed the atrocities. The crew have to protect themselves, establish their innocence and hide the fugitives who have become passengers.Shindig - The crew returns to the planet Persephone, where the series started. They are looking for business opportunities as usual and a possibility pops up. The captain sees an opportunity for a smuggling run and goes to make contact at a fancy party hosted by the local gentry. To keep this episode interesting, Innarra, the staff courtesan has a date with a local bigwig. He and the captain have a bit of a tiff and wind up in a duel...with swords. There is not a lot of call for swords on spaceships.Safe - In seems that nothing can go right. The crew of the Serenity make planetfall with the consignment of cattle they picked up in the last episode and are about to collect their payment. Then things go wrong as they inevitably must. The local law shows up to arrest the cattle buyers just as the money is changing hands and the crew get involved in the shootout. They help out the law but the parson gets himself shot...very seriously shot. The only two missing from the scene are the two fugitives who have wandered off. The captain thinks they might get in the way of the deal making but now the doctor's services are needed. Unfortunately, he and his sister have gotten themselves kidnapped by some religious types who live in the hills. They are glad to have the doctor but they think the sister is a witch and must burn. Saving the preacher and rescuing the siblings proves to be a sticky situation.Our Mrs. Reynolds - Somehow, we don't really know how, the crew of the Serenity find themselves helping a rural community defend themselves from bandits. After the big celebration, the crew get back on board take of and find that they have an extra passenger. It seems that, according to the local customs, the captain has gotten himself married. That is news to everyone. The young girl is seemingly nave but she is not what she seems. Someone wants the Serenity for scrap.Jaynestown - Jayne Cobb is perhaps the least likeable member of the Serenity crew. He is selfish, not too bright and always ready to fight. He has a long history of leaving planets behind while being on the run. In this episode, the crew sets down to pick up an illicit cargo and Jayne is worried because he knows he left the place on the run. He adopts a disguise. Much to everyone's surprise, everyone learns that Jayne Cobb has become a folk hero to the people on the planet complete with a statue in the public square. All of this came about because of a misunderstanding. He never intended to help those people; he did it by accident but he is still a hero. Heroes have people who don't like them and on this planet that include the local magistrate.Out of Gas - Most series wait until at least the second season before having a retrospective episode. This one takes place halfway through the first season but it has a difference. Instead of recycling footage from old episodes this one has all new footage. The situation involves a serious mechanical failure while the ship is in transit. Life support is failing and the captain sends his crew off in the two shuttles while he stays aboard to try and fix things. While this is going on, we are treated to flashback showing how the crew came to be assembled.Ariel - When the mysterious female passenger with mental problems starts getting worse, her brother the doctor comes up with a seemingly simple scheme to serve everyone's needs. The crew is to help the doc smuggle sis into a hospital for some tests and the doc agrees to help them steal some high dollar drugs to sell on the fringe planets. These are not recreational pharmaceuticals but vital medicines in short supply. The plan seems to work smoothly until treachery becomes apparent.War Stories - In the second episode, the crew is hired to pull a train heist. They pull it off but, when all is said and done, they find that they don't want to keep the goods. The natives need the stolen medications more than the crew needs the money. This is all good and noble and such but it hacks of the crime boss who put them up to it. The crew returned the money but the boss wants revenge. In this episode, he manages to capture the captain and the pilot. It is up to the rest of the crew to get them out.Trash - A few episodes back, the captain got himself accidentally married. The blushing bride turned out to be a con woman and they only barely got away with their lives and their ship. This time, at a Smuggler rendezvous, the captain runs into an old war buddy who happens to have gotten himself married to the same piece of trash. When the story comes out, the wife gets stranded. Captain Mal is about to strand her as well but she manages to talk him into one of her schemes. Naturally, the ""lady"" has an angle of her own. Make that lots of angles...and curves...and treachery. The crew has a few ideas of their own but nothing is going to go as planned.The Message - When the crew stops at a station for a mail call, they get a surprise. A corpse has been mailed to the captain and Zo. The corpse turns out to be an old war buddy. His last request is that the Serenity take him home for burial. Things are not as they seem, however. The corpse is not dead. Instead, he is smuggling body parts and there are other who want the parts, without the rest of the body. As everyone turns on everyone else over conflicting loyalties, the situation gets tense.Heart of Gold - When Inarra, the courtesan, gets a distress call, she talks the crew of Serenity into helping an old friend of hers who is the madam of a bordello on a backwater planet. A local powerbroker with a barren wife want to sire an heir on one of the house girls. He manages to plant his crop and intends to claim it by force. The crew intend to prevent that. And a good time is had by most.Objects in Space - River, the female fugitive, continues to get more and more erratic. This troubles the crew who fear not only for themselves but for her as well.

They're also there to wonder aloud to themselves and each other, &quot;What's the matter with him?&quot;  To which someone usually responds, &quot;I don't know, but there's something about him that I like.&quot;  The thing about those movies (a lot of them came out of the 80's and early 90's, I know because in school we all imitated them), was the the core of those movies was the zany character exploration, and that was just about it.  See what kind of situations we can cook up and then throw this crazed, witty personae in there and see what happens.What's different about Pirates of the Caribbean, and Jack Sparrow in particular, is that the world he inhabits gave birth to him.  In the crazed personae movie--the nut-job seems to come out of nowhere, completely unexpected, which is half the fun but also half the shortcoming.  In Pirates of the Carribean, we expect Jack Sparrow to come sailing out of the horizon and to suddenly arrive in that world, and what a world!I think what lends Sparrow such credibility is his mixture of characterization.  Yes, he's wild and I suppose &quot;free,&quot; but there are moments where he gets serious (saluting the dead pirates), moments when he has to act and can pull through (like jumping in to save Elizabeth), moments where he has to educate (telling Will Turner the truth about his father).  When this happens, we give the character Sparrow something we don't give the hollow, crazed personae; respect.  Give Johnny Depp all the credit for being able to switch between these modes as well; being serious and respectable while maintaining the aura of Jack Sparrow; that he'll stick his tongue out at us and run off with the gold at any moment, but not without his effects.The world of &quot;Black Pearl&quot; is lush and surprising.  I didn't expect to believe the world of pirates, where all the exsists is ocean and the few ports that you can sail to.  Come to think of it, we only really see three locales during the whole movie, and the rest of it is on water.  How'd they pull that off?  My favorite scene is in the pirate pub where the bar-fight is perpetual; Jack Sparrow and his cohort (can't remember his name) sit and talk about ports, treasures, old pirates, schemes, boats, etc. all in the warm glow of candles and wood as they chug ale.  A pirate's life for me!Geoffery Rush, brilliant as ever.  When he says, &quot;Too long have I been without the taste of food or the comfort of a woman&quot; I believe him.  The man is a pirate outright, but in his eyes you can see the years of torment on a man from the curse piling up on him slowly.  Notice too how he rolls his eyes perfectly when he's at the moment of breaking the curse, and somehow Jack Sparrow convinces him not to.  How?  Maybe &quot;Curse of the Black Pearl&quot; is really how Jack Sparrow has dogged Barbossa his whole career.The supporting cast is good, even Orlando Bloom who is still in Legolas mode.  Even though he played up Will Turner nicely as a bright-eyed, talented, somewhat intense young man (who has serious anxieties about his lineage, but why not?  It would bar him from his chances of Elizabeth), I did keep expecting him to jump up and go, &quot;He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn!&quot;  He does have a great moment where he jumps onto a ship with Sparrow and goes, &quot;Aye, avast!&quot; to which he's promptly laughed at.

Directed by Stanley Kubrick, the key to understanding `Full Metal Jacket' is to realise that this is a Kubrick film first and a war film second. Both boot camp and battlefield merely serve as a backdrop for the usual Kubrick themes and ideas, and the final product bears more similarity to `Clockwork Orange' than to other war movies.Being a Stanley Kubrick film, it goes without saying that the technical aspects of `Full Metal Jacket' are almost flawless. Kubrick makes excellent use of pans, long shots, close-ups, and point-of-view, and some of the battle scenes in the second half are given realism by the use of hand-held camerawork. Kubrick also does a good job in set design; using a British army base to substitute for US Marine boot camp was a no-brainer, but amazingly a dilapidated London gasworks was very realistically transformed into the Vietnamese city of Hue.As has been often noted, the film is split into two parts, and in some ways is almost two independent films. The first half, dealing with Marine boot camp, is exceptional. R Lee Emery's performance as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman is terrifyingly realistic, and has to be seen to be believed. His interactions with his ""maggots"", especially his relentless abuse of Private Pyle, are at once hilarious and disturbing. And Vincent Donofrio as the misfit-turned-psychopath Pyle is also outstanding.However, the brilliance of the first half means the second part of the film can fall a bit flat. One big problem is that Hartman and Pyle are the two most interesting characters in the movie, but are absent from the second half, meaning Joker has to carry this part of the film. But Joker is a fairly weak protagonist; he seems designed as an ""everyman"" that we can identify with, but his very ordinariness means he is often overshadowed by more interesting characters such as Hartman, Pyle, and (in the second half) Animal Mother. He's really just a pair of eyes through which we see the war and its effects on men.One way in which `Full Metal Jacket' differs from other war films is that it doesn't have an explicit message. In typical Kubrick fashion, he refuses to settle for easy answers; he presents the characters and events as they are, and forces us to draw our own conclusions. On one hand, the absence of any ""pass the bucket"" flag-waving or preachy anti-war posturing is a welcome relief. But on the other, the rather detached and academic approach of the film can make it difficult to engage with. While there are some powerful scenes, `Full Metal Jacket' lacks the nightmarish feel of `Apocalypse Now', or the strong emotional pull of something like `The Deer Hunter'.In all, `Full Metal Jacket' is a typical Kubrick film, so if you've seen any of his other movies, you'll probably already know whether you'll love it or hate it. Those expecting a gung-ho action fest or a film with a clear ""point"" might be disappointed, but open-minded war movie fans should find this a unique and challenging take on Vietnam.

It once seemed that the size and scale of the books would make it impossible to be adapted into a movie, but Peter Jackson hit every mark right on the nail.  In every essence of this, he stayed true to Tolkien's epic visions of fantasy grandeur.The cast was portrayed perfectly.  There could have been no better an Aragorn than Viggo Mortensen, none as passionate to play Frodo than Elijah Wood.  I loved Sean Bean's performance, he gave his all to the spirit of Boromir, and in the end when he was tempted by the Ring, he was perfect-you could vividly see the turmoil in his eyes, and that is something not often found in an actor.  The elves were made up perfectly-even Galadriel, whose portrayal by Cate Blanchet I was not very fond of.  I enjoyed the hobbits' role as the comedic effect-they did it well.  And Gandalf.

Ian McKellen's role as the wonderful wizard was better than perfect-Gandalf is one of those roles where you can either do it well, or make a complete fool of yourself.

The story is choppy and confusing; the special effects are terrible, even for 1984; and the appearance of the film in general leaves you wondering if the intent was not to make a serious recreation of the novel but rather something campy, like ""Flash Gordon"" -- except that it is much darker, with occasional gory intrusions. What you're left with is basically all the novel's mumbo-jumbo (""Bene Gesserit,"" ""Maud'Dib,"" ""Kwisatz Haderach"") but nothing of the sense you get from the best science fiction of a complete, alternate time and place. In addition, some of the acting is downright terrible, especially Brad Dourif's (Piter de Vries), whoever he is. Sting too, while bringing back memories of his hairstyles from that era, is pretty unconvincing. Poor Max von Sydow cannot but come across well, but he's killed after about 10 minutes on screen. There's really no saving this movie: fans who wanted it to work, and wanted David Lynch to do it well, can maintain that it was brutal editing that caused the problem, but it's just not the case. No amount of additional scenes would have made this a good movie. It is definitely a disappointment. On top of it all, this DVD release (I am reviewing the ""extended version,"" with the theatrical cut on side A and the ""Alan Smithee"" version on side B) looks very poor.

The matter-of-fact discussions about Earth's imminent destruction, our hero and damsel-in-distress somehow instantly falling in love and the inexplicable onset of early jealousy after having only traded about 10 lines of dialogue, the sometimes brilliant lines of dialogue delivered by Max von Sydow (especially how he discusses with Zarkoff why it's HIS fault that Earth is being destroyed), etc., brews an unusual beverage of serial episode fun that was purely misunderstood back when this was released.

This probably contributed greatly to my enjoyment of the film, because the screenwriters largely mangled the plot from both of those books, combining them into one movie. If I had looked forward to the actual QotD plotline, I would've been disappointed.Akasha actually has a relatively small role in the film, and Mekare is entirely absent. Maharet is alive and well in the Mojave Desert. Still, it all comes together, and focuses primarily upon Lestat, his transformation into a vampire, and his career as a rock star (his singing voice is Jonathan Davis, the lead singer from Korn, who is perfect for Lestat.)For those unfamiliar with Rice's books, Lestat is a bad boy, even by vampire standards; he likes to cause trouble, and lots of it. We learn why he has a hard time being a vampire, and what he yearns for most of all. In the first few moments of the film, he awakens from a 100-year nap to find an entirely different world - a world in which he can cope much better. He outs himself as a vampire to the whole world, becomes the biggest rock legend around, and begins giving away the secrets of the vampires living among humans. The other vampires are, needless to say, a bit peeved about this, and they come after him. There are several driving forces in the film - Lestat himself, the covens coming after him, Akasha's awakening and subsequent quest for a lover, and Marius, who in this film is Lestat's sire.While the last 20 minutes are somewhat less than gratifying, the rest of the movie is fairly sound and enjoyable. It felt shorter than it actually was, strangely enough. Large sections of the original plot are left out entirely or are incorrectly depicted, and if one were to focus on that point alone, one would probably not enjoy this movie at all. I went into it with the sole intent of just enjoying a movie that looked like it was very beautiful - and it was.Aesthetically, this film is top-notch. The costumes, make-up and special effects are wondefully done. The acting is very good, and the screenplay itself isn't bad, either. Aaliyah did a fine job as Akasha, and Stuart Townsend was a great Lestat - much, much better than Tom Cruise. The settings are appropriately dark and moody, filled with beautiful sets, sensual people, and a wonderful soundtrack, and there is an almost dreamlike quality to much of the film.The one problem I had with the film was that too much was cut out of it for a lot of details and characters to make a great deal of sense. When many of the ancients arrive on the scene, many questions hung in the air, chiefly &quot;ok, who *are* you guys, and why are you helping this person?!&quot; The DVD features many scenes that were cut, though, and includes notes on why the filmmakers removed them. Many of them help things come into focus more clearly, and it's unfortunate that they were deleted. Perhaps someday, an extended version will be released, reintegrating these scenes.Overall, it was a very enjoyable movie experience, and I think even Anne Rice fans will enjoy it, if they can look beyond the liberties taken with the storyline, and just try to enjoy a vampire movie that's better than most.

He doesn't show his feelings very well and is somewhat of a loner. Jack Twist (played by the equally accomplished Jake Gyllenhaal) is more vocal about his feelings and emotions, but can still be pushed around (although I did enoy it when he stood up to his bigoted father-in-law).What makes this tale so bitter is that their's is a forbidden love. It is reminiscent of ""Titanic"" or Romeo and Juliet. Please keep in mind that the picture took place during 60's, 70's, and early 80's, in Middle-America where no one was openly gay, much less a cowboy. But, despite all their differences and personal demons both men loved each other more than life itself.Anyone with connected eyeballs can tell that Ennis and Twist were deeply in love (this was not an affair, rather it was a serious relationship that lasted over two decades). It was proof that Twist loved Ennis when they were on the hill getting ready to leave after he playfully lassoed and punched Ennis. Twist looked so sad to have intentionally inflicted pain on his lover. But Ennis holed off and punched him, because no one was gonna make Ennis his fool.

Rumors of a 4+ hour adaptation abound and I have to admit, I saw a very long version of this movie on television but I think they just added commmercials to make it long.  Nonetheless, the promise of getting to see some of the previously unseen footage was enough to make me buy.  An interview on this extended DVD set clears up the mystery that there was never enough footage for 4+ hour version --- however this new release does include never before seen footage.I'll tell you what I like about the original:It made me think.  I was a teen when I saw the original movie and I hadn't read the book at that time.  I must say, this movie in its original form forced me to think and read into characters.When you see the original movie, the director did a phenomenal job of adapting the book to a movie and once you read the book you'll see the hard work that was put into this movie in its original form.  Lynch dropped subtle details into the movie that added to the mythology like small comments on thinking machines and how they were frowned upon etc that really made you wonder about this world.  The Orange Catholic bible etc.  Few movies out there and few directors were so careful to add so many small details to this work.  I don't know if Lynch was ever happy with the production but his efforts came through loud and clear to me.  However, due to the volume of work, the audience had to be an interested audience (this is not a hang your brain at door movie)....you have to watch everything and listen to everything because most things have a meaning.About the Flaws people see with this movie:Many people think its incomprehensible....You have to understand that the book Frank Herbert wrote is genius..  It bespeaks of the second coming of Christ only 10,000 years in the future.  The book is over 500 pages and then there are several additional books written by Herbert in the series that create a whole mythology around the world he created.  This is allot of ground for an audience to cover in a couple of hours.To add to this, you have to be versed in Science Fiction, Medieval Feudal Europe, The Catholic Church, Physics, Politics, Current Events (Intifada issues) & Middle Eastern Affairs, Mecantile Europe, Medieval life at court, and have an open mind & inventive mind and knowledge of several other areas.If you don't care for those topics or don't have time to know something about this, then this movie regardless of how they recast the movie, it will be incomprehensible and I recommend you steer well clear of the books as well.On the other hand, with a bit of reading and an open mind, this movie is reachable to most every 15 year old with a basic Western Education.About this Extended Edition ---The good:Getting the opportunity to see some previously unseen footage is worth the price of admission for this extended edition.  They did a good job in knitting the whole story by reslicing the material.  However, I would definitely call it somebody's else's Dune because the recutting definitely gives it a different feel and flavor.The case is slick and exactly what I would expect for a release to a global fanbase for what could be one of the greatest stories ever told.The extended edition is anamorphic widescreen which is a nice treat.  There are some cut scenes that are nice but no commentary or any nicer features that I could see.  They did have some nice interviews on how they did it, special effects, costumes etc that were a nice contextual extras.Now for the Bad:Some people did not like the original cut of movie and in response the studio, I think, tried to make this rendition more comprehensive by making extended edition in the hopes of engaging a wider audience....the original problem remains -- how to feed 6+ hours of details and content into 2 or so hours.In The old movie Urulan introduces the movie perfectly and then you cut to a simple communication between the ""guild"" which has them send a navigator to ""demand"" from the emperor details.  That original introduction was perfect....then you'd cut and see Urulan walk by as the Navigator arrived at the Emperor's palace.  An interraction between the Emperor and the Navigator shed so much light to the original movie and most of the context you need to get through it.In the new adaptation, you start off with an overly long cartoonish explanation that indeed doesn't shed enough light to really state what is at the heart of the problems the imperium faces (details that Lynch expertly peppered into the original with a casual comment here and there already).  Albeit this new intro has some very engaging cartoons, I think its still best to say less and force the audience to think...all the cartoon does is destroy mythology...but don't get me wrong, I appreciate the hard work they did in extending the movie and showing us more.Overall, I think the original movie where Urulan introduces the movie and then the cut to her at court in the original movie is perfect (not to mention that she's gorgeous....gorgeous princess introducing vs voice of some guy?) ---- even the sci fi channel adaptation ends with a beautiful fadeout where Urulan is left alone.  The original can't be beat.On packaging, I would've expected 2 or 3 CDs to go with the gorgesous case for the fans....but instead we get a single CD that you flip to get both versions of the movie.  This should've been 1 original, 1 extended, 1 extras CDs. It seems like they paid for the case and skimped on the CDs...I would've paid $29.99 for better packaging and extras.Overall:Not everyone likes all movies and this one is no different.  I am a believer as other reviewers have noted that Dune is a ""love it or hate it affair."" Indeed I have found this to be the case.  First you have to get this movie and then you have to apprecite it.  Many people don't even get to the ""getting it part"" for whatever reason....because they're turned off by sci fi, the graphic gothic nature of some scenes, or don't know about the various topics you have to know about etc.Personally, I think this extended edition is worth buying just for the extra scenes and some of the special featurettes.  I am however, still a huge fan of the original rendition and prefer it to this extended edition, the extended tv edition, and the sci fi channel miniseries.  I'll visit Lynch's Dune over any other to date. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(6602, 6616)",2,0.0,False

Dashwood's in London).______The missing characters:I personally don't mind the fact that Lady Middleton (& children) were left out (the movie stated Sir John was a widower).In the book, Miss Austen describes her as ""(though perfectly well bred,) she was reserved, cold, and had nothing to say for herself beyond the most common-place enquiry or remark"".With that said, it wasn't that much of a loss to leave her out being that she and Mrs. (John) Dashwood were so much alike (""there was a kind of cold hearted selfishness on both sides, which mutually attracted them; and they sympathized with each other in an insipid propriety of demeanour, and a general want of understanding"").In the book, all she really did was dote on her children, and play hostess.They also left out the other Miss Steel, which wasn't a big deal either.  They just had Lucy out herself to Fanny instead. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3055, 3069)",1,0.0,False

It would become a financial disaster or a goldmine.  And sure enough, ""Avatar"" has become the latter.  The film has grossed over $2.7 billion and with this Blu-ray and DVD release, during the first two days of its sale, it has sold over $5 million copies.Needless to say, this is the easily James Cameron's masterpiece.  Avoiding anything that resembles sci-fi kitsch with the use of its CG and becoming just eye candy, ""Avatar"" is a fantastic film that deserves to be seen and this is coming from a reviewer who was more than caustic towards this film before reviewing this Blu-ray release.VIDEO:""Avatar"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 1:78:1) and is the true definition of reference quality video.  Detail and colors are just amazing.  The close up of the CG work looks so realistic and are so remarkably detailed that it looks as if Cameron and crew have achieved CG perfection.  You see skin pores, the application of the pain on the skin, the sweat glistening on the characters.  How do they do that?  There is amazing detail in land of Pandora as each step and each touch produces this light around a plant or surrounding and the colors just glow and look fantastic in HD.And it just doesn't stop there.  There is detail everywhere.  From the mecha vehicles that Spec-Ops command, the large vehicle units, the creatures on Pandora are shown with a large assortment of colors.This is the best looking film on Blu-ray that has come since the first release of Blu-ray discs.  I know this is a statement that is hard to believe especially with so many fantastic reference quality releases on BD but ""Avatar"" has set the bar up high of how gorgeous a film can look on Blu-ray.  Incredible!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Avatar"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, English Dolby Surround, English Decruption Audio, Spanish, French and Portuguese 5.1 Dolby Digital.  And you think that ""Avatar"" has raised the bar for picture quality, the audio for ""Avatar"" is equally fantastic!Immersive.  This is the word I describe this film as the DTS-HD Master Audio lossless audio track takes control of your soundscape and sound is coming from the front and center channels, surround channels are active throughout the film. May it be the forest ambiance, creatures rustling in the leaves, large animals heard flying above and of course, the pulse-pound action as the LFE is fully engaged.  Expect your subwoofer (and literally all channels) to go on over-drive as the film, especially during the second half of ""Avatar"" makes those scenes come alive.  The vehicles flying and the rotors blowing the trees, missiles firing and causing destruction and trees falling everywhere and the scream of the Omaticaya's as they are losing their home.Again... Incredible!As for subtitles, ""Avatar"" is presented in English SDH, Spanish and Portuguese.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Avatar"" does not come with any special features but more than likely we will see a ultimate edition coming out later this year.EXTRAS:""Avatar"" comes with a slipcase and a DVD version of the film.  The DVD is presented in Widescreen 1:78:1 and Dolby Digital 5.1, English, Spanish and French Dolby Surround.JUDGMENT CALL:When ""Avatar"" was released in theaters, I admit that I took a caustic approach to the film.It's not that dislike James Cameron films because I have enjoyed many of his films but it deals with my feelings of technology and films infused by CG that the more I see a sci-fi film utilizing it to the nth degree, I look at these films as becoming kitsch.  Granted, I'm not expecting the return of thousands of talents and epic filmmaking along the reigns of D.W. Griffith's ""Intolerance"" but when I saw the trailer for ""Avatar"", I was sensing CG eye candy ala ""Transformers II: Revenge of the Fallen"".With so many films being released on 3-D (which I have been told that ""Avatar"" must be seen in 3-D), in some ways, I just want to watch my movies straight.  It's not the 3-D that makes me excited, it's the good ol' fashioned form of cinema.  But with today's technology, for a sci-fi film, I'm expecting a beautiful scenery in this new world, unique characters, good acting, well-paced and a well-written storyline and most of all, because it's James Cameron who has raised the bar with ""Titanic"", I expect the best and not sci-fi kitsch.Of course, ""Avatar"" has gone on to breaking records and fan anticipation of the Blu-ray and DVD release are high (despite the first release being barebones) and upon receiving my review copy, I admit that I was curious about the film.  What will James Cameron bring to the big screen in terms of character development, storyline and what message does he have for the viewer.  Without it becoming an all eye candy film.Well, let's just say that after I watched ""Avatar"", I was blown away.  Yes, ""Avatar"" is eye candy but it's pleasing eye candy that has a strong storyline behind it.  Films such as the ""Star Wars"" or ""Lord of the Rings"" films have been able to take the viewer and let them believe they are away from reality and you know these worlds.  That is why so many decades later, people still know the settings, the surroundings of these films and the same can be said about ""Avatar"".Like those films that will forever be etched in the minds of movie fans, ""Avatar"" will do the same as people will remember the lush world of Pandora, it's creatures but most of all the Na'vi.  Technology is to the point where creatures or other life forms do not need to don a rubber suit or wear excessive make-up to make one think that being is from another planet.  Somehow the wizards were able to take the likeness if Sam Worthington, Sigourney Weaver, Zoey Saldana and make the characters of Jake Sully and his avatar, Neytiri and Dr. Grace Augustine come alive.The detail of this film is amazing.  On Blu-ray, it's fantastic!  The detail and vibrant colors come alive in full effect.  The characters on both the human and Na'vi side are believable and the acting is not forced.  I admit that very early on the film, I thought about the character of Jake Sully (and no offense to Sam Worthington) but we were going to get something similar to Channing Tatum's Duke (""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra"") and deal with a character that was concerned about his own virility and place as a soldier on Pandora but that is not the case.  Worthington's Sully is a man is a disabled man who has found new life using his Avatar, the ability to take part in lifestyle of the Omaticaya, embrace it and find love with Neytiri, the planet and its inhabitants.The chemistry between the characters of Jake Sully and Neytiri is natural but works extremely well.  And for fans of James Cameron films, to see Sigourney Weaver in ""Avatar"" is a nostalgic blessing.  She may not be as forceful as her character of Ripley in the ""Alien"" films but her role as Dr. Grace Augustine was well-done.In fact, I felt the movie and it's pacing for a longer film was well-done, the viewer is immersed in the world but also gets to see political corruption and greed come to play and how Cameron is able to work this film and make it exciting and believable underneath all the CG is quite amazing.  What the ""Star Wars"" films were to me back in the late '70s and early '80s, ""Avatar"" was a film that captivated my attention throughout its 162 minutes and made me appreciate what sci-fi films today can accomplish (granted, not many films will ever get the budget that Cameron was able to achieve with this film).But as this film has received mostly positive reviews, I was surprised to read ""Salon"" critic Stephanie Zacharek's opening paragraph of her review.  Zacherek writes, ""The problem with taking 15 years to bring audiences the future of filmmaking is that someone else is bound to get to the future before you do. And while there are certain technical effects in James Cameron's ""Avatar"" that aren't quite like anything we've ever seen before, the movie is hardly a historical event, or even a grand achievement. It is  a very expensive-looking, very flashy entertainment, albeit one that groans under the weight of clumsy storytelling in the second half and features some of the most godawful dialogue this side of `Attack of the Clones'.""I disagree with Zacharek's comment of the movie is a grand achievement.  The film has broken box office records worldwide and now has its place in the record books as the #1 earning film in the world.  Granted, for critics...many probably didn't think early on that James Cameron could repeat his box office success that he did with ""Titanic"", let alone beat that record with a sci-fi film.  But he did and if that is not an grand achievement, I don't know what Zacharek was expecting. Even if you remove yourself from the earnings, the CG work is amazing.  The cinematography is amazing and just the amount of detail on the characters at this time is phenomenal.  And when you think about its competition during the Oscar year, ""Avatar"" was deserving in winning ""Best Achievement in Art Direction"", ""Best Achievement in Cinematography"" and ""Best Achievement in Visual Effects"".She goes on to say that the film was under the weight of clumsy storytelling in the second half and like many sci-fi films, there must be action.  You know early on that there is a war coming between the humans and the Na'vi.  It's expected, it's going to happen and yes, you are going to lose some of that emotional connect through those sequences.  And the ""godawful dialogue"", I did mention this earlier on in my review that I felt that the character of Jake Skully was getting near Channing Tatum's Duke but for ""Avatar"", it works. Skully is introduced in the beginning as someone completely opposite of his intellectual brother and it shows.But similar to Zacharek, I was surprised that ""Village Voice"" critic J. Hoberman would feel the same about the second half as well.  Hoberman writes, ""For the first 45 minutes, I'm thinking: Metropolis!--and wondering how to amend ballots already cast in polls of the year's best movies. Then the 3-D wears off, and the long second act kicks in.""I found the comment to be quite interesting and for the most part, I can see where Hoberman is coming from in comparisons of both films.  Where the Fritz Lang epic featured a man from the upper-level associating with and underground woman in which the underground has been subjective to corporate corruption to its highest level, I see the connection but at the same time, comparing ""Metropolis"" and ""Avatar"" is comparing apples to oranges.  Where both films feature a revolt, ""Metropolis"" denizens have lived their monotonous life the same every day and are not warriors.  In ""Avatar"", the Na'vi are losing their homeland, their planet is being destroyed and they have either the choice to give up and move to another area or fight.  And what kind of film would ""Avatar"" be if we watched these warriors being displaced?The second half needed that battle and like ""Metropolis"", where Freder joins Maria in the grand fight, Sully joining the Na'vi was just right!  That battle needed to be epic and for an audience who have sat that long at the theater for something grand to happen, this was their pay off. Yes, the film is pragmatic but for a sci-fi film, it works and definitely not kitsch.So, I came away enjoying ""Avatar"" much more than I expected.  The Blu-ray delivered in picture and audio quality.  Special features are none but similar to ""Sin City"" which came out with a near barebones DVD release was then given a magnificent Blu-ray release much later and it's expected the same will happen to ""Avatar"".  I am sure like the video releases of ""Titanic"" and ""Terminator 2', Cameron has a lot of planned for the upcoming ultimate or special edition of ""Avatar"".  This release was just to satisfy the masses who have enjoyed the film and definitely looks and sounds incredible in HD.I know many people may hold off until the better version of ""Avatar"" is released on Blu-ray but for now, if you want to enjoy ""Avatar"" now, you can.  James Cameron's ""Avatar"" is the best looking film on Blu-ray since the release films on Blu-ray disc.  Although, this is not the ultimate release of ""Avatar"" and does not include any special features, in terms of picture and audio quality alone, ""Avatar"" has not only broken box office records, it has raised the bar on what perfection looks and sounds like on Blu-ray.Highly recommended!

Hi, I have finally decide to start being a reviewer again, considering that my last one was for SummerSlam '11. This event had 3 matches that I was extremely excited about. I hate long intros so lets go to the review.1. World Heavyweight Championship Match:Daniel Bryan(c) vs. Sheamus (0:18)Not alot of people should have expected much from this match but 18 SECONDS!!!! OK, I don't understand why they would even put this match first. Last year, there was supposed to be a US Championship Match between these men, but it made the pre-show, lasted 2 minutes then ended in a no-contest. To make up for it, the match was made a main event but it felt like once again barely made the card. I won't spoil it, but it is what it is.  No rating.2. Randy Orton vs. Kane (10:56)I knew this match would be good. This was a match worth watching, and it can be acceptable for a WM match. It had a decent pace, nice back-and-forth maneuvers, and took up a fair time slot. Nice and unsuspecting ending, not much more. 8/103. Intercontinental Championship:Cody Rhodes(c) vs. Big Show (5:18)At least this match was better than expected. It was no squash, and it had fair back-and-forth pace, for a match like this. Watc it or not, still alright, 7/104. Beth Phoenix and Eve vs. Maria Menounos and Kelly Kelly (6:49)I normally say that these matches suck, but I liked it. 7.5/10 4 Matches in and were not even done with the first hour5. Hell in a Cell Match ""The End of an Era""The Undertaker vs. Triple H (Shawn Michaels as Special Guest Referee)(30:52)The world was waiting to see how Undertaker would fight his 20th match at WM,and I have the answer; BALD! HIAC was a good touch to this match, its too bad this match was slow. Trust me, I liked it, and this isn't negative, but it's not like HBK vs. Taker at WrestleMania XXV. The match last year was bvery good, which gave more hype to this match. Problems included, slow pace, and little use of different weapons. 9/106. Santino Marella, R-Truth, Kofi Kingston, Booker T, The Great Khali and Zack Ryder (Team Teddy) vs.David Otunga, Dolph Ziggler, Mark Henry, Jack Swagger, The Miz and Drew McIntyre (Team Johnny)(10:38)It's about time they included a 12-man tag Match at WM, I don't havve much to say about this match, can't give away every match. 8/107. WWE Championship Match:CM Punk(c) vs. Chris Jerciho (22:21) ""YES! YES! YES!"" Sorry, wrong match. Anyway, fantastic match. Way better than expected, and that's saying something. This match was inside, outside, back, forth, pin, submission, kicking out, reaching ropes, so much action. The storyline of Jericho making fun of Punk's family didn't suprise me. But, anyway, this match rocked! Two submission and high-flying specialists fighting to determine the ""Best in the World"" made this great. Everything did. 9/108. ""Once in a Lifetime"" Singles MatchThe Rock vs. John Cena (30:34)The most hyped-up wrestling match in history. A whole year ago, it was announced, and I have waited just that long. All of the Rock Bottoms to Cena before this match were pretty much equal to the amount in this match, same with Attitude Adjustments. This was face-paced and amazing. Memorable moments were at the beginning when one side of the the crowd chanted ""Lets Go Cena"" and the other side chanted ""Cena Sucks"" similar to WM 18. The ending was great also, I suspected it, but I doubt that a lot of people did. This match was worth the year. Could be Match of the Year, lets see if 2012 goes as good as '11 did. 9.5/10In the end, I did give this event 4 stars, I decided to bump this up because I think people will enjoy this more than I have, it seems like that already happened. In one night, we had 3 major Match of the Year Candidates. It's nice to know Rock at least won, then left.I doubt changing my review will affect anything, so if your'e reading, it's your opinion.  I reccomend buying just about every Mania, except for 27, just watch the No Holds Barred Match.

From humble beginnings, birthing slowly in the unlit corner of the one bedroom apartment and rising from the cheap laminate desk of Richard Matheson -- this character seemed destined for greatness. Theoriginal storyreads painfully, is half cheese, half camp ... but strains the eyes continuously, and has a feel to it that is quite moving and worthy of film, graphic novel or some other type of legacy yet unknown.It would seem unlikely that this movie could be compared in anyway to the original short story / novella that shares the same title. In fact, the title might just be the only similarity. My Chinese wife, when she heard about them remaking this - yet again, said: ""Robert Neville is very repetitively described as a blonde haired, blue eyed white man in the book. Will Smith? I gotta see that."" Needless to say, the horror and action fan that she is, she was heavily disappointed in this as it seemed to be its own entity, instead of sharing even the most remote similarity with the book or even the previous films in any way conceivable.I guess it would be foolish to state that this is the only film to have deviated so far, but we all know that isn't the truth by a long shot.The Omega Man,The Running Man,Total Recall,Minority Reportand evenBlade Runnerall differ from their original source material - some heavily while others subtly. Who's to say whether this practice is right or wrong? Some of these films are blockbusters while others are heavily dated and total flops. Apparently, Matheson, not only approved of this version, but stated that he thought it was the best so far. Maybe he was referencing the size of the licensing contract and repetitive royalty amounts, surely he couldn't be favouring this over the Charleton Heston version.But what is it about Hollywood that seems to believe that good books just don't translate onto the screen? All the films I previously mentioned are decent books that would've made good direct adaptations, and I can say this confidently because the adjusted adaptations were nothing memorable or impacting, all with the exception of Blade Runner. Giving credit where credit is due,Forrest Gumpmade an interesting adaptation from a sub-par book to an excellent film.  But this type of foolish recklessness is unfortunately more prevalent in the Science-Fiction genre when it comes to adaptations.When I saw this movie at Target, it was on sale for $15.99, but beside it was another version for $24.99 that had the `controversial ending'. So, now, we must either pay an extra ten bucks to see the version where the Vampire Zombies have any level of noticeable intellect and show a glimmer of cunning, or we end up getting both versions for $35, because we just HAVE to see the other version. They used to market these `other versions' for two or three dollars more, which I used to have no problem with, but this is just unforgivable. Double-dipping is understandable in some cases, like with `Donnie Darko'. Numerous years passed until the Director had a chance to make his desired corrections, and when they were made,another DVDwas released. What `I Am Legend' is trying to do is just foolish. The alternate ending is not worth the ten dollars, so save your money. And, sigh ... don't worry what I just told you is nothing close to a spoiler. So if you haven't seen any of the films or ever read the book, you're none the wiser, but hopefully a little more informed.I also found the use of the soundtrack was superficial and annoying. A lot of opportunities were wasted on this film, the soundtrack is probably one of the biggest ones, as it could've equated into more revenue for the producers and distributors of this let down. `28 Days Later', a film that really raised the bar on these type of `chaos reality' films, has a groundbreaking soundtrack with even a few tracks (18 and 20) that are deeply reminiscent of the score that was used in `The Omega Man' and were quite moving. The majority of James Newton Howard's score wasn't even used in the film. The film was overwrought with so much Foley nonsense (action, explosion, sound effects) that the actual composition for this movie had been dialed into the off position or forgotten about entirely. Shame on the mix done in post by the sound board hacks guzzling diet Pepsi. James Newton Howard may have attempted to repeat his success here from the `Batman Begins' soundtrack, but apart from a few memorable moments, the majority of the musical score here is just way too slow, boring and very forgettable.Since I've noted `28 Days Later', let me just say that that `film' probably had a lot of creative impact on this `movie' from its inception or first utterance of ""let's remake `The Omega Man'"". `28 Days Later' and `28 Weeks' later recouped more money than either of their primary budgets, thus sending signals to Hollywood, that these types of films would essentially be good vehicles for their leading stars. The problem here is that even though you put bankable stars into a bankable idea it doesn't necessarily equate to a success. Also '28 Days Later' is probably the high water mark of all horror zombie films. Danny Boyle set the bar so high that other imitators will likely fail to even come within groveling distance.This movie's major flaws were the deviation in the writing and not adhering to enough of the other films or the original novella. Reciting lines from `Shrek' when confronted with other survivors was also another poor use of story, viewer time and appreciation of the material or the genre. The use of the mannequins was a nice touch to the creepy, artsy feel that was readily prevalent in `The Omega Man' but it just wasn't enough to admit that it's a worthy adaptation. These writers need to be sent to the unemployment office -- asap. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(5877, 5891)",1,0.0,False

This is one.  The initial few scenes are a bit grainy, but I think it was due to the limitations of shooting from a portable camera from a helicopter in 1959.  I'll forgive the grain.  But once the scenes move to the amazing expanses of the Austrian countryside I was blown away.  The clarity is phenomenal.  Even sparkles on the water were vivid.  Plus, the sound is amazing as well.  Bravo on the Blu-Ray.Of note:  this set apparently did not generate as much interest initially so the price has dropped.  I picked it up in the gold box for $18.99.  I have noted the contents and whether they are worthy:4 disc collection: film on Blu-Ray with some features (including a sing along version!), another Blu-Ray of special features, the DVD film version, and a CD soundtrack.The music box plays ""My Favorite Things"" but it plays a bit fast.  It is small-ish, maybe 3"" x 2"" x 2"" or so.  But it has space for some rings or a locket or some other 'favorite thing'.  It says hand painted, but it looks like it was painted from a stencil.  It is a stoneware style, so that is nice.The two books are the great additions to the set.  They have a special feature book (soft cover) and then a production bio (hardcover).The last things are a certificate of authenticity and some post cards.The entire set comes in a stiff cardboard box with a cardboard sleeve around it.  You can remove the sleeve (which has a couple of small pictures showing the contents) and the inner box is clean and looks like the picture.All in all a great set for fans of the film.  For under $20 it is one of the best finds I stumbled across this holiday season.  Even at $30 it is worthy.  If you don't care for the extras, there is a Blu-Ray special edition that is basically the movie with the 3 discs (not including soundtrack):The Sound of Music (Three-Disc 45th Anniversary Blu-ray/DVD Combo in Blu-ray Packaging).

Maybe it was a sequel too far. Maybe I got older, maybe the characters weren't as interesting, or maybe the films just got more and more ridiculous. By 1999, when Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace came along, I had had enough of that George Lucas world a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. In this latest installment of his tired series, Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones, I was disappointed to find no image, no line of dialog, that didn't disappear from my memory as soon as it dissolved from the screen.Oh, yes, Episode II is a technical marvel: here, the sets are totally computer-generated; the aliens are truly inventive and all computer-generated; the visual effects are seamless and brilliantly computer-generated. I even liked seeing tiny Yoda dancing with his light saber in battle with the evil Count Drac-, er, Count Dooku (played with CGI face by Christopher Lee!). But I felt double-crossed by the dialog and cheated by the characters. Ewan McGregor as the young Obi-Wan Kenobi - played memorably in Episodes 4-6 by the late Sir Alec Guinness - was at least entertaining to watch. But the love dance between the maturing Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) and the Princess Padm&eacute; Amidala (Natalie Portman, who actually has talent) was entirely bland and unconvincing. Get a clue, kids: love means passion.The Star Wars franchise George Lucas created inhabits a godless-yet-spiritual universe, with an uneasy alliance between technology and a pop-theology. Among people made uncomfortable by human progress and the dizzying advance of technology, perhaps this is more comfortable - also more masculine, that is, more appealing to male teenagers and less intellectually demanding - than the more explicitly god-free universe of Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek, however cool it is to see Jedi priests swing their light sabers. Personally, I prefer Trek to Wars, principally because I see more potential for improving the human condition with technology than with theology - even the generic, anti-intellectual, anti-technology, anti-progress variety called The Force.That is my objection to Star Wars in general. As to Attack of the Clones in particular, I see Lucas's deep investment in Computer-Generated Imagery (CGI) that might as well be cartoons for all they help the film. I am not opposed to CGI per se. But I do think it should work to elucidate, not invalidate, the story and the characters. The subtitle contains less poetry than truth.

Both are also psychological thrillers.  But the plots and details are very different.In Flight Plan, there are not flying on just ""any"" airlplane.  It is the new two story plane that is the worlds largest which in reality will start flying this year.  Jodie Foster's character is no ordinary person.  She is a propulsion engineer who had a big role in designing the plan.  Where Red Eye takes an average flight with (apparently) average people and puts them in a great plot, Flight Plan makes the lead character a powerful person.  To me this is a negative.  I'm sure the fact that she is an engineer, a job which few women hold, helped its political correctness score.But back to the movie.  I gave it four stars because it was very entertaining.  But like so many have said, it falls apart on closer scrutiny.  Wouldn't SOMEONE have seen or noticed the little girl coming on the plane?  Wouldn't someone have seen her being taken?  The ""plot"" had been planned out so thoughtfully by the antagonist (the air marshall), but what would have happened to the plan to take the girl if Foster's character had not fallen asleep.  There are only some of the problems with the movie.A strong part of the movie is that it sets up a very dreadful mood on the plane.  We can almost feel the emotions that Foster is feeling.  I could almost put myself in her position under those cicumstances.  One reviewer (not to give away more info. but I assume most people reading this review have already seen the movie) mentioned that the movie seemed to be going in the direction that she WAS dillusional and there really was no girl to being with.

The CGI , as well as the 3D technology infused, were by far the best I have ever seen.  James Cameron and all of the people who participated in the making of this movie did a tremendous job.  Weta workshop is taking its place at the top of the mountain, as far as visual effects companies go.  Watching this movie was like being transported to a different universe.  I was completely immersed throughout the almost three hours I was in the theater.As for the story and acting for the film, I am probably in the minority on most of these reviews.  The story for me, while predictable and reminiscent of other movies I'd seen previously (What movie isn't nowadays?), was extremely enjoyable.  Watching this made me feel young again.  It made me forget about all the worries that an adult life brings, and just enjoy myself in the moment.  Many people argue that the acting in this movie was subpar.  These people say that the portrayals of the characters were downright cartoonish.  I would argue strongly against that.  For the type of movie that this is, the good versus evil portrayals given by the actors works in the movie's  favor.  Sam Worthington especially does well.  If you haven't seen him in Terminator: Salvation, do so.  He made the movie worth watching.Now, to get to the actual product at hand.  I ordered the Blu Ray / DVD combo pack from Amazon.  From the moment the menu came onto my screen, I knew this was going to be something special.  When I pressed play, there was no turning back.  Over the next three hours, my senses were completely assaulted and my mind was dumbstruck.  Simply put, James Cameron's Avatar on the Blu Ray format is the best picture and audio we have seen or heard to date.  I have a feeling it will be years before anything better is brought to the table.  Watching the visuals was more stimulating than looking at a real life forest.  Every detail could be seen from far and away.  The walls of my house shook, and I just hope the neighbors did hear.  I would tell them to buy the movie themselves and experience it.With this release comes certain issues.  While I don't have any of them myself, I will still talk about them as it would be uninformative of me to not.  This release of Avatar is not in 3D.  Many people complain about this, and a large percentage of those people do not even have the right equipment to properly experience 3D yet.  The technology for home theater 3D is very new and very pricey.  Next year, after all the quirks have been worked out, is when we will likely see Avatar in a home release 3D format.  Another gripe is the complete lack of special features.  This again has a good reason.  In the Special Edition coming later this year, there will be scenes incorporated into the movie not even visually completed yet.  Documentaries in high definition have to be put together.  A commentary track needs to be recorded.  No one is being forced to buy this ""stripped"" edition, however. I am one of the people who will knowingly double or triple dip on this.  The reason for that is because I love it so much.Now to the biggest complaint.  During the initial release, many people were complaining that Avatar would not play in their Blu Ray players.  The reason for that seems to be some new copy protection put on the disc.  While I was not one of the people with this problem, I can certainly sympathize with those who did.  A new firmware update is all it will take to fix the issue.  My PS3, which serves as my Blu Ray player, had a firmware update ready for me before I watched the movie.So if you are one of the millions who loved Avatar when you saw it in theaters, or one of the people who didn't get around to seeing it, now is your time.  Pick this movie up right away without hesitation.  Keep an open mind, and let yourself become immersed.  You do not want to miss what many people believe is one of the top movies of all time.

While the movie was visually appealing (it looked pretty amazing in point of fact) the story seemed rushed. Almost as if it could have benefited from an extra 30 minutes of scenes added in (I can only assume the typical Hollywood Dougs didn't think people would wanna watch a 3 plus hour long movie) to stretch out the story better and make things seem less like happenstance. I thought the premise and concept were great, I thought the effects and design were great, I just think the execution was not great. It seemed like something was missing, and even though I found the movie enjoyable and a good modern horror sci-fi film much in the vein of Alien, I think this movie could have used an extended cut to draw out sequences and segue one scene to the next more smoothly as I felt some of the transitions were choppy. I could even see this being better as a 6 episode miniseries as the concept was to big for the length of the film. On Blu-Ray, Twentieth Century Fox puts out another immaculate transfer of a movie, it pops onscreen and is one of the best and most detailed releases I've seen to date. And with a 3 and a half hour making of, the special features are great. Well worth the $25 bucks. Aside from the pacing problems, I wish the design was a bit more plain and a bit more 1970's like Alien. Although I really like the design in this movie, in Alien the computer screens were green and simple (because that's what computers looked like in 1979 and movie magic couldn't really enhance that like it can today since the advent of CGI) and costumes weren't as sleek as this movie which makes some distance between them, continuity wise.

It delivered the goods for everyone waiting to check back in with the rough-and-tumble Dr. Henry Jones, (junior ... ahem). But having grown up with Indiana Jones, I've already gotten past the Lucas Factor of being let down long ago. I hung my head in shame after I scurried home from the theatre after seeing 'The Temple of Doom' back in 1984. I wish I had missed that film altogether, even to this day. Needless to say there is a section of this film which I find down-right embarrassing and the Cthulu call for George Lucas.Crystal Skull takes a nose dive during the 'Jungle Chase' scene which seems to be action filler so Cate Blanchett and Shia LeBeouf can rack up some screen-time minutes or perhaps fill a quota or a  contractual agreement with the producers. Whatever it was, it was not just the slowest part of the movie but also the most unnecessary and the biggest reminder, or throw back to The Temple of Doom, thus far. Going over cliffs was well covered in parts two and three, but now we have to revisit it again just so we can add to the run time.I do realize that it was just framework to the very interesting fight-action sequence with the ants which was cool and had a nostalgic feel to it. I think that kind of action is what people tuned in for, but what came before it in the ten minutes previous and the next ten minutes after, should have been left in the editing hard-drives.The 'Jungle Chase' scene though, more directly is classic Lucas faire. He's probably covered this same ground in almost every film he's ever done. A lot of people have complained loudly about just this sort of thing spoiling the Star Wars franchise. So why bother to do it again? The scene of a young fighter precariously hanging on to some shaky edifice, fighting for his life with legs splayed akimbo, desperately trying to fend off his enemy and move the story forward with some type of sword fight. Sigh ... please.How many times did we see this stuff in Episode I, II and II? Too many. It only seemed that Lucas began to learn his lessons by the third film, which was already too late as he had alienated his core audience and even most adults. His interest in his Lego Land contracts and peddling to toddlers always looked to interfere with his real filmmaking, unlike Spielberg who never pandered or bowed full-bend to the marketing aspect of these productions never forgetting that the reason for the film was not the toys.So why Spielberg would let this kind of element creep in and slow down such a good movie is beyond me. Maybe he just can't tell the guy, his good friend, George -- that what he's 'seeing' isn't that great after all. We saw this same element in Jedi, which killed the movie and now he pulls it out once more. At least you can see that Spielberg learned a few things over the years with some of his other movies, by using the absurd to insert his heroes into history like inForrest Gumpin the 'Doom Town' sequence.In all honestly, this film is a perfect candidate for fanedit dot com. A place where film editors, some professional, some work-man, anonymously re-edit films removing certain scenes or offending elements, tightening them up and making them better movies in most cases. A good example of work done through fan edit wasBlade III(retitled 'Kill The King'). All instance of Hannibal King, aka Ryan Reynolds is completely removed. Having seen the movie, I can tell you without doubt it's leagues better than the studio release.I thought I had seen everything in film, but watching Dr. Jones step into the refrigidaire and close the door on himself in order to avoid a nuclear blast was pretty riveting to say the least and very inventive. It's exactly this kind of chess-playing in the writing that most people are hoping to see. The scene where Indy crests over the berm and is face to face with the mushroom cloud is a great piece of film-making. For the last two years I've been seeing artificial CG renderings of atomic and nuclear bomb blasts showing up on blogs and littering youtube, now I know why and where they came from. Some people were put-off by this and cried foul, but every element in this franchise is over the top. Trying to ground it in Christopher Nolan workman-style realism is foolish. Are you paying attention?Upping the ante at this point in the film was pretty genius as well as wiley, making room for excellent long-range planning. Immediately after the radioactive scrub down, we learn that Dr. Jones, is ... gasp ... an Army General ... and then a member of OSS ... gasp! ... and later a double-agent within the CIA. The back story that was built up lends this whole franchise to now be reinvented and the older adventures of theYoung Indiana Jonesto be forgotten and revisited, probably picked up as Dr. Jones runs through a secret trap door from Hitler's Bunker with a smoking gun, not played by Shia LeBeuf, but possibly some as of yet unknown. The writers scored a big plus here and I'm sure Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy were very happy when they read that portion of the script.The ending of the film where the mantle doesn't pass, yet, is probably the question both George Lucas and Steven Spielberg have been batting around themselves. Who will take over my life's work, when my hair is too gray, too thin, my time too short and my interest in the job too waning? You have to wonder who exactly has been groomed to carry on all those unfinished projects, the war adventures of Indiana Jones being apart of that probably massive pile.The Fifth and likely conclusion to this franchise in this era is already being discussed, planned and will probably be announced sometime in March of 2009. Harrison Ford is close to 70 now so time is of the essence in every aspect. The directors are older, too as are the producers. The question of handing his whip & pistol over is a tricky one. Edging out the hero from a franchise has proven fatal before. Yes, back to Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer we go.There was a time in Hollywood when studios no longer wanted to bankroll and produce comic book action movies because a long string of failures that had almost bankrupted several studios in the mid-nineties. A few actually folded. Then along came Wesley Snipes andBlade. It's no secret that Blade reinvigorated the genre and thus the current generation, singularly, owes him a debt of gratitude greater than his IRS burden or the value of Ed McMahon's home. Blade made a lot of money and gave both the confidence and greenlight to other movies that in turn did well and made money.But one day, David Goyer disagreed with Wesley Snipes like a bad episode of House MD and broadcast it unfairly from the rooftops, thus Alienating our favorite Vampire Killer. Wesley didn't think Vampire Hunters teaming up with him was a good idea or that the Vampire Hunters should be teenagers. It sounded good, because after all Vampire films started off with stuff likeCaptain Kronos - Vampire Hunter, again -- it sounded good. But, Wesley openly disagreed with the direction of the franchise and was ignored. It didn't go well, neither did the movie. But I mentioned this already, didn't I? In this scenario, with Harrison Ford, there is no disagreement, but the problem is the same. The studio needs to extricate its hero and find a way to continue without being a clich&eacute;. All I can say is: Good luck, folks.Overall, this story covers a lot of ground, and perhaps in retrospect, maybe too much. Maybe the flaw of this film was giving the audience too much to chew on. I was happy to see Cate Blanchett in something other than a period costume drama of either Elizabeth or a depression era redressing of Katherine Hepburn. I felt the film time that she was given was adequate (minus the 'Jungle Chase') and  her character was more than fleshed out for the escapist action drama that we were all sinking into. Sometimes not overstating a character gives the character more power. Look at Julianne More asMaude Lebowskiwho has little screen time compared to Walter or The Dude, but she has one of the most memorable modern film roles in recent history. Who doesn't remember the line: 'Do you like coitus, Jefferey?'You don't need to beat a viewer over the head in order to make a point. I think we all got the evil persona that she was after the Area 51 scene. Doctor-Professor was a nice touch. Look for it soon in the next Pixar flick. Blanchett's period costume though left much to be desired as she looked more like Lara's work-camp daughter fromDoctor Zhivagothan she ever did as a female version of Dr. Evil in her gray and unappealing jumpsuit. Trying to work us on a seductive Madame Blavatsky angle was good and quite interesting and probably factual to period maniacs of the time, but they overplayed her hand and dashed the project into the rocks that they thought were heading for, all in the drama.Also, as much as I like Ray Winstone, (Sexy Beastis a masterpiece), I felt that his addition was overwrought and unnecessary. Somehow his whole presence seemed very last-minute, maybe his role had something to do with the script leak. Maybe. Maybe not.The ending is quite good. The whole story arc of Roswell, Area 51, General Jones comes together nicely and is probably one of the few times in blockbuster cinema where the subject matter is dealt with in an interesting manner and not treated as an off-handed joke. Knight's 'Signs' was an interesting mix of fundamental religion versus new-age lore and was treated well there. It was handled with equal skill here.Maybe, with a few more viewings and a couple of sit-downs with the commentary track (ahem ... next DVD version of course, as this one doesn't have one), my thoughts will develop and change, but until then, I think I've gilded the Lilly to the point of wilting..... ....

I finally decided four just could not be justified, so it's really more like 3.5/5 from me. So, as you know by now, this is not a great movie, but it's better than Episode I by a considerable margin.  The special effects are great and seamless (moments in Episode I and especially the ones added to the 3 original SW films were quite flawed). The asteroid chase and rain planet and Yoda's lightsaber duel were all memorable. I noticed some grainy scenes in the theater, but everything looks good -- almost TOO good -- on the DVD. The plot this time around is less convoluted and more coherent and flows more naturally from scene to scene. The video and surround audio are both reference quality on this DVD, and there's enough extras to keep the most ardent fans busy for a long time. 'Nuff said about that -- no complaints at all there.But alas, the characters and their interactions with each other, is the film's downfall, due to poor acting, directing, and screenwriting. I appreciated trying to add some romantic facets, but the dialogue is laughably bad in many scenes, and certain actors are so blandly disinterested they cannot overcome the material to convince us otherwise. Hayden Christiansen is simply awful, there is no other way to put it. The annoying, forgettable, hokey child actor in Episode I has been replaced by an annoying, forgettable, hokey teenage actor here. Natalie Portman is only slightly less wooden than in Episode I, which must be blamed on the direction, because in other places she's proved herself to be a competent actor. And although I generally like him, I never quite bought Samuel Jackson as a Jedi Knight. He goes through the entire film with an odd look on his face and I get the distinct feeling he was always on the verge of breaking into laughter reading his lines. Christopher Lee and Ewan McGregor are the only actors worthy of the roles, along, of course, with the vocal talent that gives the CG Yoda life. Thankfully the insipid Jar Jar Binks is less prominent in this film, although even after five seconds he begins to grate on you. I guess he had to put in an appearance so they could pump another action figure into Toy 'R' Us stores around the world. As for the direction, Lucas needs to just give it up and let someone who knows what they are doing handle it. He is NOT a great director. His two best films, Empire and Raiders, were directed by someone other than him. There was some great screen chemistry in the original Star Wars but it must have just been stars-aligning dumb luck, since he has never been able to reproduce it since.Reading this you might think I hated this movie, but I actually didn't. You just need to let yourself become a kid again for a few hours and ignore the bad things. Then it just becomes fun, and if you are expecting something more from a Star Wars film then you aren't being realistic. The first three Star Wars films also had lots of bad acting, bad screenwriting, uneven direction, cheesy special effects, and a ridiculous plot but we never saw that, because we were young and unjaded and had no preconceptions or expectations for the films to live up to, and we were experiencing instead of analyzing as we watched.

Almost as if it could have benefited from an extra 30 minutes of scenes added in (I can only assume the typical Hollywood Dougs didn't think people would wanna watch a 3 plus hour long movie) to stretch out the story better and make things seem less like happenstance. I thought the premise and concept were great, I thought the effects and design were great, I just think the execution was not great. It seemed like something was missing, and even though I found the movie enjoyable and a good modern horror sci-fi film much in the vein of Alien, I think this movie could have used an extended cut to draw out sequences and segue one scene to the next more smoothly as I felt some of the transitions were choppy. I could even see this being better as a 6 episode miniseries as the concept was to big for the length of the film. On Blu-Ray, Twentieth Century Fox puts out another immaculate transfer of a movie, it pops onscreen and is one of the best and most detailed releases I've seen to date. And with a 3 and a half hour making of, the special features are great. Well worth the $25 bucks. Aside from the pacing problems, I wish the design was a bit more plain and a bit more 1970's like Alien. Although I really like the design in this movie, in Alien the computer screens were green and simple (because that's what computers looked like in 1979 and movie magic couldn't really enhance that like it can today since the advent of CGI) and costumes weren't as sleek as this movie which makes some distance between them, continuity wise.

The flying rock mountains, the fluorescent plantlife and animals, the soaring flying scenes are all just fantastic.  And of course, coming from the creator of the first two ""Terminator"" movies, the action scenes are first rate and terrifying.The storyline is a very recognizable one that is often repeated in American cinema.  The story is basically a combination of ""Pocahontas"", ""Dances With Wolves"",  ""Fern Gully: The Last Rainforest"", ""Dune"", ""Tarzan"", and lots of other similar tales of a young man's journey into heroism,  rising from nothing to become a powerful leader/defender of another people, another world.  And along this journey, the young man meets the female who will be his devoted mate for life.  The story has echoes of Joseph Campbell and ""The Power of Myth"",  with the added post-modern, post-Title IX twist of the female saving the life of our hero at the end.The fact that this story resonates so deeply in American culture is simply a reflection of its importance in early American history, as this was not a myth based on white guilt, but a true story and common occurrence.  In the early days of contact between white settlers and Indians, many young white men did in fact choose to run away from their repressive European cultures to the free and open Indian societies,  often taking an Indian woman as a wife.  Sam Houston, a hero of Texas, was but one such example of a young man who ran away to live with the Indians, taking an Indian wife along the way;  Houston did go on to lead not the Indians, but the Texans, to freedom.And as pointed out in the book ""1491"", it was this interaction between white settlers and the Indian tribes that fundamentally shaped the character of early Americans, transforming the rigid and hidebound hierarchies of their European origins into the egalitarian and libertarian ideals of Indian culture.Supposedly, James Cameron took four years to make this movie.  It shows in the facial features of Sam Worthington who was only 31 when he was first cast and looks noticeably younger and more baby-faced in some of the scenes compared to others.I kept thinking back to when the last time was that I had seen such lush and powerfully creative fantasy images - so much of the background scenery from this movie could stand on their own as superb fantasy artwork, suitable for framing.  It has been a really long time - not since the fantastic artwork of Frazetta and others in the 1970's have I seen such beautiful fantasy artwork.  And so in the end, it was not the much-hyped CGI that drew me into this movie, it was the all-encompassing, outstanding fantasy artwork which made the world of Pandora come alive.The movie is certainly one of Cameron's best efforts yet (supplanting ""Aliens""), and worthy of repeat viewing in the theaters... now if I can just get those darned 3-D glasses to fit...Addendum:Well, I managed to see this movie three times now, all in 3D, the first time in Dolby 3D, the second in IMAX 3D, and the third time in Real 3D.The IMAX 3D was actually the worst experience for me - because of the ancient linear polarization technology, the 3D effect was lost any time I tilted my head, and I would start to see double images onscreen.  As is often cited, the IMAX technology produced the greatest amount of 3D effect, but things tended to blur in the periphery of the image onscreen.  All of this gave me a headache after three hours of watching this movie.  Part of that may have been from the effort of having to keep my head straight and level for that period of time.The Real 3D was probably the best experience for me - the large glasses fit easily in front of my own glasses, and I had no trouble watching the movie and getting a 3D effect.  It was the most comfortable experience, and the bright screen made the images stand out, making it look as good if not better than the IMAX images.The Dolby 3D was only so-so.  The biggest problem was the small glasses.  It is often mentioned that the glasses are more expensive, perhaps that's why the lenses are so much smaller than the other two technologies.  I had trouble fusing the two images together into a 3D effect at times.  The picture was not quite as bright and sharp as the other two, as this technology is projected onto a regular movie screen.  But at least I could let my head loll around during the movie.So if you get the chance, I would recommend going the Real 3D route.  There are websites that identify which theaters have which of the different technologies, which I will post into the comments section. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(4740, 4754)",1,0.0,False

Belle wants ADVENTURE! She is a marvelous protagonist because so many can relate to her. Yes, Belle is a dreamer but also has a strong, courageous heart to make her dreams come true. She is inspiring because she maintains a balance of her desires for a better life by finding  some joy in every day, no matter what the circumstances are.One day, through an unexpected turn of events, she finds herself locked in a dungeon for the sake and love of her elderly father.  I like how she thinks of him before herself.  That is love.  Only when the Beast, a cruel and hideous monster who once was a prince, (and still is but must find a way to bring out the good in his heart for all to see to break the spell) sends her father away and she doesn't get to say goodbye, does she realize the permanence of her decision.  She has lost ""her father, her freedom and her dreams in one day."" However, dreams have a way of never dying.  As long as they are alive in our hearts there is always Hope.

Also, I love to witness the contrast between the good and bad characters in Disney movies. What a great character study, always! But the transition of the Beast into a true prince at heart, is my favorite to watch; all it took was the right person to help him see the Beauty IN the Beast!I deeply appreciate BEAUTY AND THE BEAST and movies like it which are wonderful reminders of so many valuable lessons:1.) Don't judge a person solely by their outward appearance but by their heart. The inner person of the heart--that is who one really is. The heart can not be hidden, it WILL be revealed, but we must have patience to wait for this.2.) Trust your heart and listen to it--Always.3.) With patience and love, your dreams can come true.4.) Never stop believing in yourself first. Because then no matter how things turn out, you are strong and proud of yourself.5.) Remember that showing kindness and compassion to others is the key to inner peace and true happiness.

It had some new ideas and concepts and some of them didn't really work in the right ways for me. But it did have some brilliant episodes, and got us more interested about the military involvement in vampire slaying.WARNING: THERE MAY BE SPOILERS!Here's my episode-by-episode guide to Season 4#1 THE FRESHMAN - 4/5. A very good opener. Lots of comedic scenes and also shows the estrangement of your first few days of college nicely.#2 LIVING CONDITIONS - 3.5/5. Funny funny episode! I wasn't really all that happy with how it turned out, but it keeps the laughs coming on in, and the editing techniques were great.#3 THE HARSH LIGHT OF DAY - 4/5. This episode gets better with repeated viewings. Lots of good insights on relationships and such. Good music too, and seeing Spike in the sunlight was a treat.#4 FEAR, ITSELF - 4/5. Genuinely creepy episode with great production design. Also some good foreshadowing for the rest of the show.#5 BEER BAD - 2/5. Stupid, pointless episode. But I did kind of enjoy it's silly qualities. Quite funny in parts but overall - just lame and unneeded.#6 WILD AT HEART - 4.5/5. The girl who plays Veruca was atrocious and brought this episode down from a 5. Everything else was excellent!#7 THE INITIATIVE- 4/5. We finally learn about those damn commando guys! A good episode with many funny scenes that got the story-arc going.#8 PANGS - 2.5/5. Gets worse everytime I watch it. The story isn't really needed to the arc of the season, and seems just pointless...#9 SOMETHING BLUE - 4/5. Awesome comedic episode, with great performances by Sarah Michelle Gellar and James Marsters.#10 HUSH - 5/5. Brilliant episode of BTVS - one of the best ever if you ask me! Joss did a brilliant directing and writing job. A unique, very frigtening, funny and just excellent and enjoyable hour of TV!#11 DOOMED - 4/5. Keeps getting better with every viewing. Written by Marti Noxon, Jane Espenson and David Fury - this mixes all of their talents together - drama, comedy and action. Good episode, if not perfect.#12 A NEW MAN - 4/5. Very almost a 4.5, maybe after more viewings. This episode was hilarious and finally Giles got his own little story arc. It didn't really move the story-arc along or anything, but fun all the same.#13 THE I IN TEAM - 4/5. In which we are introduced to the big bad for season 4, and a questionable big bad he is...but the rest of this episode was 4.5 material!#14 GOODBYE IOWA - 3.5/5. Didn't hold my interest as much as the previous episode, but this one definitely gets the big bad's story-arc on the road as we learn more about him. Marc Blucas' acting is also brilliant here.#15 THIS YEAR'S GIRL - 4.5/5. Praise FAITH! She is just an amazing character and I can't explain how great it was to have her back. Everything about this episode was enjoyable - one of the best of the season!#16 WHO ARE YOU - 5/5. Just when I thought it couldn't get better than This Year's Girl, they give us a true Jossian episode with Who Are You. It's a weird idea that could've gone awry, but instead it turns out to be a brilliant one that furthers our knowledge of the characteristics of both Faith and Buffy. Funny, dramatic - brilliant!#17 SUPERSTAR - 4/5. Groovy little episode that gets better every time I watch it. Danny Strong did a great job and the alteration to the credits is just classic in the best sense of the word. Great job!#18 WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE - 0.5/5. Even worse than Superstar. This episode gives a good reason for people to say why they don't like BTVS. This is probably the worst episode of the show ever.#19 NEW MOON RISING - 4.5/5. Thank God for Oz! After those two HORRIBLE episodes beforehand, on comes Oz for his final episode of BTVS (I think, you never know with Joss). The acting here is great, and there is a lot of brilliantly written drama by Marti Noxon.#20 THE YOKO FACTOR - 4.5/5. Good good good! A funny episode that prepares us for the showdown with Adam and the Initiative. Very well done and with great acting by Marc Blucas and David Boreanaz.#21 PRIMEVAL - 4/5. Lots and lots of great action sequences here, and it was awesome to see the gang working as a team once more. The fight with Adam is just classic!#22 RESTLESS - 5/5. One of the most amazing episodes of the show. Though it doesn't quite beat out Hush for best episode of the season. It is very close though. There is a lot of character development here, and the directing job is probably the best the show will ever have. A great way to finish S4!--- DVD REVIEW ---This DVD is great and gives you deeper insight into the ideas for the season. The writers and directors give you a lot of good insights into the episodes they wrote. I love this DVD package. You can buy it in NZ on Region 4 and it is excellent, so when it comes out in the USA, all you American BTVS fans better order a copy from Amazon!

It has some few flaws (enough with the comedy!), but overall feels like a pleasantly familiar return to Middle-Earth -- fire, elves, orc-killing, a magic ring and lots of sweeping New Zealand landscapes.Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) is a nice boring gentlehobbit who has no interest in adventures. Then the wizard Gandalf descends on Bag End with thirteen dwarves. They are setting out for the lost city of Erebor, which the dragon Smaug stole many years ago -- and now Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) wants to reclaim it. Also, Gandalf has volunteered Bilbo as an expert burglar.Despite Bilbo's initial reluctance, he soon finds that the world outside the Shire is a pretty dangerous place -- trolls, goblins, stone giants and an albino orc who wants Thorin's head. And in a deep, dark cave, Bilbo encounters a grotesque creature known as Gollum...At the same time, Radagast the Brown Wizard (Sylvester McCoy) warns Gandalf of something that is poisoning the woods and animals of the Greenwood. Even worse, it's moved into the old fortress of Dol Guldur, and has the power to summon the dead.It took me two viewings of ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" to really generate a valid opinion. The first time I was overwhelmed with fan squeeing over the spectacle, as a moderate-to-obsessed Tolkien nerd. The second time, I was able to more objectively view the movie's pros and cons.Peter Jackson has to be admired for managing to whip the first third of ""The Hobbit"" (plus chunks of ""Unfinished Tales"") into a three-act narrative structure, especially since the story is very small-scale and linear. It's a lighter story than any of the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies (the dwarves raiding Bilbo's pantry), but there's always a dark undercurrent reminding you that there is serious stuff afoot.And Jackson does a typically brilliant job evoking Middle-Earth's danger and majesty, sweeping us across glittering mountain citadels, murky forests and rotted fortresses. There are some absolutely stunning action scenes, such as Thorin stalking down a fallen, burning tree to fight his mortal enemy. He also fleshes out the storyline by exploring the Council investigating the Necromancer (three guesses who he is!), and a prologue showing everything that Thorin's people have suffered and lost. They're depicted as a proud people who have lost everything, and it adds a powerfully tragic undercurrent to the story.However... there are some problems with the movie. The comic relief characters (the trolls, the singing goblin king) simply don't work. And it needs some serious fat trimmed off, with some scenes (the stone giants) that could have been cut completely. It should have been maybe a half-hour shorter, with those scenes reserved for the extended edition.But the actors are pretty much all brilliant. Martin Freeman is the perfect mix of fussiness and gutsiness as Bilbo, and we can see him slowly growing into his friendships with the Dwarves. Richard Armitage is similarly brilliant as a butt-kicking dwarf prince who can be prickly and crabby, but who has also suffered a lot of humiliation and loss.And of course, we have familiar faces like Ian McKellen as the delightfully grumpy Gandalf, Hugo Weaving, Cate Blanchett and Christopher Lee. McCoy is adorably scatterbrained as a wizard who likes animals more than people, and the various dwarves are all given personality and development to make them distinctive. That's a pretty impressive feat with such a large main cast.As for the extended special edition, this only has twelve minutes of new footage -- and since it was a long movie from a duology-turned-trilogy, that isn't surprising. But it will have the vast wealth of extras that we've come to expect from Peter Jackson: ""The Appendices,"" a massive documentary that explores the entire filming of the movie. NINE HOURS OF EXTRAS, including audio commentary from Jackson and Phillipa Boyens.The comedy can be a bit grating, but ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" is still a beautiful, intriguing start to Bilbo Baggins' journey. And the journey will only get more epic and dark. ANSWERNOTFOUND",to reclaim,"(761, 771)",1,0.0,False

I was ready to settle in for some trailers, but there were none. The film started precisely on schedule, and I was already taken aback by the sudden commencement of the film. I wasn't sure how to prepare myself. I knew that I was going to witness disturbing frames of film, but the result was more than I can say. Simply put it, ""The Passion of the Christ"" is an experience that cannot be described in words, but only in the art form that Mel Gibson has created to express a feeling like no other. In this review, I will rave about the film being the best ever. Why? Because it is.""The Passion,"" as most call it in short, is not only Mel Gibson's finest work (he had previously directed ""Bravehart"" and ""The Man Without a Face,"" two fabulous films) but it is the most triumphant motion picture ever to hit the big screen. What we see here is a film with a direct focus that has the ability to create an emotion that is completely indescribable. The focus is on the title, which Gibson uses as the centerpiece of what his film is truly about, and that is the willpower of Jesus Christ, the love and the passion that resided in his body to carry on through the worst possible human torture that anyone has ever endured in history. The only way to really feel that and to express that theme is to show the graphic violence that was depicted by several amazing special effects artists whom worked on this film. On film, it was no longer make-up or special effects; it was real, completely real. Exaggerated? Yes, of course, that's how a theme is drawn out. Although it was the most violent picture I have ever seen in my life, it was made that way to complete this theme of passion. The actual passion is what Jesus had to endure, and had the film been shown any other way that passion could never be conveyed.Every frame of Gibson's work is a concentrated art and has pure perfectionism written all over it. Much of the great visual aspects of the film can be credited to cinematographer Caleb Deschanel, an artist whose work has been nominated several times for Oscars on films such as ""The Natural"" and ""The Patriot."" To further Mel's perfectionism, he relied on production designer Francisco Frigeri and costume designer Maurizio Millenotti to create the very accurate period look to the film. The frighteningly realistic makeup and special-effects were done by Greg Cannom and Renato Agostini, two artists who have now excelled to the most supreme level of movie magic. I also appreciated John Debney's score that was fluent throughout the entire film. As a matter of fact, I can't think of any moments in the film that did not have music playing. It was a really great way to enhance a story that was foreign to our ears and depended on subtitles to convey the literal text of the film. Debney really found his own way of telling a story through music, keeping the audience entrenched in the world Mel Gibson has set us in.And finally, the acting was brutally realistic. Jim Caviezel had the incredibly difficult task of bringing the most beloved figure in history to the screen, Jesus Christ. His performance is worthy of more than an Oscar, but it should be considered one of the top five best performances in the history of film. Rosalinda Celentano had the task of bringing histories most despised figure to screen, Satan. She was not just some creepy figure that made the film scary, but she had a distinct purpose in being the obstacle in Jesus' life. Her constant interference was used to tempt Jesus down a path that would eliminate all passion and glory. I really liked the use of her eyes. It created a distinct look that when she stared at the camera, you felt the intimidation that Jesus was feeling, and the provocation that Jesus felt when she smiled at him. In Gibson's visual style, this would be credited as the motif for the temptation towards Christ. Monica Bellucci played the beautiful Mary Magdalene, a lover of Jesus. She did her job creating emotion alongside another performer whom swept me away, Maia Morgenstern as Mary, Mother of God. What an amazing job she did in creating the passion of a loving mother. Absolutely stunning. Makeup, effects, and costume do a lot to enhance a character, but performance is what makes them real.As a film reviewer, it's not my job to do what I really don't want to do, and that is touch upon the controversy. Before viewing the film I promised myself I wouldn't, but it now seems necessary because I have a few things that need to be cleared up. Anti-Semitic my ass. This film spills the truth. This is what happened in the Bible, this is what the Christian society believes, and this is how it MUST be told. Any other way would disgrace and insult the passages that we know in the Great Book itself. And let me explain how it all works. Did the Jews kill Christ? Yes. Was Jesus Jewish himself? Yes. Oh, and there was another Jewish man who came along to help Christ carry the Cross. In addition, Jesus' Jewish family and friends were on his side. So really, what can we compare this to? Well, if we would all like to use our precious brains that God gave us for just once without trying to stand on some large mountain and get attention by protesting these issues, just think Civil War. Essentially, that's all this is. It is a community of Jewish people all hurting each other. Some are on the good side, Jesus' side; others are on the bad side, Caiphas' side. So why all of a sudden is it Mel Gibson demising a Jewish community whom are all in a conflict? What if he made a picture about the Civil War? Would he be insulting Americans, saying that Americans killed, well, Americans? Honestly, let's think of the circumstances. No matter what group of people you put in there they will all be considered as being demised by Gibson for killing Christ. The fact that it is Jews in the Bible makes it no more than a Civil War, and if we have to cry out and say that that's anti-Semitic, well then we have more issues than I realized, and I only hope there's enough tissues to go around and collect all the tears from these crybabies who are protesting. And that's all I have to say about that.Bottom line, it's not just any great film to see, but far beyond. It is a great experience to go through and to feel. Any person that comes out of this movie saying it wasn't a great experience must be a heartless and cold being with no feeling of remorse for anyone. I hope everyone will see this film and understand what one man went through and ""the passion"" he had to carry on with it further than any human could ever possibly tolerate, regardless of their religious beliefs. You will be moved by this great motion picture epic, I guarantee it.Grade: A++ (first ever)-Rock Hogan ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(6954, 6968)",1,0.0,False

The only previous Emmerich films I'd seen prior to this were Independence Day and Godzilla. Given my limited experience to his work, but with remnants of nostalgia from ID4 (loved it as a kid), I went in expecting this same kind of formula: an element of doom that threatens humanity (malevolent aliens, or in this case the end of the world), people uniting in response to that threat (after the damage had already been done, of course), and in the process exposing humanity's faults for what they are, therefore, eliminating our differences and bringing us closer together as a people. I caught on to this back in the theater, but naivety got the best of me and I think my change in tastes over the years (it's been about a decade since I've seen either of those movies) has caused me to over-analyze Emmerich's latest film. To be blunt, I hated this movie the first time I saw it. The cheese, campiness, ostentatious melodrama, and writing problems bugged me. Now? I don't think it's as bad as before. Despite this movie being a little longer than I'd like, I actually found some very profound themes on a subsequent viewing: mortality (how we take life for granted), selflessness (or vice versa, if you look at all the snobbery throughout some of the characters), and just the very fact of how disconnected we are as a species (which Emmerich tries to build through the many, many characters and their relationships throughout the film, but never really succeeds in fleshing out). The special effects are spiffy and I'm really starting to like Chiwetel Ejiofor as an actor. Maybe I found these themes by accident, but turning my mind to ""popcorn mode"" actually made said themes a little more impacting overall. With that said, these themes are still too unfocused than can make up for all the cheese and ""fun,"" but I can say I actually like the movie at least a little more than I disliked it before. If I had to summarize the movie, I'd say ""go popcorn, but expect a few surprises.""Video - 4.5Sony presents us with an excellent 1080p picture in an original aspect ratio of 2.35:1 framed at 2.39. Colors are especially prominent and diverse throughout the film ranging from very accurate skin tones to lush landscape views and, of course, meteorological destruction. This is complimented by outstanding contrast levels making explosions, smoke, and all that other CG anarchy look flawless. Black levels are also handled near-perfectly, though I think I saw a little color banding through some of the darker-lit scenes. Sharpness, details, textures, and line delineation are also spot-on, adding a great sense of depth and HD pop to the film's presentation. Water during the tsunami scenes in particular stand out to me the most and, despite the weak writing, are amazing to look at from a visual and aesthetic point of view. All the crumbling buildings, fireballs, and earth-splitting are certainly a sight to behold. If at least not for the corresponding reference audio, this is a demo-worthy disc to showcase your HD home theaters for video as well. Which brings me to...Audio - 5.0These days in Hollywood, mayhem usually begets a very strong and active sound field. 2012 is no exception to that as Sony's DTS-HD 5.1 track is every bit as frenetic and chaotic as what you're seeing on the screen. High and low ends are reproduced perfectly. Grinding gravel, shattering glass, the rumbling earth, molten lava, gargantuan tidal waves, vehicle engines, and every other discernible sound effect add an extra level of realism that make the special effects so much more enjoyable. The sub-woofer stays relatively quiet pre-Apocalypse, but when that crust displacement thing starts kicking in, you'll be happy to know that sub you bought is earning its money's worth. Dialogue also stays clear throughout the entire film, never losing consistency in volume level. Separation of said dialogue and all the special effects noises are never a problem either, with directionality giving a very spacious feeling to said destruction all across the sound board. Again, like the video, this would make an especially good reference BD to wow and showcase to your friends.Extras - 3.5As much as I like to give commentaries a listen for whatever kind of extra information on production or writing that they have, I'm going to be honest and say I don't think I have it in me to sit through this movie two more times for both a P-i-P and audio commentary track. After watching the standalone featurettes on disc 2, I find Roland Emmerich to be something of a paradox. He seems like a very detail-attentive director who takes pride in his craft; that craft for this particular movie being a spiffy visual feast of destruction, mayhem, and a sort of child-like imagination in the way those ideas come to fruition. However, unlike a Michael Bay or Jon Turteltaub who both possess that ""big kid director"" kind of approach to movie-making, I feel Emmerich lacks in general enthusiasm as a whole, at least that's the feeling I got from the interviews here. And to sit through two and a half hours of that blandness twice is just not something I'd rather use my free time for. That being said, I give Sony a lot of credit for putting these extras together. A good majority of them focus a lot on production and the ego of Emmerich and his ""master technique"" for making epic disaster films (of which only one really stands out to me at this time), while the rest of the features are tied into the whole Mayan Calender and impending Apocalypse craze. I found these parts to be interesting at some points, but then blatantly insulting at others. For a movie about the end of the world that supposedly uses scientific ""truth"" and reasoning for a believable premise, the ""experts"" interviewed here are more than adamant to the point of either saying ""it could happen,"" or as that one scientist said ""it will happen [and that I've been right all along because this movie is so well-crafted by Emmerich, how can it not be the truth?]."" On top of that, he goes on to use the excuse that the reason most regular people won't believe his theory is because of a subconscious defense to the ""fear"" that our lives will, indeed, end when he says it will according to the Mayan Calender. Take from these segments what you will, but after such a brazen display in ideological put-downs that nearly defeated the purpose of the movie for me, I have to say it's a strange array of extras that gets an A in effort, but a C in continuity and bias.Overall - 4.0I didn't like the film so much the first time around, but was surprised upon a repeat viewing. For me, I like movies that manage to have a little bit of everything: good production values, an engaging story and/or characters that, when aptly put together, make for some semblance of entertainment or thought-provocation, and a good cast of actors/actresses. 2012, while on the extremely high end of production values, also has a surprising amount profundity with more or less cookie-cutter archetypal characters, though with a good performance by one Chiwetal Ejiofor. Consequently, the presence of many an absurdity represented by some of the supporting/unnecessary characters, cheesy screenplay, silly script, and unfocused attention to some of the finer details in the writing ruin what could've made this a much more fulfilling and epic Apocalypse film. I wish I could say this is more than another popcorn flick and a definite must-own title outside of its reference A/V presentation, but I consider this a rental at best. However, if you're happy enough with the popcorn mentality and aren't bothered by some of the movie's faults, then this is definitely worth adding to your collection.

And that, my friends, is the bottom dollar.I, for one, liked the film. I saw it when it came out, and I own the DVD. I still like the film. Despite all the 'what should've and could've beens'. And I will support future endeavors. Because that is what a fan does. (And hope new producers and directors of the near future take this franchise, which still has tons of material to be filmed, and show it for all its bloody and exciting glory.)Stay tuned.

Lets talk about the movie itself. (MAYBE SOME SPOILERS). I am a die hard fan of all the movies and shows including TOS. The movie was great entertainment, great special affects, all actors did a well as expected job.Story direction: I am a little disappointed in the direction this story went or is going. I know there are dozens of storys to be used even from TOS that were never made into shows. Why remake a whole movie? Especially one that was probably the most successful? Its one thing to tweak threads from different storys but to rearrange and retell an entire movie and story line....I really expected more from Abrams. The movie was extremely fast paced and barely any time for any substantial dialogue. It teetered on the edge of lacking substance. The growing bond with Kirk/Spock/McCoy. I'm not saying I didn't like the movie but it seems they tried to pack so much into the movie it was busting at the seams with any and every tid bit of information of TOS history, including using old lines (some re-worded) from the original series or previous movies from the old cast. I think its ok to resemble some lines etc but don't just throw them in there just to have them in there. I do like the way Marcus and Nurse Chapel were brought into the story, very clever.Characters: Dr. McCoy--What was bothersome were the amount of cliched analogy's they had Dr. McCoy spouting off. At one point in the movie Spock said, ""enough already with the analogy's"". That was amusing but it was no longer amusing when they had McCoy continue doing these analogy's, in fact I would say JJ Abrams was on the edge of ""SPOOFING"" the good doctor. McCoy had very little insightful or useful dialogue throughout the whole movie. That was disappointing. We all love McCoy's attitude and sarcasm with Kirk and Spock, but they really wore it to death with every one liner cliche they could pack in there. McCoy deserves better than that.Spock: Although Zachary Quinto does a great job with Spock, the Spock character it seems has been softened for lack of better words. And what about this fling he has with Uhura? Pryor story? Originally written? I don't know, but it makes Spock a bit of a pansy, instead of a level headed Vulcan always in control. And what about ""PON FAR""? I guess that's out the window now? I'm just not buyng this fling with Uhura. This movie had moments where he was indecisive and unsure of himself. That's not the Spock we know from past, even the young Spock from past. True he was young and still learning to cope with his human side. But if he wasn't in control as a Vulcan should be then he probably wasn't ready for life in general much less being a Star Fleet officer.Uhura: Great job by the actress but they have her character very lax & emotional, its not complimentary of a StarFleet officer nor to the original Uhura character. Scotty, Chekov and Sulu all do well and their characters flow well in these new movies.Kirk: Chris Pine does as well as expected on Kirk. Maybe just a little bit too lax in his command. I realize this is young Kirk and he is learning who he is. But even a young Kirk would actually command more respect than an older Kirk who's been around the block.Kahn: This guy did OK job, but he lacked the strong screen presence even the older Kahn gave us. Obviously no one can match Ricardo Montalban but if you cant find someone with equally or more  powerful substance on the screen, then dont do it at all. Even Kahn's character deserved some one better.Bottom Line: The movie is entertaining and very watchable. Although it is a remake of an older one, they did change it up enough to keep you guessing. But it wasn't enough to cover my disappointment of trying to do the remake in the first place. I am concerned on where Abrams is going with these characters. My other concern is ending up with a bunch of remakes of movies from the 80""s. These movies will stand the test of time, leave them alone. So far every single Star Trek Big Picture has been with an original story, even TNG movies never remade from an old old movie.The first Star Trek movie Abrams did offered us a great perspective of the whole crew and how they came to be, this movie although is entertaining, was not nearly as fresh and exciting as the previous one.

I am very happy that I did, it is worth the extra cost!The basic story of GHOST RIDER is that a young man gets cheated in a deal with the devil and must become the devil's bounty hunter, (while trying to figure out how to beat the devil at his own game).There are 13 extra minutes of movie time on this DVD, and at least half of it takes place during the origin scenes involving the teenaged Johnny Blaze (not the adult Johnny Blaze played by Nicolas Cage). This extra footage is just as enjoyable as any other portion of the teen scenes, and it really helps a lot to develop the characters more!I especially like the new scene when the young Johnny Blaze asks to ride his dad's favored motorcycle named ""Grace."" ""Do you think you're man enough to ride Grace?"" ""Hell, yes!"" ""Well, I don't think so..."" Later his dad gives him the keys to Grace, to runaway with Roxanne, saying if he rides Grace he'll have a head start on his new life.Most of the other added minutes are short additions to already existing scenes, usually an extra line of dialog during conversations.I can only think of one scene where the new footage actually REPLACES original footage, (but still makes it better). In the saloon scene when Blackheart rounds up his spirit henchmen, originally one henchman asks, ""What about Mephistopheles?,"" and the scene ends with Blackheart replying that nobody may ever mention that name to him. In this improved EXTENDED CUT, instead of the question being asked, Mephistopheles himself shouts out for Blackheart to come outside the saloon to talk with him, and then there is the added scene of their discussion, which also helps to develop both characters better.I haven't really noticed any extra footage of the special effects Ghost Rider character himself, but the improved character development in all the other (mostly non-special effects) scenes is well worth the purchase of this EXTENDED CUT DVD, if you already know that you like this film, and even if you are seeing it for the first time with the EXTENDED CUT, you will have a better chance of liking it more.The Director's Commentary is excellent and informative. There is also a separate Producer's Commentary track, which is pretty good, too. One annoying story by the Producer is how he met actor Sam Elliott as a kid on a movie set, and is now ""paying him back"" for being so nice to him by giving Sam Elliott a role in GHOST RIDER. I think Sam Elliott could have gotten this gig all on his own, since he already had a major role in a Marvel Comics film, as General Ross in THE HULK movie, a few years back!Hulk (Widescreen 2-Disc Special Edition)The EXTENDED CUT doesn't add much in the way of ""Making Of"" material. It adds about 20 minutes of poorly edited video touring the computer facilities where the computer effects are worked on, though the EXTENDED CUT DVD has a very enjoyable series of interview footage with comic book creators of the Ghost Rider character, that is very interesting and informative if you are into comic book history, like I am. This extra comic book interview material is separated by which decades are being discussed (mostly), 1970s, 80s, 90s, and 2000s; each decade getting about 10+ minutes, totaling about 40 minutes. Writer/editor Roy Thomas starts the 1970s section with a brief history of the character dating back to the early 1950s, inspired by the original song, and as a cowboy ghost rider. This section could have been made better by having a PLAY ALL function, so you do have to hit play after viewing each decade, but if you like comics history then it will be worth it.I really enjoy this GHOST RIDER EXTENDED CUT DVD, and I think it is the best movie/DVD of 2007, in my opinion. GHOST RIDER is not as good as SPIDER-MAN 2, the best comic book movie ever, but I like this GHOST RIDER film better than 2007's overstuffed, underdeveloped SPIDER-MAN 3 film!Spider-Man 2 (Widescreen Special Edition)Perhaps this GHOST RIDER movie's biggest weakness is that sometimes the main character, as a special effect, looks a little stiff, but this improves as the film progresses. But this movie version is better than the comics version, especially since the movie's Johnny Blaze is tempted and tricked by the devil but does not seek the devil out, as opposed to the original Marvel Comics story where Johnny Blaze turns to his Satanic past history of studying devil worship and summons the devil to cut a deal, as can be seen in the Marvel Comics collection called THE ESSENTIAL GHOST RIDER, VOLUME 1.Essential Ghost Rider, Vol. 1 (Marvel Essentials)The best things about this movie are that the story is fun, funny, and interesting, and also that most of the characters and actors are very likable. I also really like the somewhat Biblical imagery and references, some more overtly obvious than others, (like when one character speaks the Bible verse, ""I am Legion, for we are many!,"" or when Johnny's dad tells him to ride Grace, being a writer's metaphor for the Grace of God, which the Bible says is mandatory for Christians to live by); and with my own past, I feel like I can relate to the Johnny Blaze character trying to beat the devil who dogs his every step, and trying to beat your own foolish deals with the devil in your past, to try to fight against the devil and look out for other people to not get hurt by the devil.I also like the way that this film takes it for granted that Hell and the devil exist, as opposed to most of our secular western culture that wants to pretend that there is no devil, no Hell, and no eternal punishment. Sure, this film gets it wrong that one must CHOOSE to sell your soul to the devil, (like most of our western culture also believes), despite that the Bible teaches that all are condemned to Hell unless they CHOOSE to follow Jesus! But GHOST RIDER's depictions of the devil, Hell, and evil spirits are a lot closer to Bible teachings than many popular heretics of today who claim to be Christians while denying the existence of Hell, the devil, and that the Bible teaches of the existence of these things!

Because of its religious nature, it is nearly impossible to judge it simply as some flick to go see.  However, I'll first judge the film on whether or not you should go out and see it in the theatres, then on its movie merits, and I'll conclude with some thoughts on what this movie means theologically.If you are looking for a film to escape into, or looking for great entertainment value, or basically most of the reasons we go to see movies, The Passion is not the movie for you.  Firstly, this film is horrifyingly graphic and violent.  It is an accurate reflection of life as it was.  Outside of the graphic nature of the film, the 100 minutes of cellulite that represents that sum total of Christ's sacrifice is agonizing.  Though Mel Gibson breaks some of this up with flashbacks from Christ's earlier years, it's just so intense that if you don't understand the theology of the film, you won't enjoy this at all.  Simply said, this film was made for Christians that are committed to their faith, not for agnostics, atheists, or the average filmgoer.I don't mean to imply that this film is somehow ""too good"" for atheists, agnostics and non-believers.  I simply mean to state that this film is not attempting to be entertaining, or thought provoking, or anything else.  Christ's teachings are skimmed over, and not really mentioned, the consequences of the crucifixion are not expelled upon.  Simply, this is a portrayal of The Passion of Jesus as He went through what was destined.The merits of the film as a film are not lacking by any stretch of the imagination.  Though the film is based on the Gospels, as a story the life of Christ is far from boring.  Betrayal, skepticism, murder, conspiracy, love, belief, purpose.  All are part of the story of His last day.Similarly, there aren't any plot problems, subplot problems, theme issues, or major holes to speak of.  The accounts of His crucifixion take less than three pages of text per gospel.  As such, simplicity prevents questions of direction and purpose.Mel Gibson directed this film quite well.  The film flows together quite well.  Mel's vision of the last day of Christ is well done.  I am at a lack for words when it comes to describing the thanks I have for Mel Gibson for doing this film in the way he has.  His choice to be the man who nails Christ to the cross is important, and all but avoids silly questions about the anti-Semitic nature of this film.  Gibson's vision of the humiliation and struggle on His last day are awakening.  As a convert from atheism to Christianity, this movie has helped me in ways innumerous.Mel Gibson aside, the acting in The Passion is extraordinary in itself.  The highlights are Hristo Shopov's portrayal of Pontius Pilate.  Also, kudos are needed for Rosalinda Celentano's thankless portrayal of Satan.  Ms. Celetano's performance was visually spectacular .  Finally, James Caviezel gives an unbelievable performance of endurance as Jesus.  These actors deserve a lot of credit for making this film what it is.What is this movie?  An attempt to show the earthly pain that God as Man went through for us, all of humanity.  He carried our sins, the sins of all Mankind in an ongoing sacrifice.  That burden is incomprehensible to us as humans, but we get a taste of it here in this film.  Thank you Mel Gibson. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3368, 3382)",2,0.0,False

For anyone under 30, you know that the 1980's is the new 1940's. This is the golden age of cinema for the MTV Generation. And that just makes ""Back to the Future"" so much more special because even with tons of other great feature films, it still stands out.The movie has so many great lines and catchphrases, such as, ""Hello, hello, anyone home? Think McFly, think."" I can not so fondly remember how my teenage uncles used to imitate Biff and knock on mine and my brother's head just like Biff did to George. Another great line, ""history's gonna change.""I also love the entire cast. From beginning to end the cast is totally perfect. My favorite of course is Michael J. Fox as Marty. He was the perfect actor to play this role because he was so cute and cool and brave. (BTW, can you believe they were originally gonna use Eric Stoltz! Can you say: MISCAST!!) I also love Crispin Glover (Geroge McFly, although in the 2nd one he was played by Jeffrey Weissman) who was so completely funny. Christopher Lloyd as the Doc was perfect. He totally reminded me of his character from ""Taxi."" Rounding out the cast is Lea Thompson (Lorraine, Marty's mom) and Thomas F. Wilson (as the unforgettable Biff Tannen.) I also like both of the Jennifers (Claudia Wells was in the first one) (Elisabeth Shue was in the second 2 movies.) My favorite Jennifer was Claudia Wells but she refused to do the sequels because of ""personal issues."" Maybe she wanted more money like Crispin Glover? Oh and I also really liked Wendie Jo Sperber (may she rest in peace) (who played Marty's sister, Linda.) I especially liked how Linda took the curlers out of her hair at the dining room table, that's so 80's!!Instead of going on about the storylines and plots for each of these movies (that the entire world has seen) I thought it would be more fun to describe some of the old and otherwise archaic technologies, culture and styles that were displayed in the ""future"" Hill Valley of 2015. It made the movie appear somewhat dated, but that's why it's an entertaining 80's film.Payphones - There was a clear shot of one during the daytime scene when Marty left the cafe. I can't remember the last time I've even seen a payphone, let alone used one (maybe 10 years?) Last year the country's biggest phone company announced that because of the advent of cell phones they were getting out of the payphone business.Picture Frames - There was a ton of these all over the McFly's end table. Although not obsolete yet, most agree that within the next few years we will begin to see less and less of these because digital frames will be much easier to access.Bulletin Flyers - These were displayed outside of the cafe, near the dumpster. This is something else that I can't remember seeing for years and years. Probably because of electronic networks like Craigslist.Sales Staff that ""wait on"" customers - The saleslady in the ""antique"" store was totally waiting on Marty and trying to get him to buy something. The small ""mom & pop"" stores of yesterday are nearly totally gone. And those huge department stores that replaced them do not have the time, energy or patience to wait on anyone.Faxes - Marty's home had fax machines everywhere (even inside the closet!) First of all, did you see how antiquated the print on the faxes looked? So 1985. For the home consumers, faxes and telexes are about as useful as Morse code. And for businesses they will be a thing of the past within the next 5 to 10 years for obvious reasons.Mailboxes - There was one in the ""center"" of Hill Valley (next to the USA Today newspaper dispenser.) With electronic billing, text messages and cell phones we are mailing less and less. ""Snail mail"" will never completely evaporate, but these old-fashioned-looking mailboxes are becoming a thing of the past.Green Screen Door - This was the door that old Biff scampered out of before he got in the taxi to follow Doc and Marty. You'd think that in 2015 they would have nicer looking doors? This one looks like something straight out of the 1950's.Oversized Earnings - The saleslady in the ""antique"" store was wearing this godawful pair of yellow earrings that are roughly the size of a Jr. cheeseburger from Wendy's. And the old Jennifer also had on a pair of these large things on her ears. Ear-jewelry like this has not been in style since ""The Golden Girls"" were on TV.Wallpaper - The McFly's home was covered in this. This is something else that is totally out of style. Last year when I was helping a friend redo her kitchen we went to a popular home improvement store to get some border and were told that they stopped manufacturing this years ago....The entire ""Back to the Future Trilogy"" is beyond perfect. And, the music is so fast and funny. Huey Lewis & The News. My goodness, talk about bringing back the dead. The Trilogy is not too much and not too little. You know how some movies can drag on and on and on (like this review?) that's not the case here. Michael J. Fox was a brand-new man in each of these movies. Of course the first one is the very best. But I enjoyed ""Back to the Future Part II"" immensely (and Part III, as wel.) As any child of the 80's can attest to, this movie was such a hugely anticipated event. ""Back to the Future Part II"" was almost like a religious experience because no one could live without it. Everyone has to see all 3 of these movies. Even if the ""Back to the Future Trilogy"" had Skippy, Elyse, Mallory & Tina Yothers it still couldn't be more 80's! Sha la la la... ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(5570, 5584)",3,0.0,False

The answers are simple:Sofia Coppola has made an incredible love movie for the new millenium that doesn't pander to very contemorary cliche, involve sex (well, almost) or deal with accepted romance standards.  And what she made was something more fluid and romantic then anything I've seen for years in movies.

Most amazing is the small detail of the 'Dr. Who Sci Fi' hum of machinery within cooridors and buildings that masks a constant noise of choatic human activity just beyond the walls of any room.  And more evidently, the story of miscommunication and alienation within a world in your face, yet emotionally beyond your reach is relayed brilliantly.This film will grow with the Japophile, and be a sweet romance to anyone unfamiliar with the idea of being segregated within a society they can't relate to.

The film is notable for several reasons. Christopher Lee makes his first appearance as Dracula, his most famous role. Unlike Bela Lugosi's sense of tragic mystery, Lee stresses the vampire's delight in his unholy lusts. Lust is the key word. The late-Victorian era novel dealt only indirectly with sex. This movie has a definite erotic tone that is a Hammer tradition. For 1958, this was sexy stuff. Prim and proper women wantonly seek the vampire's kiss. The penetration is of the fangs in the neck variety, but we get the idea. Peter Cushing is Van Helsing, the vampire slayer. The brilliant casting of Cushing and Lee as adversaries became familiar fare in many subsequent horror flicks. The final battle between Dracula and Van Helsing in Dracula's castle is one of the great moments in vampire cinema. Lee's towering, menacing figure in the flowing black cape dominates the film. Lee's dialogue is minimal, but he projects more danger with icy stares than most actors accomplish with reams of discourse. When bloodlust rages, he is feral and overpowering. The characters are based on Bram Stoker's work, but the story unfolds in a way uniquely its own. One minor note: the obvious British accents of the supporting cast provokes unintended chuckles as they portray central European innkeepers and domestics. Little Tania is a special hoot. This is a great example of the way they used to make horror movies before the onslaught of insane killers stalking teenagers in a theater near you. Collectors building a library of Classic Horror 101 certainly need this one. ;-) ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1632, 1646)",1,0.0,False

In fact, I think if the two volumes had cross-pollinated a little more, you wouldn't have had just a good movie and a half, but two great films.But for now, Kill Bill Vol. 1.  It's the &quot;action&quot; half of the twins, and it dazzles right from the start with an audacious, extended extreme close-up on Uma Thurman's face.  The scene after, the duel between The Bride and Vernita Green, is classic Quentin Tarantino, heralding a return to his outrageous, dramatically intense roots.  Probably the strongest scene he's directed since the Mr. Pink-Mr. White altercation in Reservoir Dogs.  Unfortunately, after The Bride wakes up from her coma, the dramatic content flies down the meter, with a lot of posing and one-liners but very little in terms of character or emotional satisfaction.  Which means it's up to the endless action set pieces to grab our attention.  And they do.  However, I find them a little too bloody, even though I've spent the last 16 months digging through Shaw Brothers films (through the excellent Celestial Pictures VCD and DVD releases).  The endless bloodletting in Kill Bill Vol. 1 is shocking in the beginning, but after about five minutes in the extended climactic massacre, it's numbing.And for the record, Kill Bill Vol. 1 is not a Shaw Brothers kind of film, despite the Shaw logo which opens the film.  You would have to wait until the &quot;training&quot; sequences in Vol. 2 to get Shaw Brothers-style cinema (which Tarantino appropriates very well there).  Vol. 1 is much more a paean to the Japanese style of filmmaking:  Extremely saturated colours courtesy of cinematographer Robert Richardson (even Shaw films didn't go this far in terms of garish colours -- we're in '80s Kurosawa territory here), emphasis on extreme wide shots, the very long builds, the brilliant music by The RZA.  And the martial-arts sequences are modern in their multi-angularity and speed cuts; Shaw Brothers action as epitomized by Chang Cheh's style focuses much more on choreography and mise en scene than multi-angularity, letting long medium shots capture the movement of the actors and fighters, relying very little on cuts.All in all, the most lacking element in Kill Bill Vol. 1 is still story and character.  Uma Thurman has some great moments (such as when The Bride first wakes up in the hospital), but after those blazing first 30 minutes, she will mostly become a statuesque hellfire angel who doesn't have a great deal of emotional advancement.  You will get that in spades in Vol. 2, which is hands down a superior story and film -- without the visual eye candy and endless action of Vol. 1, but with such powerful dramatic moments that it barely matters.  Again, I think if Tarantino had been able to meld the action and the drama a little more, rather than separate them into two movies that contain most of one and almost none of the other, he would have made both films greater than what they are.  As it stands, Vol. 2 will be what truly burns these characters and Tarantino's vision into your mind, while Vol. 1 is the adrenalized thrill ride with energy to spare, but without much in terms of thematic depth.

We live in such a troubled time where the most important thing should be for all people to be accepted totally - whatever their sex, race, age, color or sexual identity.  The hate reviews here really do trouble me for the hate really isn't for the people they are attacking but comes from within the people themselves.  The only people capable of such hate are those who have it within themselves and must look at themselves first.That aside, let me review the brilliant masterpiece that is BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN.  The film is beautiful in every way.  Spellbinding cinematography, amazing script and actors giving some of the best performances of their career.  This film for all its grandeur is a simplistic, realistic love story for the ages.  Some have called it the gay GONE WITH THE WIND.  The most important thing here is that none of the characters are stereotypes.  Yes, the relationship is between two men but that is not the purpose of the film.  It is not a gay message film.  It is a love message film.  When two people connect in that special way that enables them to share their hearts, souls and celebrate it through the beauty of sexual expression it is a gift for any two people be they man/woman, woman/woman or man/man.  When this unique transcending true love is actualized it can happen between any two people.  A man who lives his life straight may find it with one other special man.  He may not be what we define as gay.  His love is for this man.  With this man gone he may desire no other man.  True love is such a gift and should never be denied.  And shame on anyone who tries to deny others from having it.Here we see that kind of love happen for Ennis and Jack.  The intimacy they feel takes the two of them by surprise and they develop a bond that only comes with true love.  The film shows us how they both deal with this love and how it affects their lives and other interpersonal relationships.  Heath Ledger and Jeke Gyllenhaal are spellbinding here and attack their characterizations with true honesty no holds barred.  The other stand out is Michelle Williams in a ground breaking, career making performance as Ennis's wife.  Her journey could have been so stereotypical but in her hands it is a splendind self realized exploration a woman must endure.The story here is romantic, tragic, happy sad and a timeless tale.  The blu ray version is astounding.  This film was made for it and it will seem like viewing the picture for the first time.  The 1080p high def picture is astounding.  The scenery pops with immense clarity, colors are crisp and close ups have perfect flesh tones.  The dialogue comes out strong and the beautiful music soars through the speakers as this beautiful tale is told.This film should definitely have won best picture but the fact that it got so many nominations is enough I guess.  I pray for the day when we as a society celebrate love pure and simple with no other issues mattering.  Highly recommend this amazing film. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3024, 3038)",2,0.0,False

First of all my interest started to drift from this film, when I spotted acting flaws in both hayden and Ewans performance.  However after talking to many people who have watched the film and reading other reviews, it seems i'm not the only one who spotted bad acting.  The worst performance came from Hayden Christensen, especially on the emotional scenes.  I have read that George Lucas was initially going to take on Leornardo DiCaprio to play Anakin, which in my opinion was a much better choice.  Not only DiCaprio looks like the boy in Phantom Menace, but he is a better actor and would've held a stronger screen presence.  Surprisingly, Ewan's performance wasn't as strong in this one, as it was in the Phantom Menace, I think maybe he was too relaxed in his role.  I think Lucas focused so much on special effects and the digital yoda, that he forgot what makes a good film in the first place, and thats 'performance.'  After watching the documentaries on the dvd, Christopher Lee said that despite the fact that the effects have taken over a fair bit, there is still a strong need for performance, however since Lee's character was played by a body-double in most of his scenes, I find this ironic.Now the positive aspects of the film.  Well done ILM, for bringing digital Yoda to life.  Superb scene, with Yoda fighting with his light saber, but I dont think this was enough to save the film from its demise.  The soundtrack was the strong hold of the picture, I think John Williams scored superbly, bringing the feel of love into the story.The film wasn't all bad, but you would expect better from a Star Wars film, and the bad acting did let the film down dramatically.

I imagine many readers of the classic Arthur Conan Doyle stories had this same reaction, and I realize why. The trailers for the film actually do it a disservice by showing all the action and special effects and none of the intellectualism that the writers actually keep somewhat sacred from the source material. Its true that these loyalties are somewhat hidden beneath effects, but nevertheless, I not only liked Ritchie's reimagining of the sly sleuth, but I applauded several times throughout the film.Like all of Ritchie's films, the plot is somewhat convoluted. Three people are credited under screenplay, which may be an indicator that this was a complex screen story to begin with. True enough, the small details of the film are vital, and the manic way that Ritchie directs serves this purpose strangely well, stripping away many pacing issues and much of the banality that could have come attached to this sort of project. As the movie begins, Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) and Watson (Jude Law) manage to bring to justice some kind of black magic-cult leader named Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) who is hanged for several mysterious murders around London. He then rises from the grave, and must be stopped before he fulfills his threatening plot against all of England. Meanwhile, Watson is in the process of retiring from his partnership with Holmes due to his erratic behavior and repellent lifestyle.Of course, they must join together one last time to take down the nemesis Blackwood. In the process of doing so, they encounter Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams), a criminal and former lover of Holmes' who ran off leaving him heartbroken. Robert Downey Jr. has excellent chemistry with both McAdams and Law, which is crucial in a film with such a confusing plot as this. The characters are very fun to listen to, particularly the bickering between Holmes and Watson, driven by brilliant actors. Downey Jr. is superb as usual here, bringing charm and whimsy while also maintaining Holmes' boozy, fist aiming, somewhat depressed nature.The production design is excellent here, particularly in the final showdown atop an unfinished tower bridge. To see the period placed in this context is truly fascinating. There are some wonderful Ritchie trademarks as well, and he uses all of his best hallmark shots, such as a slow-motion sequence involving a vast amount of explosives. All of these special effects, rather than burying the film's more grounded aspects, simply compliment the subtle and terrific performances, and the complicated but enduring story.Hans Zimmer's excellent score is also noteworthy, as its banjos, accordions, harpsichords, tack pianos, drums and string sections stomp forth and chug along forcefully and confidently, denoting Holmes' certainly that this is just another case that is, as Basil Rathbone's portrayal once said, ""Elementary, my dear Watson.""

How true that statement is? It all comes down to your sense of humor I guess. Humor is subjective much like everything else but it does have some universal rules that gives it an objective view. So, if the masses thought that a specific film is funny then it should be. Unfortunately that wasn't the case with Ted or at least from my experience.I won't come here and say somethings like: ""this is the most terrible movie that I've ever seen, Just stay away from it.Oh My, the amount of racist, sexual inappropriate jokes is a turn off and everyone be as far as possible from this indecent and corrupted piece of disgusting photography that has a general outline also called as a movie for moral's sake and good old PG films""Actually the sense of humor unlike many others who didn't enjoy this film is probably not the main reason I didn't like it. I'm used to Family Guy I won't say it's the best show on earth because I personally don't find it hilarious but it's watchable and sometimes though rarely funny. The so called Shocking content wasn't also why I give this film a 2 star I'm not a Prude by any means! Actually the more shocking and inappropriate the better. The Cast was good, the premise has been done before but not in a R rated form so that was kinda new. So What went wrong? I don't know I just think this movie is somehow lacking.I personally was hoping to laugh like there's no tomorrow, however that didn't happen some jokes were funny but the majority of the film wasn't which is somehow skipping the point of this story, I mean it is supposed to entertain and humor you through out right? versus a couple of scenes.It was really hard to feel sorry or sympathetic for Ted *the main character* because he wasn't likable at all. Not mainly because he smoke pot and bullsh*t a lot. But because he just wasn't. He was obnoxious, unbearable and totally without an agenda for the future, he was just like a Paris Hilton bear version those people who do nothing all day, and just party all long and then do it all again, while the rest of the population is working their heads off for financial security. How can anyone like these people seriously?I think the character of Ted is quite two dimensional which is bad, because it had the opportunity to be much more. It could've at least had some redeeming qualities like a bear wisdom for example? So, yeah wasted potential.All in all, this movie tries so hard to be different from your average Rom/Com, mainly because it's R rated and it's about a teddy bear who can not only speak but smoke pot, drink bud lights, party, mess around, have random sex and date hookers. But that's about as different as it's going to get from a Rom/Com. A more intelligent sense of humor and witty dialogue would've really helped this movie stand out but the writing was totally ignored I guess. Because who wouldn't wanna watch an R rated movie of a Bear named Ted? It's like the producers said Oh, the premise alone should attracted audiences and makes it a good movie so why bother with anything else.I can only imagine Ted appealing to a more younger audience, an audience of 13-16 year olds and occasionally men. Because the sense of humor is don't ask why funny for that age category for some reason. Mainly because those kids believe that the likes of Family Guy will make them look cool, Hey I'm watching a potty filled humor tv show that my parents will kill me if they ever find out. I know everything about sex references and racist jokes now and they think am all innocent and sweet how special am I! I can visualize two 14 years old stealing this movie after it came out on dvd and their parents were watching it with a couple of adult friends while on weekend get together spent drinking beer, and just laughing their heads off at every single boring joke this film has to offer.I've outgrown this sense of humor, really it's no longer funny or shocking.

Not a fanatic. But I did love the originals. I think people remember the original trilogy when they were like 12 and so nobody minded all the unrealistic and childish elements then. As kids, Star  Wars was flawless. The scene in &quot;Empire Strikes Back&quot; still irks  me, where they land inside a giant worm's stomach and of course, there is  air pressure and gravity just like on Earth, even though they are in an  asteroid! Nobody even checks to see if its safe to leave the ship.Episode I was superior in many aspects. NOTHING in the old trilogy is  anywhere near as visually stunning as Naboo and Corusant. Those two things  alone make the movie worth watching. The costumes, and the ships are much  sleeker and more believable than the originals ever were. The light saber  duel was ten times more exciting than anything in the first trio. Even John  Williams' score &quot;Duel of the Fates&quot; is unforgettable and far  beyond any of the original music. As for Jar Jar being annoying, yes, he  was annoying, but that didn't bother me a bit! Because he was PLAYING an  annoying character! He was SUPPOSED to be annoying. He annoyed Obi and  Qui-Gon too. That was part of the necessary comic relief to play as a foil  to the stoic Jedi.As for the Jedi acting stiff, well of course they  were, THEY ARE JEDI! Jedi aren't supposed to be emotional. And still I  really felt for Qui-Gon in the end. Anakin I must admit didn't act all too  well. But what really irks me about TPM are the small things. The robot  going; &quot;Roger Roger&quot; made me want to scream; &quot;IS THIS  SATURDAY MORNING CARTOONS?&quot; And what I hated most, the way most people  felt about Jar Jar, is how I felt about that dumb two headed announcer. I  mean he looked so cartoonish, and he sounded just like Howard Cosell! That  was simply too much of a stretch of the imagination. But the plot, in my  mind, was superb. Those who didn't like it didn't understand it maybe. It  was rather deeper than the others. Basically it involved a corrupt Galactic  Senator trying to get himself elected to a higher position by creating a  Trade Dispute with a foreign planet, putting himself as the person who  would &quot;save the day&quot; when in actuality he is the cause of the  dispute. You could even argue that after Episode 1 the bad guys actually  won.As for buying this VHS, I really think we should all unite as Star  Wars fans and send a clear message to Lucas that; &quot;We are not going to  fall for these stupid business tactics!

The Reaping is approaching fast and Primrose is frightened she will be chosen even though it will be the first time her name is in the drawing. When Prim's name is called, Katniss volunteers as tribute to take part in the Hunger Games, where 2 young people (boy and girl, aged 12 to 18) from each of the 12 districts fight to the death for prestige and goods for their district. Only one victor survives. Katniss is plunged into a completely different world where being memorable and likeable will mean her survival. She will do what it takes to survive, but will it be enough?I read The Hunger Games a couple of years ago and it was never my favorite in the series. I felt it was a Battle Royale ripoff and the later books explored the dystopic world better and went beyond the obvious comparisons between the two works. This film made me forget all that. I was completely blown away and I really want to watch it about 20 more times. I haven't felt like this about a movie in a really long time. The ensemble cast was amazing, giving believable portrayal of characters I feel I know very well after reading 3 books about them. Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen acted wonderfully. She always had an air of sadness yet responsibility. She made the tough heroine believable and relatable because her emotions were close beneath the surface despite her hard exterior. Elizabeth Banks as Effie Trinket provided much needed humor that alleviated the emotion and drama of the story. The other most notable actors were Woody Harrelson as Haymitch (more comic relief and makes Katniss realize the gravity of the reality TV aspect) and Isabel Fuhrman as Clove (sociopath and career tribute that left me with a chill every time she was onscreen).This film did 3 things extremely well that made it one of the best book to film transitions I've ever seen: capturing the emotions, humanizing the otherwise unlikeable characters, and working out timing. Two scenes in particular were very emotional for me.  The scene where Katniss volunteers as tribute for her sister was absolutely heartwrenching even though I had seen at least some of the scene hundreds of times in the past month from the commercials. The other scene that made me bawl like a baby was when Rue died. It was so sudden it took me a few moments for her death to process. I had cried at the scene in the book, but it's different seeing it on the screen. It was captured perfectly and there wasn't a dry eye in my theater. The other tributes were well humanized despite being portrayed as villains, especially the career tributes. Marvel at the end made a speech about how even he won he would be doomed because the Games are all he was good for. It showed that the other tributes aren't the real villains; President Snow and all those that perpetuate these sadistic Games are. I was surprised at how well the film flowed from scene to scene. About half of the film was dedicated to portraying the world, the assessing of the tributes, and the reality television aspect of the Games. The Games took up the latter half. I was never bored and I never thought any of the scenes ran too long. Although every single scene of the book wasn't included in the film, the essential scenes were preserved and given a satisfying amount of time.The most important triumph of this film was that I was never distracted by analyzing each and every difference from the novel. I was completely immersed in the cruel and depressing world of The Hunger Games and wondered at the characters' capacity for hope in the face of a bleak totalitarian regime. The only drawback at all was the shaky cam got a little extreme at points. Usually I'm against it on principle, but it let the film keep a gritty edge without pushing the boundaries into rated R territory by showing graphic scenes of children killing each other. I did not consider this book the best in the series and this movie was simply amazing. I can't wait to see what great films will be made of Catching Fire and Mockingjay.

That would've been a big mistake though. Ebert gave it one star and called the 5 main characters idiots for what they attempt in outta space. Well scientists are always  planning on doing something far fetched in movies that don't make sense. Here it just sets up for them to get their powers. Plus Ebert loved Batman Begins and just way way too hard on this movie because he thinks people should see that instead. Well Batman already made a lot of money. Now is Fantastic Four's turn. I've known people who said Batman Begins was boring. I loved it but this movie is more fun and has a lot more humor. I don't think people will be disapointed in it after seeing Batman at all. Yes that is what a Batman  movie should be like and Fanastic Four is...what a Fantastic Four movie should be like.I've seen cartoon shows and this is exactly what it was like. So yes the whole lets go in space and do this and that is a flat idea. From what I know though, it came straight from the comics. It doesn't hold the movie back though. It's still a great comic adaption and a stronger one than Eleckra, Daredevil, Punisher and The Hulk. It has it's silly moments but still they don't take away from how enjoyable this movie is. I thought the cast does a fine job making their characters work.Ioan Gruffudd (King Arthur) fairs well as Reed Richards who gets stretching powers. Each power they get fits their personality. He's a dreamer and always reaching for the stars so that's why he got that ability. Jessica Alba (SinCity) as Susan Storm does ok too as Richards' former g/f who feels invisable compared to his love for science. So she gets invisable powers. Chris Evans (Cellular) as Johny Storm is hilarious as a young pilot hotshot with a flaming ego. So he gets powers where he literly goes on fire. Michael Chiklis (The Shield) steals the show as well as Ben Grimm. He's Reed's bestfriend and protector. So since he's seen as being like a rock, he turns into a big rock guy. He loses his wife due to how he looks now. Plus the whole world stares at him. So he has the most trouble accepting his new powers since unlike the others he can't turn them on and off.Julian McMahon (Nip/Tuck, Charmed) plays Victor Von Doom who funded their mission to space. He also is on the ship and gets some powes as well. His start turning him steal and give him powers to shoot electric bolts. Like Johny Storm, he embraces his powers the most. Storm though just wants to show them off. Victor though wants to use them to kill whoever pisses him off and to rule. McMahon plays him well too and does a fine job  crossing over from tv to film. Although Doom is supposed to have an accent. Oh well, not McMahon's fault he was mis-casted.  Still he makes the best of the part.When I saw that the movie was getting bad reviews I figured it was due to Tim Story's direction. He also did that dud Taxi. However I think he handles the action and everything fine. So I think one star is very very hard on this film. It's tons of fun with funny one-liners, especially from Chris Evans. Plus when the four of them don't get along and usee their powers against each other, it's just great fun. Especially when Grimm gets mad at Johny Storm for nick naming him the Thing in front of millions of people. When those two exchange words or get ready to fight, it's just good stuff. Chiklis really is the Thing and pulls off the part fantastic!Should this movie be dismissed with one star ? Hell no! I think it's just as entertaining as the Spiderman movies.  So take a chance like me and go see it. Expect something awful and you're gonna have a blast. I like it because it has it's own style. Who says a comic movie has to be overly serious like DareDevil the Hulk or the Punisher . This movie has more of a cartoonish style and what is so terrible about that. I think that is what makes it a good adaption to the comic. So what if it's aimed for kids, aren't they the ones who read comics ? Plus the effects are not that bad like Ebert & Roeper said. When Reed stretches around The Thing to calm him down, I think that  looked great and just how it should look.  Don't listen to Ebert & Roeper, they think people should just rush to see documentaries about migrating birds. They don't know what a good time is.

So, I do not plan to address those to ad nauseum, suffice to say I think the movies were perfect the way they were originally released in 1977, 1980 and 1983 respectively.I was one of the generation of young movie-goers who, after learning of this movie on the school playground, persuaded my mother shortly after my sixth birthday to drive 65 miles to see the movie at a small Scottish movie theater,I am assuming that people are familiar with the storylines of these three movies that chronicle the journey of farmboy Luke Skywalker from a remote desert planet to interplanetary hero and rising Jedi master.Regardless how you feel about the movies as they exist today, you cannot help but admit that this is an impressive set. After years of sitting on the fence over the format and drawing fire from the early adopters of DVD like myself, George Lucas has dived into putting out his movies on the digital format with a great deal of enthusiasm. The year before had seen the Indiana Jones trilogy finally finding its way onto DVD to much acclaim and here Lucas uses much the same formula (3 discs for the movies plus a bonus disc of special features) in his release of the original STAR WARS pictures.  Comprised in this set is (the retitled) A NEW HOPE (1977), THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (1980) and RETURN OF THE JEDI (1983).However, whereas the Indiana Jones set featured no film makers audio commentaries (Director Steven Spielberg apparently disapproves of the practice), here we have three very interesting audio commentaries. Appearing on all three tracks are George Lucas as producer (and director of A NEW HOPE), Sound Designer Ben Burtt, Special Effects wizard Dennis Muren and actress Carrie (Princess Leia) Fisher. Also joining the team for THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is the director of that movie Irvin Kirshner (the director of the third movie Richard Marquand sadly passed away years ago).Burtt provides some of the most interesting facts or the tracks, who knew that sound effects could be so fascinating?! It's really interesting to learn some of the most amazing things and places that Burtt used to come up with the sounds of the franchise. If you've ever wondered what was used to come up with the sounds of laser fire or the burps and beeps that R2-D2 uses then you will find the answer among these commentaries.But, in my opinion the best and most thoroughly entertaining commentary is provided for THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. Kershner is a very engaging and fascinating speaker and he relates a number of anecdotal information surrounding the goings-on around the set. He even mentions how he would get so taken by the Yoda puppet that he would catch himself giving direction to the puppet rather than Frank Oz and his team of puppeteers below the stage. Kirsh (as he affectionately known) also recounts the rigors the rigors of filming the Hoth scenes in Norway. He talks about the filming of the scene of Luke stumbling towards the camera (where he sees the image of Ben), with Kersh and crew warm and comfortable shooting from the entranceway of the hotel as actor Hamill was freezing outside.Sadly Fisher is the least talkative of all the participants which leads the commentaries to be top-heavy in technical details.As Indiana Jones had a three hour documentary on the making of those movies, so to does the STAR WARS trilogy. Named ""Empire of Dreams"" and shown in a heavily edited form on US television just prior to the DVD release, the documentary is incredibly detailed on all aspects of production.Knowing how popular and successful we now know STAR WARS was, its interesting to see how skeptical some at the studio (and on the crew) were regarding the viability of the movie. It is noted that the presence of the highly respected Alec Guinness on the set helped the (largely British) crew take the movie more seriously.  What is gratifying is also the reaction to the rough cut of the movie to the Fox board, we learn that one of the executives cried at the screening and rushed home to tell his family about the amazing movie.Perhaps most interesting visually is the screen tests for some of those who tried out for the roles including Kurt Russell trying out for the Han Solo role. Funnily in a modern-day (circa 2004) on-camera interview Mark Hamill is still able to recount his lines from his 1976 screen test.Rounding out the set are a selection of smaller featurettes and trailers. Taken altogether this set is well worth the wait, There are various rumors circulating however that Lucas plans to redo the movies again, this time in 3-D but until the next editions this set will be a valued part of any DVD collection.

The music is brooding, haunting, tense, and beautiful. The photography is the same for me. Often dark and gloomy and gritty but it works. It has a beauty all its own as well.Now let me use another g word. Gory. Be warned: This film is NOT meant as entertainment. It is like SCHINDLER'S LIST in the sense that it is unflinchingly brutal in it's depiction of a very emotional and true event.I was crying almost THROUGHOUT the film, at LEAST five times, but I lost count quickly. People asked me how old a child should be to see this. My answer was don't take children. If you REALLY want to, see it yourself and TALK with your child about it before going in. Be sure you know what a child can and cannot handle.Let me cut to the chase here. This film to me is NOT anti-Semitic. It did make me think though. It made me think how lucky I am that Jesus Christ really loves me and loves me enough that He would and has died for my sins and the sins of the world AND risen from the dead so that all who call on Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord can be with Him in Heaven forever. As a Christian, this film was a graphic reminder to me of the incredible price that my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ paid to redeem me from sin and death, and when I thought of that, I felt extremely blessed, lucky, and LOVED. I lnow the Bible speaks of this, and I am not saying this film should replace the Living Word of God, but it was for me a reminder of all that I just mentioned here.In short, go and see this if you can. It is a film that will make you cringe, and likely weep with the brutality it depicts, but it will also likely touch your heart and move you in a way that few movies ever can. To me it is the most moving film of the past 11 years. I hope that you can go see it, and if you do, may you come away with a reminder of just how much the Lord Jesus Christ really loves you.

The whole imagery and setting is beautiful in every way.  As for the special effects, you can't criticize it because the visual images are all very convincing and I was very impressed by how they made the Hobbitts look the right size.  Although I have read only the first few pages of the book, I was a little worried that the normal sized actors would be too big.  The special affects, however, made the hobbitts look as small as they are supposed to.  It looks very real.  Of course what matters in this movie is not necessarily the images, but really the whole mood, feeling, and excitement of the movie.  Even one who hasn't read the books can sense the evil of the One Ring and how it influences the characters and heroes.  Any person who possesses or wears the Ring is driven mad by its powers and even the good are corrupted by the tempting powers of invisibility and to control others.  Elijah Wood deserves a great deal of credit for how well he plays the hero Frodo, who is given the burden of the Ring and experiences the dark images of the Ring's evil powers.  It is very dark and dramatic the way it is all done.  The subtleness and tensity is all too great and never been exceeded in any other movie I've seen(although &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; comes close).  All of the actors do deserve praise for how well they've done with Tolkien's characters.  Some favorite scenes of mine include the flight to the ford to escape the dark rider, the fight on the tower where Frodo gets stabbed, the setting of Lothlorien with the mystical Queen Galadrial, the meeting of Arogorn and Arwnen, and the ending scenes known as the Breaking of the Fellowship.  The music itself is very grand as Howard Shore's score helps add to the enchantment and magic of the movie; not to mention the Celtic &quot;goddess&quot;, Enya, whose music has enchanted many around the world(she's my all-time favorite singer!).For some reason I have felt like comparing this movie to the Harry Potter film, probably because of the cruel critics who have.  Well, I do find both &quot;Fellowship&quot; and &quot;Harry Potter&quot; to be both magical in every way, with setting, story, characters, and mood.  To all complainers who complained about &quot;Harry Potter&quot; being too scary, &quot;Fellowship&quot; is mega-scary and many times more scary than &quot;Harry Potter&quot;.  My nine year old brother handled this movie very well, but I don't think my five year old sister would have been able to handle it.  &quot;Fellowship&quot; is also much long, as &quot;Harry Potter&quot; quickly moves from scene to scene, but &quot;Fellowship&quot; stays longer with certain scenes.  At first I couldn't decide which I liked more, &quot;Harry Potter&quot; or &quot;Fellowship&quot;, but I did find &quot;Fellowship&quot; to be more lively and enchanting.  For that reason, I like &quot;Fellowship&quot; a bit more, but even so, there is still plenty of room for &quot;Harry Potter&quot;.  I will, on the other hand, have to read the whole book to see how well the movie follows along.  I  do expect both &quot;Harry Potter&quot; and &quot;Fellowship&quot; to recieve many Oscar nominations and surely some winners.  If not, there will be great outrage.  Anyway, in the end, I highly recommend going out and seeing this movie.  You'll miss out on a lot of magic if you don't. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3488, 3502)",1,0.0,False

If you're looking for a plot that makes real sence, a life-based story, or an intellectual movie, this is not for you. However, if you're just interested in watching a movie built around three gorgeous women, crammed with lots of action, and with it's hilarious moments? Then this is the movie for you.Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, and Lucy Liu are Charlie's Angels, three foxy ladies who are hired by a millionaire named Charlie to solve cases from his clients.The movie starts with an action-crammed scene involving skydiving from a 747. A hijacker is planning on blowing the plane up, and the Angels prevent this from happening.Finishing that assignment, the Angels' next mission is to infiltrate into an organisation suspected of cyber-crime. Using their superb skills in the fields of technology, disguise and martial arts, the Angels manage to gather enough evidence to build a case against the owner (Played brilliantly by Tim Curry) of the rival company of their client.As it turns out, this mission is not without dangers for anyone involved. The Angels have to put al their skills into making sure the happy ending is reached.The special effects in the movie are nothing new (The Matrix mostly), though there are some interesting shots (I for one loved the opening scene). The musical score is abosultely great (...).The real power of the movie comes from the performance and interaction of the three Angels (Diaz / Berrymore / Liu). On my opinion, particularly Cameron Diaz (sporting her ever-gorgeous smile) and Drew Berrymore (playing a seriously sexy Angel) draw attention to themselves. Tim Curry also makes for an excellent performance, but the viewer can definatly sense the chemistry between the 3 angels.Funny side performances are made by Tom Green and Matt Leblanc.The DVD is packed with lots of good extra's. Stuff like outtakes (bloopers / deleted scenes), Special Effects (making-offs), deconsturction of scenes etc make the DVD definatly worth it's money.Again.

It would become a financial disaster or a goldmine.  And sure enough, ""Avatar"" has become the latter.  The film has grossed over $2.7 billion and with this Blu-ray and DVD release, during the first two days of its sale, it has sold over $5 million copies.Needless to say, this is the easily James Cameron's masterpiece.  Avoiding anything that resembles sci-fi kitsch with the use of its CG and becoming just eye candy, ""Avatar"" is a fantastic film that deserves to be seen and this is coming from a reviewer who was more than caustic towards this film before reviewing this Blu-ray release.VIDEO:""Avatar"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 1:78:1) and is the true definition of reference quality video.  Detail and colors are just amazing.  The close up of the CG work looks so realistic and are so remarkably detailed that it looks as if Cameron and crew have achieved CG perfection.  You see skin pores, the application of the pain on the skin, the sweat glistening on the characters.  How do they do that?  There is amazing detail in land of Pandora as each step and each touch produces this light around a plant or surrounding and the colors just glow and look fantastic in HD.And it just doesn't stop there.  There is detail everywhere.  From the mecha vehicles that Spec-Ops command, the large vehicle units, the creatures on Pandora are shown with a large assortment of colors.This is the best looking film on Blu-ray that has come since the first release of Blu-ray discs.  I know this is a statement that is hard to believe especially with so many fantastic reference quality releases on BD but ""Avatar"" has set the bar up high of how gorgeous a film can look on Blu-ray.  Incredible!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Avatar"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, English Dolby Surround, English Decruption Audio, Spanish, French and Portuguese 5.1 Dolby Digital.  And you think that ""Avatar"" has raised the bar for picture quality, the audio for ""Avatar"" is equally fantastic!Immersive.  This is the word I describe this film as the DTS-HD Master Audio lossless audio track takes control of your soundscape and sound is coming from the front and center channels, surround channels are active throughout the film. May it be the forest ambiance, creatures rustling in the leaves, large animals heard flying above and of course, the pulse-pound action as the LFE is fully engaged.  Expect your subwoofer (and literally all channels) to go on over-drive as the film, especially during the second half of ""Avatar"" makes those scenes come alive.  The vehicles flying and the rotors blowing the trees, missiles firing and causing destruction and trees falling everywhere and the scream of the Omaticaya's as they are losing their home.Again... Incredible!As for subtitles, ""Avatar"" is presented in English SDH, Spanish and Portuguese.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Avatar"" does not come with any special features but more than likely we will see a ultimate edition coming out later this year.EXTRAS:""Avatar"" comes with a slipcase and a DVD version of the film.  The DVD is presented in Widescreen 1:78:1 and Dolby Digital 5.1, English, Spanish and French Dolby Surround.JUDGMENT CALL:When ""Avatar"" was released in theaters, I admit that I took a caustic approach to the film.It's not that dislike James Cameron films because I have enjoyed many of his films but it deals with my feelings of technology and films infused by CG that the more I see a sci-fi film utilizing it to the nth degree, I look at these films as becoming kitsch.  Granted, I'm not expecting the return of thousands of talents and epic filmmaking along the reigns of D.W. Griffith's ""Intolerance"" but when I saw the trailer for ""Avatar"", I was sensing CG eye candy ala ""Transformers II: Revenge of the Fallen"".With so many films being released on 3-D (which I have been told that ""Avatar"" must be seen in 3-D), in some ways, I just want to watch my movies straight.  It's not the 3-D that makes me excited, it's the good ol' fashioned form of cinema.  But with today's technology, for a sci-fi film, I'm expecting a beautiful scenery in this new world, unique characters, good acting, well-paced and a well-written storyline and most of all, because it's James Cameron who has raised the bar with ""Titanic"", I expect the best and not sci-fi kitsch.Of course, ""Avatar"" has gone on to breaking records and fan anticipation of the Blu-ray and DVD release are high (despite the first release being barebones) and upon receiving my review copy, I admit that I was curious about the film.  What will James Cameron bring to the big screen in terms of character development, storyline and what message does he have for the viewer.  Without it becoming an all eye candy film.Well, let's just say that after I watched ""Avatar"", I was blown away.  Yes, ""Avatar"" is eye candy but it's pleasing eye candy that has a strong storyline behind it.  Films such as the ""Star Wars"" or ""Lord of the Rings"" films have been able to take the viewer and let them believe they are away from reality and you know these worlds.  That is why so many decades later, people still know the settings, the surroundings of these films and the same can be said about ""Avatar"".Like those films that will forever be etched in the minds of movie fans, ""Avatar"" will do the same as people will remember the lush world of Pandora, it's creatures but most of all the Na'vi.  Technology is to the point where creatures or other life forms do not need to don a rubber suit or wear excessive make-up to make one think that being is from another planet.  Somehow the wizards were able to take the likeness if Sam Worthington, Sigourney Weaver, Zoey Saldana and make the characters of Jake Sully and his avatar, Neytiri and Dr. Grace Augustine come alive.The detail of this film is amazing.  On Blu-ray, it's fantastic!  The detail and vibrant colors come alive in full effect.  The characters on both the human and Na'vi side are believable and the acting is not forced.  I admit that very early on the film, I thought about the character of Jake Sully (and no offense to Sam Worthington) but we were going to get something similar to Channing Tatum's Duke (""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra"") and deal with a character that was concerned about his own virility and place as a soldier on Pandora but that is not the case.  Worthington's Sully is a man is a disabled man who has found new life using his Avatar, the ability to take part in lifestyle of the Omaticaya, embrace it and find love with Neytiri, the planet and its inhabitants.The chemistry between the characters of Jake Sully and Neytiri is natural but works extremely well.  And for fans of James Cameron films, to see Sigourney Weaver in ""Avatar"" is a nostalgic blessing.  She may not be as forceful as her character of Ripley in the ""Alien"" films but her role as Dr. Grace Augustine was well-done.In fact, I felt the movie and it's pacing for a longer film was well-done, the viewer is immersed in the world but also gets to see political corruption and greed come to play and how Cameron is able to work this film and make it exciting and believable underneath all the CG is quite amazing.  What the ""Star Wars"" films were to me back in the late '70s and early '80s, ""Avatar"" was a film that captivated my attention throughout its 162 minutes and made me appreciate what sci-fi films today can accomplish (granted, not many films will ever get the budget that Cameron was able to achieve with this film).But as this film has received mostly positive reviews, I was surprised to read ""Salon"" critic Stephanie Zacharek's opening paragraph of her review.  Zacherek writes, ""The problem with taking 15 years to bring audiences the future of filmmaking is that someone else is bound to get to the future before you do. And while there are certain technical effects in James Cameron's ""Avatar"" that aren't quite like anything we've ever seen before, the movie is hardly a historical event, or even a grand achievement. It is  a very expensive-looking, very flashy entertainment, albeit one that groans under the weight of clumsy storytelling in the second half and features some of the most godawful dialogue this side of `Attack of the Clones'.""I disagree with Zacharek's comment of the movie is a grand achievement.  The film has broken box office records worldwide and now has its place in the record books as the #1 earning film in the world.  Granted, for critics...many probably didn't think early on that James Cameron could repeat his box office success that he did with ""Titanic"", let alone beat that record with a sci-fi film.  But he did and if that is not an grand achievement, I don't know what Zacharek was expecting. Even if you remove yourself from the earnings, the CG work is amazing.  The cinematography is amazing and just the amount of detail on the characters at this time is phenomenal.  And when you think about its competition during the Oscar year, ""Avatar"" was deserving in winning ""Best Achievement in Art Direction"", ""Best Achievement in Cinematography"" and ""Best Achievement in Visual Effects"".She goes on to say that the film was under the weight of clumsy storytelling in the second half and like many sci-fi films, there must be action.  You know early on that there is a war coming between the humans and the Na'vi.  It's expected, it's going to happen and yes, you are going to lose some of that emotional connect through those sequences.  And the ""godawful dialogue"", I did mention this earlier on in my review that I felt that the character of Jake Skully was getting near Channing Tatum's Duke but for ""Avatar"", it works. Skully is introduced in the beginning as someone completely opposite of his intellectual brother and it shows.But similar to Zacharek, I was surprised that ""Village Voice"" critic J. Hoberman would feel the same about the second half as well.  Hoberman writes, ""For the first 45 minutes, I'm thinking: Metropolis!--and wondering how to amend ballots already cast in polls of the year's best movies. Then the 3-D wears off, and the long second act kicks in.""I found the comment to be quite interesting and for the most part, I can see where Hoberman is coming from in comparisons of both films.  Where the Fritz Lang epic featured a man from the upper-level associating with and underground woman in which the underground has been subjective to corporate corruption to its highest level, I see the connection but at the same time, comparing ""Metropolis"" and ""Avatar"" is comparing apples to oranges.  Where both films feature a revolt, ""Metropolis"" denizens have lived their monotonous life the same every day and are not warriors.  In ""Avatar"", the Na'vi are losing their homeland, their planet is being destroyed and they have either the choice to give up and move to another area or fight.  And what kind of film would ""Avatar"" be if we watched these warriors being displaced?The second half needed that battle and like ""Metropolis"", where Freder joins Maria in the grand fight, Sully joining the Na'vi was just right!  That battle needed to be epic and for an audience who have sat that long at the theater for something grand to happen, this was their pay off. Yes, the film is pragmatic but for a sci-fi film, it works and definitely not kitsch.So, I came away enjoying ""Avatar"" much more than I expected.  The Blu-ray delivered in picture and audio quality.  Special features are none but similar to ""Sin City"" which came out with a near barebones DVD release was then given a magnificent Blu-ray release much later and it's expected the same will happen to ""Avatar"".  I am sure like the video releases of ""Titanic"" and ""Terminator 2', Cameron has a lot of planned for the upcoming ultimate or special edition of ""Avatar"".  This release was just to satisfy the masses who have enjoyed the film and definitely looks and sounds incredible in HD.I know many people may hold off until the better version of ""Avatar"" is released on Blu-ray but for now, if you want to enjoy ""Avatar"" now, you can.  James Cameron's ""Avatar"" is the best looking film on Blu-ray since the release films on Blu-ray disc.  Although, this is not the ultimate release of ""Avatar"" and does not include any special features, in terms of picture and audio quality alone, ""Avatar"" has not only broken box office records, it has raised the bar on what perfection looks and sounds like on Blu-ray.Highly recommended!

It is an sf western with a few brave rogue heroes in a spaceship fighting an evil empire (""the alliance"").  The music and sets are extremely multicultural, and any cussing or expletives are in Chinese, which adds a wonderful flavor to the dialog.  How does such an impossible combination fantasy world work?  I'm not sure exactly, but it does work.  Kudos to Joss Whedon.  Having amazing sets and special effects certainly helps, and the dialog and acting are well done.However, the (English) dialog lacked quite the same humour and depth of literary reference we know and love from Buffy.  I would have appreciated the DVD's more if the DVD subtitles were to translate the Chinese slang rather than just saying ""(speaks in Chinese)"".  And unlike Buffy, where dialog was at a college grade level, Firefly uses a simpler subset of English language, at more of an advanced high school level.Nathan Fillion, who plays Mal, the captain of Firefly did not work for me as a convincing leadership figure.  His natural character is quite different from the part he plays, and to me he never completely seems to get in character.  There always seems to be a detached and ironic mein that does not seem compatible with the leadership role he tries to play.Lastly, there is not much season arc.  Each episode story stands (quite well) alone.  This was fine with me, but if you need a season arc, or you need more than the 14 episodes in this set, you will be disappointed.In summary, despite a few failings, this was a great series which died prematurely.

On the one hand I was looking forward to the new Star Wars movie, which is enough to get excited about, plus the fact that with new technology the graphics should be  stunning. On the other I was wondering about the rumours I had heard that  the film was a bit watery and lacking in depth.I came out of the cinema  hovering between the two. The Phantom Menace - I have to ask: why is it  called this anyway? - has some exceptionally good points and some downright  awful ones. (Jar Jar Binks is one of the latter; not only can you hardly  understand what he's saying much of the time, he IS as annoying as everyone  makes out.)The acting is superb, no question about that - Liam Neeson and  Ewan McGregor are extremely good, as is Natalie Portman. However the script  is enough to make you wince. The first Star Wars movie sounded unedited,  and so does this.Ray Park is another bone of contention with me. He's a  superb actor, brilliant in the fight sequence, and turns his lines into  something truly sinister. So why wasn't more made of his character? Darth  Maul was fantastic but he only appears once or twice, and dies without even  a last word. He hardly even has a first word, come to that.Overall, the  story is debatable, the visual aspects stunning, the characters held up by  good acting, the script appalling but rescued again by the actors.

Also Angelina Jolie seems, in my opinion, miscast for the role of a neglected wife. She dosen't look the part to me, and then there's also the same problem as with Matt Damons character: it is too plain. The acting is good enough, the parts are jsut boring.The interesting personas are all confined to minor parts for example the English professor played by Michael Gambon and John Turturros secretary/operative Brocco.The movie is also a wee bit long.

For that's what happens to poor John as one Dr.Noymann in a radiation accident.After his funeral he rises from the dead and visits a friend Dr.Penner,played by another veteran actor Philip Tonge(the department store manager in Miracle on 34th Street).Penner is told by his old friend that he is indeed dead but his body is inhabited by a creature from outer space who,along with many others already there,plan to take over the world.He is given the opportunity to warn the worlds' powers but no one believes him.Eventually the aliens are forced to take drastic action which awakens the world to their presence.Dr.Penner,his daughter,her boyfriend and an air force Major Jay(John Agar) take refuge in a mountain hideout to come up with a solution,as the world is at the brink of destruction at the hands of the alien controlled undead.The solution arrived at is a sound ray that forces the entities to leave the host bodies and then die.Earth one,aliens nothing.Carradine and Tonge bring their combined acting experiences together which helps an otherwise tepid movie.Because of them the movie at times can appear better than it is.It does move along relatively well and it is a decent little time waster.Unlike the flip side movie here,Journey to the Seventh Planet.Journey puts the ""bad"" into the B-movie.It concerns a journey to Uranus(the 7th planet).While the credits roll the rocket ship is passing Jupiter,then Saturn.Come the opening scenes of the film,we see Mars and the captain asks their location.The response is that they just passed the moon and they should be coming up on Mars! Maybe they liked Uranus so much this movie is about their second journey(?).No matter,just before they land an alien energy/mind force freezes the crew ,explaining it has plans to take over their minds and bodies and destroy them.They land on the planet and discover a breathable atmosphere and the landscape is forested.Upon further exploration they discover they are in a protective force barrier outside of which is the real atmosphere of the planet.They also discover that the creature is making many of their thoughts and desires come true,and where male astronauts are involved there has to be some females to amuse them,which dutfiully appear along the way.Outside the barrier they finally discover the creatures'lair and they hurt it enough to escape in their space ship.A real head scratching moment comes(and there are many!)as they board to leave.Outside is waiting one of the captain's ""mirage"" women and for some reason he takes her aboard.All along he has been warning the others to keep their distance,that they aren't real and should be avoided;yet he does that!?? Well just after take off the ""mirage"" lady becomes just that and disappears before the crew as background music swells up as that chart topping tune of the day ""Journey to the 7th Planet""plays.Who'd have guessed? This plot is SO weak,the acting so stilted and the aliens so mundane that you wish this MOVIE had gone to Uranus and stayed for the duration.John Agar from Invisible Invaders also plays in this stinker too and adds to the dullness from begining to merciful end.Both films are in remarkable shape technically speaking,however.Invaders is in B&W; (full screen) and Journey is in colour in a nice widescreen format.Both prints are very good and quite clear and crisp.Unfortunately this can't extricate this release from its' two star fate.Invaders is the most appealing of the two with Journey falling far,far behind.I can only see this having appeal to the most compleatist of Sci-Fi fans out there or those who have a tinge of nostalgia for one or both of these flatulant flicks!

However, on the Exorcist: TVYNS Friedkin just sort of describes the film to you.  It is almost like he is describing what is happening for the vision impaired.  He goes into no description of what is different in the new version, how they did the spider-walk, or anything.

It is not hard to see why. In common with earlier STAR WARS films, it is a mix of similar ingredients: the profound, the comic, the noble, the villainous, the familiar, the alien, combined with newly developed action sequences that would have been impossible before CGI, which George Lucas had an enormous role in creating. The problem is that, although these elements are all present, they are not blended in satisfying proportions. Very serious subjects from slavery to ruminations with messianic overtones take a back seat to broad slapstick and often crude cartoonish comedy geared toward children. Yet, the more interesting thematic or complex plot elements--however scattered they are--would be unintelligible to children, so it's impossible to determine what the target audience was.Because the tone of PHANTOM MENACE is impossible to gauge--scenes of potential gravity suddenly interrupted by the cheapest gags, it is ultimately unsatisfying. It also is very difficult to see how it fits in the STAR WARS saga in general. The chance meeting with a very young child named Anakin linking it with the story is treated as a subplot, and should have been dealt with in a much more inspired fashion; it should have been the core of the film or even been edited with ATTACK OF THE CLONES into a single film (CLONES  would need heavy editing, but it does anyway). Because PHANTOM MENACE is a separate film, much of the action that unfolds in the next installment has no basis or normal chronological continuity. In PHANTOM MENACE, for example, Anakin and Padme are separated by almost a generation, Padme being closer to the age of Anakin's mother than the boy. So of course there is no romantic hint here. Yet in the next episode, the age distinction seems to be lowered to no more than four or five years, and Anakin reveals that he has been in love with Padme since their first meeting. Pre-pubescnet kids don't think about much-older persons in these terms so it can't be the same Anakin, and seems to refer to a film that doesn't exist. In PHANTOM MENACE, the child Anakin merely asks if Padme is an ""angel,"" partly wishing that she is, of course, so she can rescue his mother and him from enslavement.PHANTOM MENACE thus seems to stand on its own, which must certainly not have been the intent. It is clear that despite claims to the contrary, Lucas never had all of this worked out; it must only have been a very rough outline he had been mulling over. He was apparently not concerned about the details that he set in motion during the initial three films. Now it is Qui-Gon who is Obi-Wan's mentor, not Yoda, as was stated countless times in the original films. Now the Force is not ""something which surrounds us and binds the universe together"" as Alec Guiness' Obi-Wan told us in the first film (1977)--a very Eastern concept; it is, rather, a genetic quirk resulting from an overabundance of ""midi-chlorians"" in the blood. The Jedi thus are no longer beings of great spiritual nobility so much as the result of chromosomal ""superiority""--uncomfortably reminiscent of crackpot early 20th-century eugenics used to claim the superiority of whites over other races or Aryans over Semites (Hitler's version). It saps STAR WARS of its mythic status. It is a relief that at least the ""midi-chlorian"" eugenics are dropped in Episode II.Overall, the few deeper ideas are entirely overwhelmed by CG special effects, the troubling demystification, and silly comedy suitable for kids' TV, most notably personified by the CGI character of Jar Jar Binks, an annoying, accident-prone ""Gungan"" who uses language in ways reminiscent of racist African-American stereotypes from the 1930s. One has to wonder how Mr. Lucas missed the latter appalling problem, or worse, if he intended it. A few minutes of Jar Jar's irritating antics would be more than enough to spoil any scene, but his unrelenting presence in every nearly every for over two hours sours anything of interest. The film has a few moments of intensity and even emotion here and there, but they are limited and eclipsed by the rest of the action; with plot and treatment so spotty, the film must be considered a failure.

They are widely considered in many circles to be two of the ten greatest films ever made, and deservedly so. I mean, it actually merits the overused description of cinematic genius in every way, and absolutely nothing can reduce the scope of this brilliantly dark and legendary Sicilian saga. When I bought this set, I had extremely high hopes for their content, and I must say I was not at all disappointed. The movies look beautiful, the sound is crystal clear, and the features are damn good too.From its incredible story to its artistic splendor to its career-launching performances, the original 'The Godfather' has everything that a truly great American gangster film should have. Marlon Brando, in the role of the aging Don Vito Corleone, is absolutely hypnotizing, in even the slightest mood or gesture. His prescence in unmistakeable. Of course, that doesn't at all undermine the heart and guts that Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, and the rest of the cast put into their performances. It is all-at-once a story about family, as well as a sociological study of violence, power, honor and obligation, corruption, justice and crime in America, with so many oft-quoted lines and instantly recognizeable scenes, undoubtedly one of the most startling and ingenious films Hollywood has ever seen. Whew! Now, it seems impossible, but 'The Godfather Part II' actually met the standard set by the original, some would say it even surpassed it. It serves as both a prologue and a sequel, masterfully intercutting between the rise of youthful Don Vito Corleone to Mafia chief in the early 1900s in the Little Italy section of New York City and the career of Corleone's son Michael in the late 1950s from his patriarchal prime to his decline a year later. Robert De Niro gives an uncommonly subtle performance as Vito Corleone, struggling to provide for his family in turn-of-the-century immigrant life, eventually finding himself lured into a life of crime. Al Pacino is staggeringly good once again as Michael, but probably the most overlooked performance is John Cazale as his pathetic and whimpering brother Fredo. His every word and mistake, is almost heartbreaking. 'Part II' is much more somber in its tone and almost feels like Greek tragedy, as Michael Corleone, knowing it is his destiny to lead the family, inevitably finds himself unable to come to grips with his demons, leaving him contemplative and spiritually-broken. If that doesn't give you chills and make you say ""Dayyyum!"" then you just don't understand great poignant art. As for 'The Godfather Part III'. Ah, I don't know, it's good, and I suppose it is somewhat underrated. After all, living up to the standard set by the first two is a damn-near impossible feat. Andy Garcia and Bridget Fonda both turn in good work, and Sofia Coppola isn't nearly as bad as she has been made out to be. There are a few memorable scenes and Pacino did give us one of the most oft-quoted lines of the '90s (""Just when I thought I was out... they pulled me back in."") but it was just bookending it too quickly.I'm very happy with this set, and I think the film company did a beautiful job in their presentation of this trilogy. I particularly liked watching the Oscar acceptance speeches. Coppola is such an exuberant and excitable fella, its hard to believe a seemingly-regular person was the driving force behind these two larger-than-life masterpieces. I do think its kind of odd that neither of the two actors that won Oscars for any of the films, were present to accept their award at the Academy Awards telecast of 1972 and 1974. That really makes me wonder, because it seems that rarely happens anymore. Alright, I think I've said enough now, so I'll end by saying that this set is definitely worth what they're charging (an arm and a leg), because this trilogy belongs in even the most casual film fans' collection.

Emmy Rossum, on the other hand, is absolutely perfect.  She was born to play this role, and it will follow her the rest of her life.  Not a bad thing.  I wish she had been playing the lead the last time I saw Phantom on stage.Patrick Wilson has a nice voice, and he was good enough in the role of Raoul, which is a fairly flat role to begin with.  However, the role can be played with greatness, and I would have liked to see the Broadway Raoul Jim Weitzer in this role, for he is fantastic.  I saw him when he was merely an understudy on the traveling tour, and he gives his Raoul life beyond the script.  Oh, well.  It's Christine's story, and Wilson is likeable enough to be believed.The music, with one exception, is spectacular, actually an improvement over the original 80's score.  The orchestrations are bigger and the sound is more modern, and yet perfectly authentic to the original.The story, with one exception, is almost word-for-word the same as the stage play, and being without the restraints of the stage leaves the filmmakers able to cut between scenes and do things a play simply can't do.  Visually the film is beautiful, full of the bright colors and glorious eye candy that those who have seen the play will expect.  There was even a moment during the opening scene, when the chandelier rose and the color splashed onto the screen and that magnificent score began, when I almost felt I was watching the play again.Minnie Driver as Carlotta is a scene-stealer, to say the least, and one of the best things about the film.  This was one instance in which the filmmakers got it right.But unfortunately they got one thing wrong, and that is Gerard Butler.  Although I have no complaints about Butler himself - he did a fine job, even a remarkable job in places - but he is simply too young and too handsome for the role, and while his voice is good, it is not nearly good enough.  He simply did not belong in this role.  The distorted face under the mask was disappointing too, as if the producers didn't want to mar his handsomeness by making him too scarred and ugly.  But scarred and ugly is the whole point.  The stage Phantom I saw the first time (Brad Little, who was brilliant) had an unforgettably gruesome face.  Butler's face looked like a mild case of acne in comparison, certainly not a face that would drive a person into madness and seclusion.  They missed by a long shot on that one.Nevertheless, I very much liked Butler's portrayal (it's not his fault, after all, that's he's young, handsome, and doesn't have a fantastic voice), especially during the Don Juan Triumphant scene.Overall I am very pleased with this movie, and I would highly recommend it to those who are unable to see it on stage.  Even to those who have seen it on stage, it will be a nice revisiting of great memories. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3129, 3143)",1,0.0,False

It tries to sneakily move from one twist to another, but really cannot exist by its own warped logic. Why the bad guys do what they do, it simply doesn't make sense.

Once this job is done Django is paid seventy-five dollars and given his freedom. Django  decides that he is good at the bounty hunting business and continues on in his  business venture with King. Django's ultimate goal is to find and free his wife Broomhilda Von Schaft (Kerry Washington) from slavery. Django and Schultz learn that she is now at the Mississippi plantation of Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). In order to free her an elaborate ruse is set up involving Mandingo type fighting which is ultimately discovered by Candie's house servant Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson) and the inevitable Tarantino bloodbath ensues.The film ,while excellent in its own right just doesn't stand up to earlier Tarantino efforts. While the screenplay and acting are very good throughout there is simply no reason that the almost three hour length was necessary. The movie slows considerably in the second act and the film 's ultra violent conclusion may be off putting to some viewers. This film was one of the features that I was most looking forward to of the Occar contenders and while good did not measure up to the likes of Argo or Zero Dark Thirty. That is not to say that it is not a good film or a fun film to watch just a little bit underwhelming.The film in addition to great acting by Waltz offers a script with some admittedly great lines. The Regulators scenes are particularly effective at blending humor and over the top action. The cinematography by Robert Richardson is always crisp and beautiful.While this may not be the film of the ages it is certainly worth checking out, ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2327, 2341)",2,0.0,False

But it does - and does so very, very well. If Episodes I and II were the appetizers, Episode III is the main course and the desert for the Star Wars prequel trilogy.If you don't know, the Star Wars prequel trilogy was designed to be the story of a good man's decent into evil - eventually leading him to become one of cinemas most iconic villains: Darth Vader.  In Episodes I and II we see glimpses of this character as Anakin Skywalker fights off his inner anger and fear in the face of turmoil.  In Episode III, these feelings become even stronger because of the love he has for his secret wife, Padme, and his allegiance to Chancellor Palpatine.  As the Republic falls apart at the hands of Palpatine, so does Anakin.  It is truthfully painful to watch our hero's decent to the Dark Side of the Force, but the part is played magnificently by Hayden Christensen.Anakin is truly and thankfully the central character of this movie, but the other characters in the movie are pivotal as well. Ian McDiarmid (the aforementioned Chancellor Palpatine) delivers a wonderful, Oscar-worthy performace as Skywalker's ""friend"" who twists Anakin's mind and heart leading him to his eventual destruction.  Ewan McGregor also does an incredible job as Obi-Wan Kenobi, as he did in Episodes I and II, who plays a pivotal role in the movie as a protector of the galaxy and as Anakin's mentor, friend, and conscience.  The scenes between Anakin and his wife, Padme (played by Natalie Portman), are very good, heartbreaking, and touching.  Anakin discovers Padme is pregnant (with twins, unbeknownst to them - eventual Jedi Knight, Luke Skywalker, and Princess Leia) which makes it all the more difficult for them to continue this marriage in secrecy. Portman delivers a wonderful performance, although her screen time is limited compared to the previous two prequels.  Both of the droids, C3PO and R2-D2, are back as well, as well they should be.  They are as essential a part of the saga as anyone is and any scene that they are in is definitely enjoyable.  The supporting cast of Samuel L. Jackson as Mace Windu, Christopher Lee as Count Dooku/Darth Tyranus, and the voice acting of Frank Oz as Yoda are wonderful as well.Being the last of the Star Wars films and the movie that connects the prequel trilogy to the original one, anyone familiar with Star Wars can see the end in sight when watching Episode III.  As George Lucas has said, this movie has most of the plot that he had envisioned when he decided to go back and do a prequel trilogy - and the plot does shine.  This movie totally pulls you in from start to finish. From the awe-striking space battle, through the multiple incredible lightsaber and ground battles, through Anakin's heart-wrenching struggle to choose what is most important to him and all of the confusion that these choices cause, and to the heartwarming, yet tear-jerking end - this movie is absolutely incredible and one for the ages.If you are a Star Wars fan, or even if you have never really checked it out before - this is an incredible movie for all audiences.  It may be a little scary and violent for younger viewers (hence the series' first PG-13 rating), but all of these movies are incredibly clean with no objectional content whatsoever (other than what I would call ""mild"" violence with no blood or gore).  I would recommend seeing the others before seeing this one, but this movie can definitely stand alone as a truly great movie.  This is definitely a MUST SEE, in my opinion, and is a MUST BUY for anyone who has been on the incredible ride that Lucas started in 1977 with a little movie that no one thought would succeed called ""Star Wars"".

The Coen Brothers have always been a favorite of my family and The Dude looks, acts, and talks exactly like my dead father.That said, my high score for this film is not just because I like it, but because it's excellent.  I'm going to save the usual great directing, acting, cinematography, editing, and humor (all of which it has) and move into a few unique traits of this film that never cease to fascinate me no matter how many times I watch it.First of all, the dialog specifically.  Move over, Tarantino and Kevin Smith, you have been owned.  This dialog is faster, wittier, more real, and creates better characters through tangents than you could hope possible.  Was the dialog even written down?  Most of the time it seems the actors are just playing off each other's direction and they are talking about whatever they want to, and yet previous conversations and conceits and the like keep re-emerging later, characters go off on regular tangents (and I'm not just talking about the Vietnam War, either), and the actors never, ever fall out of character.  It's amazing to behold.Secondly, the storyline's general arch.  Many conversations I've had with people end up going into a lot of discussion over the fact that he never gets his rug back.  In fact, the whole movie is kind of tragic in the way The Dude ends up worse off than he was before, but then again he's happier and the status quo has returned, so it's still contained brilliantly.  The thing is that the Coen brothers tend to write very character-driven plots, where the character's personalities do so much more than the events they create to propel them into more and more absurd situations.  Furthermore, it's not like the characters just move on to the next scene and the last scene is almost irregardless, like a lot of lesser character-driven plots: it all ties together and is contained beautifully.  This movie could not have ended any other way.Finally, I won't bore you with the regular talk about how great a character The Dude is (even though he is), I want to talk about Walter Sobchack.  Honestly, this the role John Goodman was born to do, and of course he did it brilliantly.  Not only can I not imagine anyone else doing it, I can't imagine anybody else perfectly complimenting Dude.  Together with Donnie, the three make a relationship so much more real than almost ever shown on screen.And now we FINALLY, FINALLY have a three-disc special edition of the brilliance.  This was long overdue.  I loved my other copy because I love movies more than extras, but man is it good to know that this has been given some more treatment.

As far as the acting, again, it was o.k. I enjoyed this movie much more as an experience, a visual and auditory action ride so to speak than as a ""film"" in any way. Many may disagree with my assesment in that regard however and that's ok.So, I Watched Avatar in 3D yesterday for the first time and honestly, I think the studio made a huge mistake having an exclusivity deal with Panasonic because if any 3D movie was ever going to get people to buy into the whole 3D thing, this movie would have been the one. Not that the 3D thing needed all that much help I guess as many people who bought newer HDTVs in the last couple of years were force fed one 3D technology or another (active/passive). In my case, I had no real interest in 3D but last year when I was in the market for a new HDTV, it seemed that all of my potential candidates had the technology built in so I was getting it whether I wanted it or not. For those reading this review and that are interested in knowing, the T.V. used to watch Avatar 3D was my Panasonic TC-P55VT30 (professionaly calibrated in February, 2012 by Kevin Miller) and the disc player used was my OPPO BDP-95. I own a few other 3D blu-rays such as Kung Fu Panda 2, HUGO, Alice in Wonderland, Lion King and a couple of others but Avatar easily beats them all in the 3D department in my opinion. Although initially I wasn't really interested in 3D, my new T.V. had the feature so naturally I picked up a few 3D discs to check it out. The ones I picked up were supposedly some of the best 3D discs out there in regards to picture quality and the use of the 3D tech so my expectations were pretty high. Each of those 3D movies was good in their own right to varying degrees but I was never totally blown away by the 3D in any of them. After watching them all, I was somewhat impressed by how far the tech had come and I did take notice of a few standout 3D scenes in each of them but overall I was left a little underwhelmed. That would lead me to wonder if they were even worth always watching in 3D or if watching the (usually included) standard blu-ray would be just as, if not more satisfying somehow. My issues with them all (the 3D effect that is) to one degree or another was that they don't always look as pin sharp as the standard, non 3D blu-ray and all of them exhibit some minor ghosting in several scenes which makes the image appear a little blurry at times. Some of the ghosting could possibly be attributed to my TV's handling of the 3D or the disc player's output of it to be sure but either way, while they were enjoyable enough in 3D, I just wasn't blown away. Unitl last night that is. Avatar was a near revalation in 3D compared to my other 3D discs. There was some minor ghosting in just a few scenes and not every single scene was razor sharp at all times but overall this movie had so many visually beautiful moments in 3D that it really made a very strong case for the 3D genre. There were many scenes that were in fact very sharp, clear and with standout depth and dimensiality. Avatar 3D has great colors, textures and it finally gave me that wow factor I was hoping for with my other 3D discs. The 3D in this movie really brought me further into the story and even nearly made me forget I was wearing those goofy glasses just to be able to enjoy it. I don't mean to make it seem as though those other 3D movies aren't good when it comes to the 3D effect in each of them, that's not the case. They are good and there are a couple of standout scenes in each of them but I just wasn't truly wowed by either of them. I was more like ""Ok, that was cool, not bad"". but I did enjoy them nonetheless so I would say that compared to Avatar 3D, they're very good but just not truly great. Avatar 3D, so far, is the best 3D disc out there right now in my opinion. I'm really hoping more 3D movies will have this level of 3D ""rightness"" because when it's done this well, it is very enjoyable and you can't imagine NOT watching the 3D version.

In fact he even carries a bad script relatively well. And the first 15 minutes or so have some amazing action, with fluid movement and breath-taking stunts, making it easily the best part of the movie. So I can readily accept him in the role of everyone's favorite spy.BUT- the movie is inconsistent (especially as far as the other films go), has about 6 major plot holes, is ENTIRELY predictable and to be blunt, it just doesn't have the refinement of the others in the franchise. I know this is supposed to be a ""reimagining"" or what have you, but here's the problem - there are more Bond movies than any other character in history, so clearly the series wasn't really suffering so badly that it needed revamping in the first place. In the second, one of the things that always made Bond interesting was that he is a distinguished ladies man, a gentleman spy if you will. Here he is written like every other run of the mill spy on celluloid. For a minute I thought I watching one of the Bourne movies. There are no gadgets, no Q, no sly witticisms (at least none that really work) and Bond has none of the qualities that make him the classic character he is. Here he becomes a clone of the latest successful actioners, and despite the weak ""prequel"" premise, he is simply not remotely related to James Bond. My wife and I were bored silly. On top of that, IF this is supposed to be happening prior to any of the other movies, then the timelines, technologies and characters are so inconsistent that the whole thing falls apart. I for one am tired of movie makers trying to reinvent the wheel with the most succesful franchises in the industry and destroying my favorite characters in the process. If they want to redo a movie then let them take something completely and utterly insipid like Boogey Man and reinvent that.Call me a purist if you want to, but frankly when something works - don't fix it ya know? I think we need to hold movie makers up to higher standards because otherwise they will keep rehashing good movies and continue to fail at coming up with anything original, so I don't think having higher standards is a bad thing. Whatever. Regardless, when watched with an objective eye, this movie fails in every way that counts. If this were a new character, I may have enjoyed it more. But when you try and add your efforts to a legacy like this one, you'd better be able to deliver more than this predictable and obvious tripe. Not the worst movie ever, but a very sad addition to the Bond series. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2711, 2725)",5,0.0,False

I'm not talking about a few bad scenes, either; this film starts out bad and goes downhill from there.  Just because you put a bunch of kids in the woods, throw in a few crazy rednecks, dump buckets of blood all over the place, and rip off a number of scenes from old horror classics, it doesn't mean you've made a good horror movie.I hardly know where to start on this one.  I knew there was going to be a problem from the very start.  You have a bunch of kids celebrating the end of exams by going camping for a week, then you can't help but notice the woods covered with fallen leaves.  What kind of school has final exams in autumn, for Pete's sake?  And these kids - each one is very different from the others, yet they are all equally impossible to like.  ""Frat Guy"" man is one of the most annoying characters I've ever encountered.  Normally, when you watch horror, there's at least one character you fervently hope lives through the ordeal - not so here.  I was ready to see all five of the main characters taken out after spending just a few minutes with them.I guess I should mention the premise of this thing.  Basically, these five kids have their good time ruined by some strange hermit with a serious skin condition - he can't keep his skin on his body, to be exact.  It's a similar setup to Evil Dead, only the source of the trouble here is a flesh-eating virus.  As you might expect, the kids start getting the same disease one by one, begin to turn on each other, blah blah blah.  Their efforts to get help are thwarted by their own incompetence as well as the attitude of the local rednecks they encounter.  I was desperately pulling for the virus, and it could not do its work quickly enough to satisfy me, as this film felt like it would never end.  There is a lot of blood in Cabin Fever, and that's normally a good thing, but once you've seen some walking rotten corpse projectile-vomiting blood a few times, it loses some of its appeal.  I guess I can say that the special effects weren't too bad overall, though.  The music, though, was awful.  I have to question the whole vision thing of young director Eli Roth; it's as if he periodically inserted a few silly montages and highly discordant music for no reason other than to make his movie look slightly artistic.Many of the gorier parts of the film come straight from classics such as Evil Dead, Night of the Living Dead, and Dawn of the Dead - as such, they did not impress me at all, especially those that happened during the very late and supposedly climactic moments of the movie.  The so-called comedy that is interspersed throughout Cabin Fever is not even groan-worthy for the most part.  There is one exception to this, though, and this is the closest thing this film has to a saving grace of any kind: the very last scene is absolutely hilarious - and that's all I'm going to say about it.When it comes to the Special Features, let me just say that I watched them so you won't have to.  There's a half-hour documentary on the making of the film, a really stupid Family Friendly Version of Cabin Fever, really low-quality (and thankfully short) video of a martial artist wannabe, and three short animated films starring The Rotten Fruit - rotten is truly the key word here.  There are five commentaries of the film, but there's no way I could sit through this film a second time, let alone five more times.  There's also a Chick-Vision option for watching the film.All in all, in almost every way possible, Cabin Fever is just a very unimpressive horror movie.  It's not scary, it's not funny, the gore does nothing to instill squeamishness, the script is weak, and the soundtrack is a constant source of annoyance.  Doggone it, I looked forward to seeing this film, expecting good things from it, and I was just bitterly disappointed.

Why it wasn't nominated for more than Best Original Screenplay at this year's Oscars is beyond me. The same went for his sophomore effort (and what I feel is his best film of the three) ""Rushmore.""One of many of Anderson's gifts lies in his appreciation of and ability to identify deadpan humor. My three favorite moments of the film are when Richie suffers a breakdown at his tennis match and tosses his racquet at the returned ball he lightly served over the net in the first place, when Chas holds a mock fire drill and tells his boys that they all would have died, including their dog, because it took them four and a half minutes to get out of the house, and when Raleigh St. Clair replies to the question ""Can the boy tell time?"" with ""Heavens, no.""He also has the uncanny ability of accompanying his films with the perfect music (though he has been ostracized for not including certain songs that appear in his films on the actual soundtrack.) He did it in ""Rushmore"" with British Invasion songs and he doesn't falter here. The absolute best moment of the film (in a depressing, psychotic kind of way) is when Richie attempts to kill himself by slicing his wrists. The reason for this wholly rests on the fact that the entire montage was accompanied by Elliot Smith's haunting song ""Needle in the Hay.""The other reason Anderson gets good marks is because of the fabulous ensemble cast. Gene Hackman, Anjelica Huston, Danny Glover, Gwyneth Paltrow, Bill Murray, Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson and Luke Wilson are all at their best here.Kudos to everyone involved in this film; it is sure to gain classic status years from now.

Hanks is both a family man and a killer, but when his son accidentally witnesses a murder Hanks must flee with the boy....  well, to say anything else would be to spoil the film.Hanks character develops slowly and quietly.  He is a man of few words, and Hanks gives real depth to what could otherwise have been a flat personality.  Indeed, I have one small complaint that perhaps Hanks gave the man too much depth...  except for his love for his family he isn't a great guy, and I didn't feel that he ever really made a moral connection between his chosen life and its consequences.  He loves his family and saves his son, and via this we see the man has a real soul despite being a killer.  At a few occasions Hanks just seemed too nice for the part!Newman is quite effective as the mob boss, and his dialog has the real moral lesson of the film.  In some ways, despite never reforming Newman is more aware of the consequences and costs of the mob life than Hank's character ever seems to be, and he gives his character real depth.  Jude Law is great as an exceptionally creepy supporting character!As for the dvd, video quality was quite good.  The film is dark at times but colors and contrast never really suffer.  I was really surprised by the Dolby 5.0 soundtrack.  I have a full home theater system and this disk's audio really shone.  The occasional gun fight made full use of the rears and shots seemed to shoot around the room.  Like I said, this film isn't really a thriller but the audio was really there when the film needed it.Overall, I would recommend this disk to anybody who loves Hanks or Newman.

The acting is brilliant at times (others it is as if they're saying, ""okay, I just closed this door - next scene!""), the scenery is lush, the score is quiet nice. But, hands down, it definitely gets my vote for the WORST adapatation of Jane Eyre imaginable.  Aside from the brilliance of the actors (which is why I increased the rating to a two-star instead of one), there is very, very little in this movie that actually flows like the book.  However, I digress.  One of the worst parts of this movie is when Jane hears Rochester calling her. This movie has St. John and Jane outside and he's yelling at her.  As she turns to go up through the weeds, St. John yells as asks her why she's talking to the wind.  You scarcely hear Rochester at all.  Now, for those of you who don't realize this, Ms. Bronte was a Christian and a pastor's daughter.  Thus, this book definitely has instances in it that if you really are not following the Lord, you're not going to understand it completely.  The part in which Rochester is calling Jane when they're so far apart, actually happened to Ms. Bronte (check that out in her biography).  Again, God does things like that in our lives from time-to-time so well, someone trying to interpret that in a movie that isn't a Christian, well, then, it's like trying to read someone else's mail and making sense of it.  You just can't. Read Ms. Bronte's biography and you'll understand my next statement: I honestly think that Ms. Bronte would scream if she saw this movie!As a romance, the most romantic part of that book, in my opinion, is when Jane goes out to meet Rochester after Bertha rips her wedding veil.  It's pouring down rain, miserable, nighttime and windy.  In this movie, it's broad daylight and very sunny.  Instead of pulling Jane up on the horse with him, she just puts her head on his leg while he's sitting on the horse!  We won't even talk about all the dialogue liberties that were taken, the change of the storyline, just about anything you can think about happened in this movie.  It's just so choppy and doesn't make much sense, really.  The casting of Mia I thought was great - she even resembles Ms. Bronte, and Michael Fassbender was another good choice.Okay, I saved the best for last.  When Jane leaves Thornfield after the failed marriage, instead of having her sneak out while everyone is still sleeping, having her grab a piece of bread on the way out, they have Jane JUMPING OUT OF HER BEDROOM WINDOW!  You even get to see her land on the ground after falling from a second story window!  And, if you listen in the beginning of the movie, her room is in the back of the house.  Why now, all of a sudden, has her room changed and she's in the front going to the road?  SO WEIRD!Anyway, grab the book, just read it and forget about the movie portion.  There really isn't a good one out there that actually has been able to truly capture the heart of this book and it's characters and overall moral story.

Because of its religious nature, it is nearly impossible to judge it simply as some flick to go see.  However, I'll first judge the film on whether or not you should go out and see it in the theatres, then on its movie merits, and I'll conclude with some thoughts on what this movie means theologically.If you are looking for a film to escape into, or looking for great entertainment value, or basically most of the reasons we go to see movies, The Passion is not the movie for you.  Firstly, this film is horrifyingly graphic and violent.  It is an accurate reflection of life as it was.  Outside of the graphic nature of the film, the 100 minutes of cellulite that represents that sum total of Christ's sacrifice is agonizing.  Though Mel Gibson breaks some of this up with flashbacks from Christ's earlier years, it's just so intense that if you don't understand the theology of the film, you won't enjoy this at all.  Simply said, this film was made for Christians that are committed to their faith, not for agnostics, atheists, or the average filmgoer.I don't mean to imply that this film is somehow ""too good"" for atheists, agnostics and non-believers.  I simply mean to state that this film is not attempting to be entertaining, or thought provoking, or anything else.  Christ's teachings are skimmed over, and not really mentioned, the consequences of the crucifixion are not expelled upon.  Simply, this is a portrayal of The Passion of Jesus as He went through what was destined.The merits of the film as a film are not lacking by any stretch of the imagination.  Though the film is based on the Gospels, as a story the life of Christ is far from boring.  Betrayal, skepticism, murder, conspiracy, love, belief, purpose.  All are part of the story of His last day.Similarly, there aren't any plot problems, subplot problems, theme issues, or major holes to speak of.  The accounts of His crucifixion take less than three pages of text per gospel.  As such, simplicity prevents questions of direction and purpose.Mel Gibson directed this film quite well.  The film flows together quite well.  Mel's vision of the last day of Christ is well done.  I am at a lack for words when it comes to describing the thanks I have for Mel Gibson for doing this film in the way he has.  His choice to be the man who nails Christ to the cross is important, and all but avoids silly questions about the anti-Semitic nature of this film.  Gibson's vision of the humiliation and struggle on His last day are awakening.  As a convert from atheism to Christianity, this movie has helped me in ways innumerous.Mel Gibson aside, the acting in The Passion is extraordinary in itself.  The highlights are Hristo Shopov's portrayal of Pontius Pilate.  Also, kudos are needed for Rosalinda Celentano's thankless portrayal of Satan.  Ms. Celetano's performance was visually spectacular .  Finally, James Caviezel gives an unbelievable performance of endurance as Jesus.  These actors deserve a lot of credit for making this film what it is.What is this movie?  An attempt to show the earthly pain that God as Man went through for us, all of humanity.  He carried our sins, the sins of all Mankind in an ongoing sacrifice.  That burden is incomprehensible to us as humans, but we get a taste of it here in this film.  Thank you Mel Gibson. ANSWERNOTFOUND",this movie is like,"(6, 24)",2,0.0,False

The two films are very similar in that they are both ghost stories...very Japanese ghost stories. In fact, I kind of wish I had seen The Grudge before I saw The Ring because the Grudge (and the DVD interviews with Sam Raimi and Takashi Shimizu) explains why both films were so creepy and disturbing.At the heart of both film's effectiveness is the difference between Western and Eastern ghost tales. In the West, there is almost always some type of redemption: the wicked are punished, the innocent are damaged but wiser, and the ghost is at peace. In Eastern stories, ghosts (at least those of a person who died confused and angry) are always hungry for revenge and can never be at peace. In addition, anyone is fair game no matter how guilty or innocent. One of the shockers in The Ring is the false conclusion where we find out that what we thought put the ghost at peace had no effect at all other than to solve the mystery of how the girl died.The demons are also very Eastern: not the ugly, leering Christian demons from hell but ones that are unsettling and watchful. More portents of distruction than bringers.I actually appreciated the restraint with CGI and gore after having seen Exorcist: The Beginning just the night before. Although the thinking behind films these days seems to be that the audience expects lots of gore and special effects (otherwise they won't pay to see the film), I think the over-the-top approach usually detracts from the story as was the case in Exorcist I (which had potential but ended up being an abortion of a movie).The non-linear approach to telling the story didn't bother me; in fact I enjoyed it because it sustained the mystery. In another inevitable comparison to The Ring, I think The Grudge, is far more satisfying it it's explaination for why the vengeful ghost and why the seemling indiscriminate selection of victims.One more plus, the DVD interviews with Sam Raimi and Takashi Shimizu were a lot more enlightening than the typical gushing sound bites you find on most DVDs. They seemed to have left the over the top superlatives to the American performers.The movie has some weaknesses which is why I gave it only three stars.First, the pacing seems glacial: there aren't many extreme emotional events for the first 30 minutes. Even events that seem like they should be disturbing, left me feeling ""why should I care?"" Because Sam Raimi (""Evil Dead"" and ""Spiderman"") isn't exactly the most understated of filmakers, I imagine the quietness and pacing of the film was a deliberate decision. For me, it didn't work.Second, the lead played by Sarah Michelle Geller, seemed to be not much more than a one-dimensional vehicle for keeping the story moving. If you're expecting Buffy kicking demon ass, you'll need to look at reruns or DVD compilations. Buffy is no where to be found in this movie.Bottom line: I recommend this movie IF you are open to the fact that it is a Japanese ghost story and with the exception of casting American actors, does little to Westernize the film. If you're expecting The Ring (the Westernized version) you'll be disapointed. ANSWERNOTFOUND",creepy and disturbing,"(459, 480)",2,0.9,True

I have to admit, when it first came out I was a kid, so I wrote it off as boring and didn't bother to watch.  In my teens I realized that I actually liked period drama's, and this movie quickly became a favorite of mine!The movie itself, as a period drama is first class!  Although it isn't completely faithful to the book, it is my favorite of the adaptations I've seen ('07, and '81).  The casting is superb (although 2 of the actors were a bit older than their book counterparts); and their acting leaps & bounds better than the '81!  The scenery, and stately homes are stunning!!  Also, the soundtrack fits the period, and compliments the storyline very well.Most likely, if the viewer hasn't read the book, the alterations, and missing characters shouldn't affect their opinion much._______**SPOILER ALERT**As for the (most notable) missing scenes/parts:- Willoughby's visit, and conversation with Elinor at Cleveland (during Marianne's sickness).  The movie tried to rectify it by way of Col. Brandon.  After his revealing Willoughby's seduction of his ward to Elinor, he proceeds to tell her he inquired, and has reason to believe that Willoughby's intentions were not entirely as dishonorable toward Marianne...It's not quite as satisfying as hearing it come from Willoughby himself though.- Edward's week stay, not long after they arrived (on his way back from visiting Lucy in Plymouth).  The book scene conveyed the troubled mind of Edward, and his internal conflicting feelings as regards Elinor, and Lucy.And provided a hint of what was to come, with the lock of hair seen by all in his ring (which he passed off as Fanny's, and the Dashwood sisters supposed he somehow obtained a lock of Elinor's without her knowing).- The dinner party with Mrs. Ferrars & Jennings, the Dashwood's, Steels', and Middleton's.

The film is notable for several reasons. Christopher Lee makes his first appearance as Dracula, his most famous role. Unlike Bela Lugosi's sense of tragic mystery, Lee stresses the vampire's delight in his unholy lusts. Lust is the key word. The late-Victorian era novel dealt only indirectly with sex. This movie has a definite erotic tone that is a Hammer tradition. For 1958, this was sexy stuff. Prim and proper women wantonly seek the vampire's kiss. The penetration is of the fangs in the neck variety, but we get the idea. Peter Cushing is Van Helsing, the vampire slayer. The brilliant casting of Cushing and Lee as adversaries became familiar fare in many subsequent horror flicks. The final battle between Dracula and Van Helsing in Dracula's castle is one of the great moments in vampire cinema. Lee's towering, menacing figure in the flowing black cape dominates the film. Lee's dialogue is minimal, but he projects more danger with icy stares than most actors accomplish with reams of discourse. When bloodlust rages, he is feral and overpowering. The characters are based on Bram Stoker's work, but the story unfolds in a way uniquely its own. One minor note: the obvious British accents of the supporting cast provokes unintended chuckles as they portray central European innkeepers and domestics. Little Tania is a special hoot. This is a great example of the way they used to make horror movies before the onslaught of insane killers stalking teenagers in a theater near you. Collectors building a library of Classic Horror 101 certainly need this one. ;-) ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1632, 1646)",1,0.0,False

It is unfocused and meanders for far too long. You can throw away about eight episodes a season because he does not know where he wants to go with them. He spends too much time fumbling around in the dark looking for a purpose or a plotline to follow and that is what happened with Firefly. The only difference is that he spends more time world building in this one instead of creating a purpose for the season.After seeing all of the episodes, well it does not live up to the hype. The characters are generic Whedon archetypes. It spends too much time with its being cutesy poo dialog, which is not witty or clever.

""Godzilla"" is the perfect example of when this fails to happen; in spite of spectacular special effects, the atrocious script made the movie ridiculous and largely unwatchable.  Thankfully, ""The Day After Tomorrow"" has avoided this pitfall.  By working in enough real science, the director/writers allow the viewer to accept an otherwise unbelievable premise, and enjoy a special effects extravaganza with a surprising amount of heart.That premise is that fresh water pouring of the melting polar ice caps have disrupted  the Gulf Stream, which is responsible for North America's and Northern Europe's mild climates, causing the rapid onset of an Ice Age.  As I alluded to above, this is actually a fairly accepted scientific theory, and while the timeframe is far too compressed to have any foundation in reality (ice ages take hundred or thousands of years to develop) this plausibility is sufficient to make the movie enjoyable.Which is a good thing as the special effects are spectacular, and include tornados tearing apart Los Angeles, British helicopters falling out of the sky frozen solid, and the coup de grace, New York City being inundated and flash frozen.  That said, all of these bells and whistles would be for naught if it weren't for a good story, and the actors deliver a solid, if not spectacular  tale.In the best tradition of the post-apocalyptic genre, the story wisely starts out globally, narrows to a national focus, and then continues to spiral down to a few key characters who can place the unimaginable in some sort of digestible context.  In this case, the viewer follows Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) who has predicted the consequences of polar melting, as he fights the way through the storm in an effort to rescue his son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) who is trapped in New York with several of his friends.  This personalization of a global calamity is highly effective, as it clearly represents the most basic consequences of the calamity and represents similar efforts that would be going on all over the world.  As a bonus, the film also toys with modern norms, as Americans flood over the border into Mexico, which adds an additional point of reference for this vastly altered world.The DVD itself is solid if not spectacular.  The sound and image are both superb, and fully convey the experience of cutting edge special effects.  The disc also includes the usual deleted scenes (only two, which while perhaps to be expected with a special effects thriller, was somewhat disappointing) and commentaries.  Again, these are the usual, and really represent what would be the minimum standard for DVD releases; as such, it wouldn't surprise me if we saw a special edition release down the road, so that's something to keep in mind.All in all, ""The Day After Tomorrow"" is an enjoyable movie featuring superb effects, and a surprisingly good story.  It will particularly appeal to fans of the post-apocalyptic genre, as it pays tribute to several core themes of the genre.  However, it is easily appreciated as a thriller, and has a surprising amount of hear as well.Jake Mohlman ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3271, 3285)",1,0.0,False

I certainly did, and I wouldn't consider myself a die-hard Marvel comic book fan. I enjoyed the derring-do and ironic humor that infused the comic book films preceding this one, but director/screenwriter Joss Whedon really whips together all the formula elements that madeIron Man(1 & 2),The Incredible Hulk(the 2008 version),Thor, andCaptain America: The First Avengerpurely entertaining into something that miraculously makes the larger-than-life dimensions of the superheroes more instantly relatable.  A top-notch cast certainly helps as does the armada of technicians who pull off the effects in all their 3-D, eye-popping glory, of course, but much of the credit really needs to go to Whedon for making this film as much fun as a comic book.Running a surprisingly fleet 143 minutes, the potentially convoluted plot allows Nick Fury, a character heretofore limited to tantalizing post-credits scenes in the previous movies, to take center stage. He's the surly one-eyed leader of S.H.I.E.L.D., the peacekeeping agency who must quickly recruit a team of superheroes to do battle with Loki, the deceitful half-brother of Thor, the Norse deity of thunder. Loki has brainwashed archer supreme Hawkeye and brilliant physicist Dr. Erik Selvig (already seen in ""Thor"") while stealing a cosmic cube called the Tesseract, a powerful energy source of seemingly limitless potential, from a remote research facility. Fury recruits Black Widow, a former Russian spy last seen in action in ""Iron Man 2"", to gather the troops including a highly reticent Bruce Banner a.k.a. the Hulk. Meanwhile, Iron Man, Captain America and Thor have to learn to get along before facing the enemy.Loki turns out to be the least of their problems as the Tesseract unleashes a powerful alien race known as the Chitauri, which leads to the inevitable battle royale on the devastated streets of Manhattan. While the state-of-the-art action scenes are everything you want them to be, it's really the film's unexpected sense of humor that consistently buoys the story. Realizing the escalating level of implausibility, Whedon smartly provides clever lines and scenes to everyone (and not just Robert Downey, Jr.)  For instance, after Thor proclaims Loki solemnly as his Asgardian brother, Black Widow points out that he killed eighty people in two days to which Thor points out Loki was adopted. Later, in the most crowd-pleasing scene, the Hulk grabs a character by his leg and whip-slams him into the floor like he's beating a dust rag. The defiance of logic and physics is par for the course here, and Whedon's kid-like attitude and deft hand make it all the more exhilarating.The physically fit cast work surprisingly well together as an ensemble. While Downey's scene-stealing as Iron Man is a given, Chris Evans' Captain America, Chris Hemsworth's Thor, Mark Ruffalo's digitally altered Hulk, Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, and Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye all get their moments to shine. As Loki, Tom Hiddleston effectively conveys the inferiority complex that drives his villain with slithery cunning, while Samuel L. Jackson and Clark Gregg take full advantage of expanded roles as Fury and Agent Coulson respectively. The mistake most filmmakers make in showing an Armageddon situation is applying too much soul-baring gravitas to the proceedings. That's definitely not Whedon's take as he never lets us forget that we are watching a comic book come to life. It's gratifying to watch a popcorn movie that actually lives up to the hype in all its commercial glory. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3772, 3786)",1,0.0,False

I was wrong.  To start off, the special effects were one of the best I have ever seen in my entire life.  Every scene was portrayed with color and vibrancy.  It even made the Hallelujah Mountains (floating mountains) seem legitimate.  Although the actors may not be exactly who you would have expected, they did a phenomenal job.  When you are watching the movie you truly believe that the actors are the character they play.  Each line was spoken with true feeling and emphasis.  One of the most remarkable things about the movie was the language.  The fact that the movie producers can create an entirely made up language and then have each actor memorize it is beyond me.On the surface it may seem that the storyline is pretty fantasized and has nothing to do with your life, but if you dig a little deeper you will realize that it is very relevant.  The movie brings up the idea of corporate greed.  The government wants to go to Pandora and harvest its riches.  When they get there they realize that an entire population is settled on the land, but they do not care.  All they want is the riches and therefore are willing to do anything to get it.  I think that, along with some fighting scenes, is the reason it is truthfully rated pg13.  Despite the great aspects, the fact that they name the ore that they cannot obtain ""unobtainium"" is pretty cheesy.  If you are going to create an entire dialogue for the Navi you can at least come up with a clever name for some ore.My favorite scene was towards the end when Neytiri fought Colonel Miles Quaritch.  This scene was very dramatic because Jake Sully was trapped unconscious and Neytiri had to get to him first otherwise he would die.  The blows went back and forth, Neytiri riding a vicious beast, and Colonel Miles Quaritch fighting inside a robot.  When Neytiri knocked Colonel Miles Quaritch's gun out of his hands he pulled out his knife and killed the beast.  It landed on top of Neytiri trapping her under his corpse.  This scene supports the theme of the movie which is trust.  Neytiri had to decide whether or not to accept Jake as one of the Navi and had to trust him.  The same went for Jake.  He needed to decide whether or not he should trust the marines or the Navi.  Overall, ""Avatar"" surpassed its expectations and `wowed' almost anyone who came to see it.

Unlike the morality tales of Pixar films (which I do love, that&#8217;s no insult on them!), Frozen goes a step back to a more traditional method of storytelling.  Like Sleeping Beauty or Snow White, Frozen takes us through a story of love, of betrayal, and of family.I&#8217;m sure sisters have felt shut out by their fellow siblings.  This film does reflect that.  It also tells us not to rush into anything, like marriage, as that person could really be a wolf in sheep&#8217;s clothing.The characters are developed well in this story of two sisters, Elsa (the young and feisty one) and Anna (the magic one, whose powers of ice and snow make her consider herself a freak with a curse).  Their ups & downs in relationships between each other, and the love they have for each other is quite a change from the usual boy-meets-girl-Prince Charming style of Disney films.The music is fresh and original.  The film plays like a musical and most of the themes deal with tackling life head-on and not be dissuaded from your goals and purposes.The story is inspired from Hans Christian Anderson&#8217;s tale of The Snow Queen.The theater version starts with a short, that plays like an old Walt Disney 1940s&#8217; style black & white cartoon, but then morphs into a modern story with plenty of slapstick.  Great start!I really liked the Snow Queen, who hurt her sister and did not want a repeat of that.  But thought protecting her by not revealing herself, she actually hurt her sister emotionally and the younger one was shut out.  I&#8217;m sure kids will relate to this.Bottom Line:  If you love castles, dancing, some comedy relief and some traditional Disney style, look no further than Frozen.

It isn't just drawing on the imagery or providing a parallel to the political situation [as you might find in Episode III or Batman Begins], I think this movie is a full-on processing of 9/11, in the only way you can currently make a movie about 9/11: using metaphor and indirection.Certain elements are directly parallel: from visuals of buildings collapsing, airplanes fallen from the sky, walls lined with ""missing"" posters, and especially the snowfall of ash and clothes that occurs during several scenes, to thematic elements, such as the question of whether it is preferable to seek revenge although it would mean more deaths, or simply to attempt to survive in the aftermath. There is talk about how an ""occupation never works,"" and Tom's son is doing a paper on the French occupation of Algeria. Later in the film, Tom has to try to convince his son not to join the Army, as it would be throwing his life away in a pointless war. Yep, you got 9/11, and it's right there on your movie screen.I happened to be on vacation the week of 9/11, returning five days after the attack, while the rubble was still burning. I didn't see the attack in person, but I saw the walls of ""missing"" posters, precisely as depicted in this film. You could literally feel the psychic tension increase the closer you came to downtown. Me and several of my friends reported suddenly bouts of crying happening at least once an hour. I worked in a building nearby that summer, and saw the pile of rubble from the towers that looked just like a big dump--until I saw a tiny person at the base of that pile, and realized that that pile of rubble was at least 10 stories high. I watched the attacks on television as they happened. The amazing thing was that they looked SO MUCH like special effects. I had no idea that the special effects I had been watching were so realistic! I had to turn off the TV after a very short time, because the more I watched it, the less real it became. One of the few moments that seemed real was when the second tower was collapsing, but the news commentator, possibly because of some technological delay, wasn't commenting on it yet.As I watched War of the Worlds, I kept thinking ""Why would someone, especially anyone who was in New York around 9/11, want to watch this?"" I think the answer comes in the form of one of Hitchcock's cardinal rules for creating suspense: that the audience should identify with the main characters--but not too much. He believed that it is crucial that the audience remain aware, on some level, that they are sitting safely in an auditorium watching a movie. The incredibly intense experience of watching imagery so familiar from the 9/11 while safely eating popcorn in an air-conditioned movie theater is powerfully cathartic. It allows us New Yorkers a way to process the terror and confusion we felt--from a safe distance.When I was a video clerk at a Borders Books and Music store, I remember looking at a video that included the famous footage of the Kennedy assassination. The copy on the back of the box said something to the effect of: ""Relive the horror of that terrible tragedy again and again!""I thought this movie was incredible. The sheer precision of the direction was amazing. As I was watching it, it occurred to me that Spielberg truly is heir to Hitchcock in terms of his skill at telling a story by purely visual means, the economy and efficiency of his shots and editing, and how he is able to make a story exciting almost entirely through technique. That this story involves the inclusion of several very complex effects only makes his technical achievement that much greater.Spielberg very cannily keeps his special effects--and these are the very best special effects money can buy--in the periphery of most shots, which very effectively ups their realism and the sense of their integration with the characters. For example, one shot shows Cruise looking up, while we see the approaching alien ship reflected in the windshield of the car next to him. Contrast this to something like The Day After Tomorrow, in which you have the special effects shots and the character reaction shots, which are usually two very separate things.Many reviewers have picked out the mysterious fact that the one car Tom picks out magically works, when all of the others don't. Upon seeing this movie again, I see that there is an explanation for this. That is the car that Tom suggested a way to fix to the mechanic, and presumably the mechanic fixed it while the first tripod was appearing. This also explains why Tom knew to go right to that particular car. It's almost charming that Spielberg thinks that most people will be paying attention to this, particularly when distracted by mass scale destruction! Nevertheless, this doesn't explain the miraculous way the car survives without a scratch when a jet airliner crashes and destroys and entire neighborhood.One of the sequences I have seen derided as being lugubrious or somewhat pointless is the scenes in which Tom and Dakota hole up in the basement with Tim Robbins. Sure, Tim may be getting a little comfortable in his nutso basement dweller routine, but I think that this section contains THE most critical content of the movie, and that is its critique of the way politics have played out in the post-9/11 world. Outraged that the aliens should DARE to attack humans [it's just not right!], Tim, with his single shotgun, is under the delusion that the humans can rise up and show these aliens a thing or two. He has no plan except for the righteousness of his desire to stand up. Tom has to stop him, as he knows that if Tim makes a sound, he [and Tom and his daughter] will be instantly killed. Not to mention that it wouldn't accomplish anything. I think this creates a fairly compelling parallel with the 9/11 attacks and the Iraq war... How many of us, if we could go back, wish we could choose not to pursue a course of senseless retaliation that has done nothing but destroy a country and kill more than 1,500 of our troops? At least the Tim character, in the movie, wants to retaliate against someone who actually attacked him.Many of my favorite critics have lauded the technique of this film, but ultimately decided that it is minor Spielberg. I disagree. I think this is major Spielberg in virtually every sense. If you buy into my 9/11 interpretation, it is an important film. It is certainly an emotionally powerful film and a technically masterful film. It has been quite a while since I have been so completely overwhelmed by a movie. In allowing viewers to reprocess the terror and confusion of 9/11 from the safety of their seats, and placing it within a context that can be thought about without the crazed emotional outbursts that prevent the real issues that arise from the attacks from being discussed, it's almost as though he has delivered us a nationwide therapy session.

Also, the idea that no one knows that all that high tech equipment Batman uses could only be produced by the richest man in town, also seems absurd. But as with almost all science fiction, we take it for what it is: glimpses of reality disguised in fantasy.It takes liberties from the original comic, but we don't really mind because it sets in a seemingly more realistic approach instead of relying on a vat of acid, for instance. Clearly, there is still a sense of whimsy without taking from the comic completely. Overall it is dark and grimacing, as it should be. This includes the headache waiting for you from the deep looming ""music"" that instills a sense of distress in the viewer. (a reason I wish I'd waited and seen it at home)Dark Knight raises deep morally rooted questions for which it gives some insight but lets you decide. It leads us through disconcerting circumstances that are no doubt amplified to shine a light to the very essence of our being. Through the darkness there is a morbid bit of comedy which goes right back to mimicking the balance that is an unavoidable part of reality. It plays with themes of balance, fate, fear, chaos, and desire. The way it was written toys with us so cleverly.The stunts are inconsequential in comparison with the performances and writing. However, the acting of Bale and Gyllenhaal make them seem as though they simply worked out okay for the movie but are not perfect. Bale doesn't show us the remorse or the loneliness when the time comes for him to do so.Is it worth seeing in the theater?

But the problem isn't with the movie itself, which is first-rate.  There were just too many people who had their own ideas of what the first new Star Wars film in nearly a generation should be like for creator George Lucas to possibly satisfy.  Sadly, those persons' negative reviews have somewhat marred an otherwise phenomenal blockbuster, which by any well-reasoned definition is a highly worthy extension of the beloved Star Wars mythos.Even the film's critics agree that this movie looks spectacular.  Lucas spared no expense in the set design and special effects, and the result is simply magical.  From the iconic architecture of the planet Naboo to the wastes of Tatooine and the cold reaches of space, everything shimmers with life and you almost feel like you could walk right into the story yourself. Beyond that, the story itself is excellent and in line with the familiar Star Wars formula of good vs. evil on an interplanetary scale.  Likewise, the cast is terrific and does a tremendous job.  Liam Neeson is an commanding Qui-Gon Jinn who dominates every scene he is in, and Ewan McGregor is also excellent as the young Obi-Wan Kenobi just growing into his full power but clearly destined to be one of the greatest Jedi of all.  Natalie Portman's Padme is appealing and believable, and Jake Lloyd is surprisingly effective as the ill-fated Anakin Skywalker.  Ian McDiarmid lends a sinister air as the shadowy Senator Palpatine, whose suave elegance barely conceals his true dark nature.Yes, there is Jar Jar Binks, and while Jar Jar does occasionally strike a funny note he is more often annoying.  And young Mr. Lloyd does have to utter some rather painful lines from time to time.  But these minor flaws hardly hinder the overall drama, which is quite strong.  Particularly moving is Anakin's final dialogue with his mother, when he stands at the crossroads of his destiny and realizes that once he chooses which path to take, he can never look back. Of course there is also the famous pod race, a deadly race against fate that shoots across the Tatooine desert like lightning. The masterful extended climax (divided amongst no less than four different battles)is incredibly exciting.  Here young Anakin foreshadows Luke Skywalker's later Death Star heroics, and Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan face the diabolical Darth Maul in an incredible display of lightsaber wizardry.No review of this film would be complete without mention of John Williams's usual fantastic score.  The soundtrack is magnificent, one of the most thrilling any movie has ever had, and it should've been used a bit more liberally in &quot;Attack of the Clones.&quot;Not only is the movie great, but the DVD is something special too.  There are tons of special features that are sure to enhance what should be an already awesome viewing experience.Overall, most of the negative press this movie got was undeserved.  The characters are strong, the action unceasing, and the final product is nothing less than sensational.  If it's not quite as good as the original Star Wars films, &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; nonetheless recaptures the spirit of those immortal movies and opens a brand new door to wonder and fantasy.

But it does - and does so very, very well. If Episodes I and II were the appetizers, Episode III is the main course and the desert for the Star Wars prequel trilogy.If you don't know, the Star Wars prequel trilogy was designed to be the story of a good man's decent into evil - eventually leading him to become one of cinemas most iconic villains: Darth Vader.  In Episodes I and II we see glimpses of this character as Anakin Skywalker fights off his inner anger and fear in the face of turmoil.  In Episode III, these feelings become even stronger because of the love he has for his secret wife, Padme, and his allegiance to Chancellor Palpatine.  As the Republic falls apart at the hands of Palpatine, so does Anakin.  It is truthfully painful to watch our hero's decent to the Dark Side of the Force, but the part is played magnificently by Hayden Christensen.Anakin is truly and thankfully the central character of this movie, but the other characters in the movie are pivotal as well. Ian McDiarmid (the aforementioned Chancellor Palpatine) delivers a wonderful, Oscar-worthy performace as Skywalker's ""friend"" who twists Anakin's mind and heart leading him to his eventual destruction.  Ewan McGregor also does an incredible job as Obi-Wan Kenobi, as he did in Episodes I and II, who plays a pivotal role in the movie as a protector of the galaxy and as Anakin's mentor, friend, and conscience.  The scenes between Anakin and his wife, Padme (played by Natalie Portman), are very good, heartbreaking, and touching.  Anakin discovers Padme is pregnant (with twins, unbeknownst to them - eventual Jedi Knight, Luke Skywalker, and Princess Leia) which makes it all the more difficult for them to continue this marriage in secrecy. Portman delivers a wonderful performance, although her screen time is limited compared to the previous two prequels.  Both of the droids, C3PO and R2-D2, are back as well, as well they should be.  They are as essential a part of the saga as anyone is and any scene that they are in is definitely enjoyable.  The supporting cast of Samuel L. Jackson as Mace Windu, Christopher Lee as Count Dooku/Darth Tyranus, and the voice acting of Frank Oz as Yoda are wonderful as well.Being the last of the Star Wars films and the movie that connects the prequel trilogy to the original one, anyone familiar with Star Wars can see the end in sight when watching Episode III.  As George Lucas has said, this movie has most of the plot that he had envisioned when he decided to go back and do a prequel trilogy - and the plot does shine.  This movie totally pulls you in from start to finish. From the awe-striking space battle, through the multiple incredible lightsaber and ground battles, through Anakin's heart-wrenching struggle to choose what is most important to him and all of the confusion that these choices cause, and to the heartwarming, yet tear-jerking end - this movie is absolutely incredible and one for the ages.If you are a Star Wars fan, or even if you have never really checked it out before - this is an incredible movie for all audiences.  It may be a little scary and violent for younger viewers (hence the series' first PG-13 rating), but all of these movies are incredibly clean with no objectional content whatsoever (other than what I would call ""mild"" violence with no blood or gore).  I would recommend seeing the others before seeing this one, but this movie can definitely stand alone as a truly great movie.  This is definitely a MUST SEE, in my opinion, and is a MUST BUY for anyone who has been on the incredible ride that Lucas started in 1977 with a little movie that no one thought would succeed called ""Star Wars"".

That movie was followed by the cliffhanger sequel ""The Empire Strikes Back"" (1980), and the third film in the series was ""Return of the Jedi"" (1983). After tinkering with the three movies a little, Lucas released new theatrical versions in 1997. Now, tweaked versions of the 1997 films have been released as a four-disc DVD set under the collective title ""Star Wars Trilogy,"" marking the first time any version of these three films has been available on DVD.The 1977 movie commonly known originally as simply ""Star Wars"" has been retitled ""Star Wars IV: A New Hope,"" and ""Star Wars V"" and ""Star Wars VI"" have been incorporated into the titles of ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Return of the Jedi,"" respectively. The retitling came about in connection with a trio of prequel films that began being released theatrically in 1999, and the numbering scheme indicates where each movie fits into the epic story's chronology.I've always found all three films in the Star Wars Trilogy to be great, and they form a unified whole. I wouldn't characterize them as science fiction I would describe them as pulpy space fantasy action adventure movies. They are set in some distant galaxy during a civil war, and we side with freedom-fighter rebels who are battling the evil Galactic Empire. I would say the ""Trilogy"" is an elaborate coming-of-age tale where we follow the maturation of an idealistic farm boy named Luke Skywalker.On his adventures, Luke teams up with daredevil smuggler Han Solo and plucky young Princess Leia, But Lucas has packed the ""Trilogy"" with a host of quirky characters, including a pair of delightful androids called C-3PO and R2-D2. And I think the movies' chief villain, Darth Vader is one of the most memorable in all of cinema.I've always found it intriguing that some inhabitants of the galaxy embrace the belief that there exists a mystical energy called the Force. There are certain beings called Jedi who seemingly derive special powers from the Force and use them to bring about good. To me, Alec Guinness gives an unforgettable performance as Obi-Wan Kenobi, a wise old Jedi who mentors Luke. Young Skywalker also receives training from another Jedi, the diminutive Yoda. But the Force is not automatically a source of good: it has a corrupting Dark Side that can result in evil.Each movie in the Trilogy is contained on its own single sided disc, and as far as I am concerned, the three feature films all look and sound terrific: the colors are vivid, the picture is sharp, and the sound is clean. The DVDs provide feature-length audio commentary tracks for all three movies. George Lucas, actress Carrie Fisher, sound designer Ben Burtt, and visual effects expert Dennis Muren are heard on all three tracks, and these four commentators are joined by a fifth, director Irvin Kershner, on ""The Empire Strikes Back."" I found all three commentary tracks worthwhile, and I particularly enjoyed listening to Lucas and Kershner. Burtt gives more details about the sound than I really want to know.

The dream sequences, the characters, and especially Freddy Krueger make them all enjoyable in their own way.  These movies are especially interesting because they don't consist of the same kind of usual killer.  Sure, there is Michael, Leatherface, and Jason, but who cares?  There are all the same.  Freddy is totally different.  He instead kills people in their dreams, which make for an intriguing storyline.  I never exactly admired Freddy Krueger.  I'll admit I was into Michael and Jason, but Freddy has more style.The first one comes off just right.  The whole plot made sense and made it scary to know that are dreams could be reality.  The later installments do not live up to the first, but some are very good and are directed by Renny Harlin (one of my favorite directors!), Rachel Talalay, and, of course, Wes Craven.  Everyone of these deserves a watch.A Nightmare On Elm Street (1984) - The best one out of them all.  This one is where it all began and so did Johnny Depp's career.  Heather Langenkamp is great as Nancy.  Robert Englund was outstanding (and would be for the next 6 installments) as Fred Krueger, the dream stalker.  This has a good, creepy mood to it.  (10/10)  Rated R for strong violence/gore, language, and partial nudity.  ""I'm your boyfriend now, Nancy!""A Nightmare On Elm Street 2 (1985) - This one was a bit weird.  First off, it forgot the idea of Freddy (Englund) being in your dreams and made him become a real person in life.  He begins to take over Jessie's (Mark Patton) body and starts killing people again.  Second, it didn't explain its characters that well.  It wasn't that scary, but it was entertaining.  Mark Patton wasn't that great.  He mostly just screamed like a girl the whole movie and wore dorky clothing.  (6/10)  Rated R for strong violence/gore, brief nudity, and some language.

There are teens at a psychiatric ward that are suffering from bad dreams about Fred Krueger (Englund, who is very creepy in this one).  Anyway, the kids start to die one by one.  They find out that they have special powers in their dreams and that they can maybe defeat Freddy for good.  The movie was good, but I didn't need to see that one kid turn into a wizard (a bit corny!).  There are some really cool scenes in this one.  (7/10)  Rated R for strong violence/gore, nudity, sexual situations, and language.  ""Your big break in T.V.!""A Nightmare On Elm Street 4 (1988) - This is one of my personal favorites.  This one had everything from cool dream sequences to great characters, to vivid colors, and many more.  Too bad that they killed off the remaining Dream Warriors.  I felt really bad when Joey Crusel died off.  Anyway, the new characters are just as great, especially Lisa Wilcox as Alice.  Danny Hassel is also great as Dan.  This is one that you need to see.  (8/10)  Rated R for strong violence/gore, nudity, and language.  ""How's this for a wet dream?!""A Nightmare On Elm Street 5 (1989) - My least favorite one.  It turned away from the colorful Part 4 and turned into a gothic and disgusting movie.  Lisa Wilcox returns and so does Danny Hassel.  He dies into the movie fairly quickly though.  Then were left with one-dimensional characters.  It was a pretty stupid plot and movie.  Alice (Wilcox) has an unborn child and it is killing her friends by letting Freddy get into its mind.  Don't bother!  (4/10)  Rated R for graphic sequences of violence, gore, and some language.  ""Put the pedal to the medal, Dan!""Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare (1991) - This also one of my favorites.  It is not a great movie, but it is very entertaining.  There is a great soundtrack also.  Freddy (Englund) is more goofy in this one.  It's pretty funny though.  The dream sequences are pretty nifty and there isn't a lot of gore (which is good).  A young Breckin Meyer plays a stoner, Spencer, and he's pretty funny.  The plot is about 4 teenagers and their psychiatric helper that go to Springwood, where all the children have died from Freddy.  Freddy begins to kill them off, but there is a link between Freddy and one of the 5 people.  This also sets up some back round on who Freddy is.  This movie is just for a good time.  You can also watch the ending in 3-D if you have the box set.  This is a movie you have to see.  (7/10)  Rated R for violence/light gore, language, drug use, and human abuse.  ""Hey Spence, let's trip out!""Wes Craven's New Nightmare (1994) - Heather Langenkamp, John Saxon, Nick Corri, Wes Craven, and others play themselves in this movie.  There is another ""Nightmare"" sequel coming into production.  Heather (herself) is going to play Nancy.  Yet, as the movie we are watching progresses, the script is being made the way we watch it.  So, in the end, everything in the movie was made into the script.  Soon, people start dying on the set and Heather's son (Miko Hughes) begins to act like Freddy.  Heather decides to take on the role of Nancy once more and take Freddy down for good.  Okay, this movie is really confusing.  I never knew if I was watching a movie, a dream, or a movie inside a movie.  Freddy is rarely seen, which is a good thing.  His make-up isn't that good in this one.  It looks like melted rubber and it doesn't go well.  I also thought this was the one where Freddy became scary again.  I really didn't think so.  It came off as a bit of a disappointment in the end.  (6/10)  Rated R for strong violence/gore, and language.  ""Come here, my piggy.  I got some gingerbread for you!""The Nightmare Encyclopedia - This is a great disc for all the information about the Nightmare On Elm Street series.  There are three things to choose from on the menu: PRIMETIME, INDEX, and LABYRINTH.

I mean, blurting out some dialogue, or reciting it as if you're making an emotionless statement, that's not acting.  Seriously, this is what I expect from fifth graders appearing in their very first school play.  It's just astonishes me every time one of the characters says something.  It's like a big, dumb, obvious summary of what's going on at the moment.  ""Mom, I'm not a slave any more!""  Mom:  ""All your dreams have come true.""  Said with all the emotion of ""Oh, you remembered to pick up the potato chips from the store.""  Probably 80% of the dialogue in this movie is like this.  Most first-time script readthroughs on a soap opera must be far superior to this.  Seriously, Scooby Doo has  better acting - much, much better.  I honestly can't remember ever seeing anything like this, except maybe in the worst of the worst of Sci-Fi Originals.  And even then, it's not every member of the entire cast like it is here.Then of course there's Jar Jar, the baby talking donkey.  I guess Lucas was really reaching out for the 2 and under audience.  And the big battle at the end, with a villain we hardly know, so there's really no drama there (except what can be created with CGI), and he looks downright silly in that Halloween face paint.  Oh, let's not forget the story, as Annakin's fighter gets hit, causing him to go out of control.  He ACCIDENTALLY flies into the space station, then while shooting at some droids, ACCIDENTALLY hits the main reactor, which nicely waits for him to get to a safe distance before exploding.  Good grief, it's too stupid and pathetic to even bother criticizing.Overall, this is an astonishingly bad movie, with dialogue that keeps one in a constant state of ""What the **** did I just see?"".  I mean, constantly,. throughout the whole film.  The action is much the same, dumb, silly, dopey.  the tone of the movie goes from ""epic drama"" to dopey silliness, back and forth, pretty much every thirty seconds.  Dopey droids are vwooshed in half by the increasingly boring sounds of light sabers, which now look more like a fluorescent tube than any sort of weapon.  And then they chop another two dozen in half, then another three dozen, then another dozen.  Then another two dozen.

Prometheus is a prequel of sorts detailing events that may have set the story of Alien in motion and created it's iconic creatures. So why at the climax are we so unsatisfied by what we just saw? As with all Scott's films Prometheus is a gorgeously designed and filmed movie but, despite the interesting set up about the possible origins of man and the existence of other superior beings, the visuals are a just an empty candy coating as the film goes nowhere with these ideas. We get a story about Dr. Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Repace) who discovers numerous occurances of a hieroglyphic throughout various earth times and cultures which she interprets as an invitation from a extraterrestrial race. Enter the Weyland Corporation (The villainous ""Company"" from the Alien films) who fund an expedition but, apparently with there own agenda. And the Prometheus is off to investigate with it's cliche' corporate villain captain (Charlize Theron, who really doesn't do much but be a company bitch) and the usual suspicious android, David (Michael Fassbender who has the best role). And here lies the problem, we start out expecting to find something fascinating and Damon Lindelof and Jon Spaihts' script gives us a cliche' story of extraterrestrials whose intentions aren't as noble as first believed and slimy corporate villains who want to use what they find for there own nefarious purposes. Sorry, been there, done that. Seen it all before. The beings true purpose in their genetic tampering is never revealed nor does it make sense to leave evidence of their existence on earth when they are ultimately up to no good. Prometheus leaves the most interesting questions unanswered and instead moves the plot along by having characters do the stupidest things... seriously, genius scientists taking their helmets off in an alien environment without any clue that there might be an undetected threat?... Are you kidding me?... I'll admit there are a few tense scenes, althought the film is rather laid back pace wise, and could have used a lot more suspense and energy if it wasn't going to get overly interesting with it' story. And most aggrevating of all, is that the film is open ended. It doesn't even give us a satisfying conclusion. It leaves the most important questions unanswered and implies we have to wait for yet another film to find out how this story ends and how it links to the begining of Alien, which it eventually will.

Jon Favreau, the brilliant writer of Swingers, clearly has as much fun with the character as Sam Raimi has with Spiderman, and Tony Stark is very well fleshed-out and real.  Comparisons would abound with Batman - both were born rich, have reputations as playboys, lost their parents, head giant corporations, have no super powers of their own but are good at stocking up on useful gadgets -  but this film is better than any of the Batman flicks for my money (keeping in mind I haven't seen the latest one).  Great background story of how Stark became Iron Man, and also a fantastic technology sequence where Stark is perfecting his machine.  The battle at the end is not bad, although not as cool as the fight scenes in Matrix 2, and the movie has the best ending/closing line of any movie in recent memory.

While I didn't mind the extra time devoted to character development in the beginning, judging from many of the other reviews it's obviously too long for some viewers. Director Peter Jackson may be accused by some as the king of bloat, endlessly padding his movies with superfluous action scenes that don't really move the story along and Kong is no exception. The most obvious example for me is the dinosaur stampede scene. Jack Black and crew run under a herd of brachiosaurs while being simultaneously hunted by velociraptors. Well, a little or a lot of belief suspension is needed depending on your point of view and it is action for action's sake. But this is a fantasy movie, an escapist diversion designed to entertain, which it does quite well. This isn't Citizen Kane and it isn't ment to be. It's not meant to conform to reallity. Let's face it, if Kong were real, every time he moved the weight of his body would snap his arms and spine like twigs. But for the most part the action is outstanding, especially Kong's battle with three tyranosaurs and the scenery and sets are wonderful.But where PJ succeeds is not in the over the top choreographed action sequences, but in the emotional resonance he brings to Kong. He was able to make a CGI monkey not only believable, but a powerful character in his own right. He's not just a monster. Kong is portrayed as an embattled warrior/king whose scared body belies his ultimate loneliness. He is the last of his kind and his human-like pathos is amazing and palpable. Andy Serkis the actor who also played Gollum in the Lord Of The Rings was the model for King Kong and it is his facial expressions that were used as the basis for Kong. He really should win some sort of award for ""best digital actor"" or whatever you would call it as it is a new category marvelously pioneered by he, PJ and the effects folks. Kong is ultimately destroyed by his love for Ann Darrow portrayed by Naomi Watts and it is this relationship, his love and her sympathy and empathy for this lonely king that makes this movie so compelling. Kong is a tragic and sympathetic figure. The  moment he dies you can see the light go out of his eyes, a remarkable bit of CGI wizardry and it is truly sad. As Jack Black says at the end of the movie with dialog lifted verbatim from the original, ""twas beauty killed the beast.""As far as the DVD is concerned Peter Jackson and company have once again outdone themselves in the extra features department.

So, I do not plan to address those to ad nauseum, suffice to say I think the movies were perfect the way they were originally released in 1977, 1980 and 1983 respectively.I was one of the generation of young movie-goers who, after learning of this movie on the school playground, persuaded my mother shortly after my sixth birthday to drive 65 miles to see the movie at a small Scottish movie theater,I am assuming that people are familiar with the storylines of these three movies that chronicle the journey of farmboy Luke Skywalker from a remote desert planet to interplanetary hero and rising Jedi master.Regardless how you feel about the movies as they exist today, you cannot help but admit that this is an impressive set. After years of sitting on the fence over the format and drawing fire from the early adopters of DVD like myself, George Lucas has dived into putting out his movies on the digital format with a great deal of enthusiasm. The year before had seen the Indiana Jones trilogy finally finding its way onto DVD to much acclaim and here Lucas uses much the same formula (3 discs for the movies plus a bonus disc of special features) in his release of the original STAR WARS pictures.  Comprised in this set is (the retitled) A NEW HOPE (1977), THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (1980) and RETURN OF THE JEDI (1983).However, whereas the Indiana Jones set featured no film makers audio commentaries (Director Steven Spielberg apparently disapproves of the practice), here we have three very interesting audio commentaries. Appearing on all three tracks are George Lucas as producer (and director of A NEW HOPE), Sound Designer Ben Burtt, Special Effects wizard Dennis Muren and actress Carrie (Princess Leia) Fisher. Also joining the team for THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is the director of that movie Irvin Kirshner (the director of the third movie Richard Marquand sadly passed away years ago).Burtt provides some of the most interesting facts or the tracks, who knew that sound effects could be so fascinating?! It's really interesting to learn some of the most amazing things and places that Burtt used to come up with the sounds of the franchise. If you've ever wondered what was used to come up with the sounds of laser fire or the burps and beeps that R2-D2 uses then you will find the answer among these commentaries.But, in my opinion the best and most thoroughly entertaining commentary is provided for THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. Kershner is a very engaging and fascinating speaker and he relates a number of anecdotal information surrounding the goings-on around the set. He even mentions how he would get so taken by the Yoda puppet that he would catch himself giving direction to the puppet rather than Frank Oz and his team of puppeteers below the stage. Kirsh (as he affectionately known) also recounts the rigors the rigors of filming the Hoth scenes in Norway. He talks about the filming of the scene of Luke stumbling towards the camera (where he sees the image of Ben), with Kersh and crew warm and comfortable shooting from the entranceway of the hotel as actor Hamill was freezing outside.Sadly Fisher is the least talkative of all the participants which leads the commentaries to be top-heavy in technical details.As Indiana Jones had a three hour documentary on the making of those movies, so to does the STAR WARS trilogy. Named ""Empire of Dreams"" and shown in a heavily edited form on US television just prior to the DVD release, the documentary is incredibly detailed on all aspects of production.Knowing how popular and successful we now know STAR WARS was, its interesting to see how skeptical some at the studio (and on the crew) were regarding the viability of the movie. It is noted that the presence of the highly respected Alec Guinness on the set helped the (largely British) crew take the movie more seriously.  What is gratifying is also the reaction to the rough cut of the movie to the Fox board, we learn that one of the executives cried at the screening and rushed home to tell his family about the amazing movie.Perhaps most interesting visually is the screen tests for some of those who tried out for the roles including Kurt Russell trying out for the Han Solo role. Funnily in a modern-day (circa 2004) on-camera interview Mark Hamill is still able to recount his lines from his 1976 screen test.Rounding out the set are a selection of smaller featurettes and trailers. Taken altogether this set is well worth the wait, There are various rumors circulating however that Lucas plans to redo the movies again, this time in 3-D but until the next editions this set will be a valued part of any DVD collection.

How could a film with great-looking villains, amazing special effects, and Peter turning to the dark side, be bad? Well, for one thing, as great as the villains and special effects looked, they lacked heart and soul. As for Peter becoming more hostile and evil, the filmmakers decided to make a joke out of it and the whole storyline lost its punch. Also, by adding more, useless Peter Parker/Mary Jane Watson/Harry Osborn drama, the story became bloated, routine, and at times, boring. ""Spider-Man 3"" was the weakest of the trilogy.After finally watching the film for a second time, I found the film slightly more tolerable(mainly because I knew what I was in for). It still contained the same problems though. First, the storyline is filled with too many stories that are connected in totally unbelievable ways. Second, even though the audience has been close with the characters the last two films, Peter Parker, M.J. Watson, and others seem very one-dimensional here. Finally, when the film should have been serious, it opted for a more funny tone (which, ironically, I found not funny at all). Even though I have my complaints about the film, there are many parts that I did enjoy, mainly the special effects and fight scenes, James Franco's and Thomas Haden Church's performances, and in my opinion, the greatest scene of the trilogy, the creation of Sandman. These aspects elevate the film from being a waste of time.Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is loving life. He has the love of his life, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), he's doing well in school, and most importantly, his alter-ego, Spider-Man is finally being revered for all his hard work. Regardless of all the good things happening to him, there is still a lot he needs to deal with.First, his best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco), knows he is Spider-Man and still places the death of his father in the web-slinger's hands. Harry eventually dons a new version of the Goblin suit, hoping to get revenge.Second, Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), the actual killer of Peter's loving uncle, escapes prison and ends up falling into a science experiment that turns him into the Sandman.Third, M.J. begins to move away from Peter to Harry. After her show does poorly and she's fired from the role, she begins to dislike Peter because of the success he is receiving as Spider-Man. When M.J. turns to Harry, Harry decides to use to his advantage to make Peter miserable.Four, an alien symbiote lands on Earth and similar to a parasite, uses Peter's suit as a host. When he dons his new black suit, he becomes more powerful, but at the same time, more aggressive and volatile. Once he finally gets rid of the symbiote, it finds a new host: Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), who becomes supervillain, Venom.Five...Six...Seven...Eight...The script is a mess. Besides what I mentioned above, there are many other stories in the film that deal with both Peter and Spider-Man. The main issue I have with the script is that it consists of coincidences. It's a coincidence that Spider-Man is fighting the villain, Sandman, who also happened to kill Peter Parker's uncle. It's a coincidence that the alien symbiote from space landed ten feet away from Peter instead of somewhere else on the planet. It's a coincidence that when Spider-Man rips himself free of the symbiote, his rival at the Daily Bugle, Eddie Brock, is right below him in some random church and then becomes Venom. Once he's Venom, it's a coincidence he knows that M.J. is Peter's love interest even though he's never seen her or the two together before. ""Spider-Man 3"" is ridded with all these situations that are unbelievable in terms of story and make the film much longer than needed.Maybe I'm being a tad harsh. After all, the film is based off a comic book. Yet, this doesn't excuse the poorly written characters. The audience has already learned and cared a lot about Peter Parker and M.J, but the third film does nothing new with them. Even though they are together, they are still having tough times to work things out, which I find quite annoying. At the end of ""Spider-Man 2,"" M.J. knew what she was getting into by being with Peter and how he wouldn't always be around for her physically. In this film, she pouts and whines, because Peter is never there for her, making the ending to the great ""Spider-Man 2"" look pointless. I wished that in this chapter they would have just been a happy couple and had M.J. more in the background of the story.In a superhero film, the villains are usually the most interesting and the fun part of the film is when our hero fights them. The problem with ""Spider-Man 3"" is that the villains are similar to their characters on a comic book page: flat. As cool as both of the main villains are, they lack any depth or real characterization. All the audience knows about Sandman is that he killed Uncle Ben and now he searches for money to help his daughter get better from some sickness. That's it. The most hurtful part of the film is that the coolest villain in the Spider-man universe, Venom, gets reduced to fifteen minutes of screen time. What's even worse is that he doesn't have a long tongue or a muscular body frame like the comics, but instead looks like black Spider-Man with a mouth like a raptor and a face that changes from the raptor mouth to Eric Foreman's face...I mean, Eddie Brock's face. Venom is just there. There's no real purpose for him to be in the story. If I had had my way, I would have let the ending of this one be Brock changing into Venom. That way, Sandman would have more time to develop as a character and then Venom could have his own film with Spider-Man. By throwing too many villains into the pot, the film suffers.My final problem with the film is the humor placed throughout. In the first two ""Spider-Man"" films, I laughed with the film when intentional, but in ""Spider-Man 3,"" I found myself laughing at what was happening on screen. Peter's transformation to the dark side is what I'm referring to. What should have been a serious moment in the film becomes incredibly stupid. For instance, when he walks down the street, he breaks out into dance and ""Saturday Night Fever"" type moves. It's really embarrassing. As I watched that scene, I cringed, wanting it to be over as fast as I could, but it goes on for a good five minutes unfortunately. Other ""funny"" moments throughout take the viewer out of the film, especially at the moments when the viewer is supposed to be most engaged in what's going on.Now, I can finally get on to what I did like about the film. First, the special effects are dazzling. If anything has improved throughout all the films, it's the effects. Sure, Spider-Man is still a computer's creation when slinging around New York, but he felt much more believable this time around. Second, the action scenes are well-done and plentiful. None are overlong (even though, Venom's should have been), but they are well shot and edited, especially the Sandman and Spider-Man fight in the underground. Third, the performances by James Franco and Thomas Haden Church are top-notch. While the film suffers from bad writing, these two are the only actors that truly make the most of it. Franco brings a much-needed warmth and charm to the film and his character stands out the most. Even though Sandman isn't a well-developed character, Church really makes the most out of it, which brings me to the best part of the film: the creation of Sandman.Watching grains of sand slowly come together to form Flint Marko is a spectacle. Even though it's totally unrealistic, the special effects team along with the help of Thomas Haden Church, make the scene believable. As Marko tries to form, he stumbles and chunks of sand fall away. Once he realizes what he's becomes, his face of sand changes expressions and with the aid of Christopher Young's score, the scene is just beautiful and breath-taking. It's my favorite scene in the entire trilogy. If the film had more scenes that had great special effects balanced with heart, then it would have been amazing.Overall, ""Spider-Man 3"" is the weakest of the trilogy. It was the one I was looking forward to the most, but was let down due to the script, characters, and the humor.

HALLOWEEN. NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. The list is lengthy. Some of them introduce new characters that send goose bumps up our backs. Others tread over old material and put a fresh spin on them. But THE DESCENT doesn't do any of that.Comically labeled as ""Six Chicks With Picks,"" this cave exploration thriller has the obligatory fright scenes (you know the kind ...where something weird suddenly and loudly burst toward screen), the attractive die-off cast, and themes trodden over time and again (from ALIENS to the horrible film THE CAVE.)For some reason this flick has gotten several positive reviews by professional film critics, but I fail to see why. There's nothing original. Nothing that lingers after watching it. No truly memorable cast members.That we're supposed to sympathize with Sarah (Shauna Mcdonald), the main character, is rammed down our throats (and through her husband's head) when a car accident takes Sarah's family from her. A year later, a group of girlfriends get together to go spelunking and to try and heal the wounds left by the death of Sarah's husband and child. There's a touch of deceit going on as Juno (Natalie Jackson Mendoza) was obviously having an affair with Sarah's husband before the accident. Whether Sarah knows of this or not is up for interpretation.As the group of six descend into the cave we quickly learn that this is an unexplored hole. And when a cave-in happens, they're forced to find another way out. But with them in the caverns is something pale and insidious (think about the Morlocks from THE TIME MACHINE and you won't be far off). But are they really there? Is it possible that Sarah's had a meltdown and only imagined seeing these creatures?It isn't the question of Sarah's sanity that'll put you off The Descent, but rather the ho-hum attitude most will have after seeing the film. It just doesn't have any emotional impact. You don't care whether these gals live or get their stomachs ripped open.The filming is also very dark and it's often difficult to see what exactly is going on. Although caves are dark and difficult to see in, this doesn't necessarily translate well to an entertaining movie experience.Still, those with a fear of enclosed spaces will probably be pretty freaked out by The Descent. The claustrophobia is easily felt, and when you add to that some bizarre ghost-like creatures with Spiderman-like crawling abilities, some might find this a lightly entertaining creep-fest.

Hearing nothing but negative remarks about this film, I never saw it until a friend offered the DVD for a free look. With nothing to lose, and being familiar with the story having seen the 1953 movie several times, I put it on.Wow, I enjoyed it; the film was very entertaining. The only annoying thing to me was the bratty teenage boy, who needed some discipline and never got it. Other than him, and his little sister who I put with only because it's Dakota Fanning, the film served its purpose beautifully, namely to 'shock and awe.'That it did......in spades!The Martian tripods were awesome, particularly in the long scene when they first appear out of the ground. To really appreciate this film, you have to have a surround system because the sound is fantastic. In fact, earlier with the ""lightning strikes,"" the sound gets attention in a big-way. In other words, special- effects-wise, it isn't just about visuals but the audio as well.Although the story of the father (Tom Cruise) and his two estranged (is anyone pictured married in films nowadays?) kids is so-so at best - and, as menntioned, really annoying at times - the film is all about the action. Some of those Martian scenes were jaw-dropping good and make this DVD worth a look. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1282, 1296)",1,0.0,False

However, Tarantino's style and writing along with a superb performance by Uma Thurman elevate this movie to greatness. There is never a dull moment and the viewer cheers for the Bride, despite the fact she's also an assassin who's out to kill people. Part of that is due to her reason for revenge, and part is due to Tarantino's style which actually makes the movie ""fun"" in a way.By now I think most people are prepared for the amount of violence in Tarantino's films. In this movie he takes advantage of the freedom in an anime-type sequence to have even more blood. The violence in ""Kill Bill Vol. 1"" is over-the-top to the point where it's humorous at times.The performances by all the actors are very good, especially Thurman. While there is plenty of action, there are also a good number of dramatic scenes and it does include some humor. I particularly enjoyed a series of scenes where the Bride was visiting Japan to obtain a special samurai sword which demonstrated a sense of honor. And there was a scene with Lucy Lui's character - also an assassin - in a board room meeting which was hilarious! Overall, I think it's a great action movie and is one of Tarantino's best.

The widescreen version originally had a problem with the last two movies, and I wouldn't get that until I knew for sure it was fixed.  Besides, since these are movies kids will appreciate most, the full screen versions tend to be what kids like (even though I always prefer widescreen).What I discovered is that my younger children did not know these movies.  I wondered if there being twenty years old would keep them from enjoying them.  I shouldn't have worried.  They enjoyed them immensely.  There were some cultural references that they did not get until I explained them (more from the 50s than the 80s), but that helped them gain some perspective on how culture changes over time.Unlike ""The Lord of the Rings"", this was never meant to be series of movies.  However, the huge global success of the first film led to the other two.  One evidence that a sequel was never planned is discussed in one of the extras.  It was pointed out that if they were setting up a sequel in the last scene of the first film, they would not have brought Marty's girlfriend in the car.  Having her there created tremendous problems in the second film, as you know if you have seen that film.The first film was inspired by the notion of a teenager discovering that his parents were once his age.  The time travel is the means to make that discover happen.  While the danger of changing the future is always there, it doesn't always have to be for the worse.  It sets up some very interesting notions about time travel, but it isn't really a movie about that or special effects.  It is about growing up in whatever time one lives and finding a deeper connection with one's parents and their lives.The second film begins in the future (building on the ending of the first film).  Because of something Marty was thinking about doing there and Biff acts on, the whole of history is changed again, and this time for the worse.  Doc Brown and Marty have to go back and prevent that change from occurring.  This leads to some very complex plotting because we have Marty's parents living their lives, Marty from the first film doing his thing, and now Marty from the second film coming back there to try and undo what Biff from the future has set in motion.  We learn from the extras about how hard these shots were to accomplish using the new Vistaglide from ILM.  Nowadays, it would be easy in digital, but unavailable in 1988.The third film was shot while the second film was in editing.  Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) is the romantic lead in this film!  It is set in the old west.  At the end of the second film the flying time machine is struck by lightening and disappears.  Moments afterward a car drives up from Western Union delivering a letter they had on file for seventy years.  Brown explains to Marty that he is happy in the past and to not come for him, but tells him how he can get home to his time in 1985.  But Marty learns that Brown was murdered shortly after the letter was written and is determined to go back and get him.The problem is how to get from 1885 to 1995 without any gasoline to get the car up to 88 mph and how to get there before Doc is killed.  Do they make it?The extras are interesting and useful in understanding the making of the films.  There is commentary that you can listen to for all three films as well as short documentaries, some deleted scenes, and a few outtakes.Buying the movies as a trilogy this way is quite affordable and the extras make it an even better buy.Recommended!  However, beware that in the mid 1980s that most of the successful teen films were ""R"" rated, so the studios made sure there was some swearing (mostly the SH-word) to make it a bit more ""mature"".  It kind of sounds out of place today - which would likely have WORSE language.  These films are rated ""PG"" and that seems right. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3875, 3889)",1,0.0,False
