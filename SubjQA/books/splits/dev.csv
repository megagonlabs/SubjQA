Nick, the quintessential weenie, appears oddly unaffected, even evasive and as the evidence mounts it becomes clear that his beautiful wife has meet with foul play and the allegedly loving husband is the prime suspect. Gone Girl creates a compelling peek into the lives of two co-dependent individuals one of whom is the worst kind of psycho.  Gone Girl provides an interesting perspective on media coverage, police procedure and the effect of personality in criminal cases.The design of the novel, alternating chapters from Nick's point of view with Amy's diary, is engaging and creates a page turning reading experience.  I eventually found, however, that the diary began reading like a Seinfeld script and was tempted to skip the later entries. The plot is intricate, and detailed, two attributes I enjoy and look for in a good thriller.  My disappointment arrived long before the conclusion when the plot resolved- on page 370 and an epilogue of sorts ended this four hundred twelve page novel with an unsatisfying metallic clunk.The writing is fast paced, witty and engaging.  The psychological elements are beyond insightful and become frighteningly real but the police procedural aspects are lacking which becomes a distraction.  The plot, to a point, is brilliant but for this reader it becomes the fatal flaw of Gone Girl. Two stars is very forgiving. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1596, 1610)",1,0.0,False

The story is certainly original. I admit I bought it for the vaguely sci-fi assumption from which it begins to discover that it was more like a romance novel with a literary fiction ending.The way it is written, mixing past, present and future, the narrative technique of the double point of view and the perfectly intertwined mechanism of time travels is definitely remarkable. As well the ability of Niffenegger's prose deserves praise as to capture the reader and make them empathize with the story. She could really make me live the story of Clare and Henry, but especially that of Henry, much more interesting than his wife.Bad, though, for the unnecessarily downhill final part, characterized by a continuous basking in the pain of the male protagonist. I found it sadistic towards the character itself and the readers. From the moment I knew how it would end, around page 300 (but I had a suspicion long before), I almost had no reason to go on. I continued to hope for a twist, because it seemed absurd that in a novel like that the ending would be so obvious so far in advance. But I was disappointed. The last scene is really disturbing. I read in an interview that Niffenegger has written that scene at very first, which is even more disappointing.What can I say? It certainly enriched me in many aspects of the way in which it was written, but I do not know if it was worth reading, given the prolonged bad mood that got me in the end.

Told from three different points of view, this story probes the intimate thoughts about what it's like for the maids of wealthy and middle class white people in Jackson, Mississippi. It's more than just hard, hard work; it's trying to survive in a constantly demeaning, life or death survival environment! That may sound trite, but trust this reviewer - these accounts are absolutely riveting, heart-stopping and poignant in ways that put new definitions on these commonly used terms!A young woman, Miss Skeetter, wants to be a journalist while her family and friends believe that finding a husband is all that matters, no matter what one's educational background is. Her first question that opens the central plot is to ask if one of the maids, Aibleen, wishes things were different.Aibleen never gets to complete the conversation, but she remembers the comment as she continues to care for three-year-old Mae Mobley. Aibleen, like other hired ""help,"" is more of a mother to Mae Mobley than her own distant, punishing mother by birth. The pain Aibleen feels over this coldness is stunning when one learns the numbing background of her own deep loss. Yet through it all, Aibleen's quietly muttered thoughts and written prayers to God make the reader roar with laughter and ponder what's important in the schemes and nonsense of daily family life. It is she who provides the impetus for Miss Skeeter's project, to get a few black women to talk about the joys, sorrows, challenges and downright insanity of their service employment.Then you'll meet Minnie, another maid who doesn't keep jobs too long because of her outspoken, funny, but offensively blunt comments to her employers. When that doesn't work, lies will do to get rid of her since she obviously doesn't know her ""place"" in this cold, tough world! Her challenges include a violent home life and an employer who is from the seedier side of Southern life, what used to be called ""white trash."" Miss Celia is lonely and constantly striving to fit in, but it's clear she doesn't have a clue about much!The project begins on a wrong note and seems doomed to die before it gets going, but tragedy will change all that. Then the reader will be just as stunned at the gritty, fiercely determined nature that arises in a dozen women to tell their tale despite what just might be brutally lethal results. They express their fury and their hysterical barbs as well at the turn of a plan by whites to create toilets for the ""diseased"" help.So many other characters and events fill these 464 wonderful pages. This reviewer hardly ever says this about any book, but this is a book you will not be able to put down and will be so, so sorry when it's over. It will change hearts and minds wherever it's experienced!This is Kathryn Stockett's first novel, a brilliant, potent celebration of astonishing and noteworthy hope for light to surmount darkness, be it in a person's color or behavior!

Clary is easy to connect with and she is smart. Sometimes she can't see what is right in front of her but she keeps it together and is determined to find her mom.Simon - Simon is Clary's best friend and I love his humor and optimism.

I really enjoy the comfortableness that is there in his friendship with Clary.Jace - I love his snarky and badass wit. He is smart, brave and just a great character. On the surface he is serious, honest and smart - underneath Clary brings out a more sensitive, caring side. Just like Alec says - Jace thinks he needs to save the world.Isabelle - I love Isabelle's way. She isn't out rightly a nice person but she isn't a mean person either - just really honest and a bit arrogant. My favourite scene with her is right at the end with Clary - where have a beautiful bonding moment.Alec - Initially Alec comes across really rude and offish, especially towards Clary. I could see why Alec seemed put out by Clary. It's as if Jace doesn't need him anymore and is utterly absorbed by Clary. I could see his troubles and I think great things will still come for Alec.Magnus Bane - I loved Magnus in The Infernal Devices. I don't feel he played a huge part in this story but I do think (and hope) to see more of him in the rest of the series.Hodge - Hodge is such a misunderstood character, I felt so sorry for him. I don't think he really knows where his loyalties and heart lie. He may have started off on one side, but near the end he makes some decisions to help people, regardless of what is in store for him.I cannot say I have one favourite character - I love them all!Plot, Pace, Writing style: 5/5The plot was captivating and gripping.

In the case of Gone Girl, Gillian Flynn's third crime thriller, the trouble isn't so much that I have to give away specific plot details as that I have to discuss the narrative structure in a way that might make alert readers able to predict some of those details when they otherwise wouldn't have. Those who want to experience the novel without such inadvertent guidance should avoid reading beyond the first paragraph of this review, and content themselves with this capsule statement: Gone Girl is a compelling page-turner, but turns away from the insight into real human behavior that might have made it a literary as well as a plot-driven triumph.That ultimate lack of insight is all the more disappointing because the book initially suggests a nuanced and thoroughly contemporary character study. The protagonists, Nick Dunne and his wife Amy, were writers in New York City until the economic downturn left them both jobless. The nearly-simultaneous news that Nick's mother was terminally ill made a move back to his Missouri hometown seem like a good idea. But within two years their already-fragile relationship is so strained that when Amy disappears on the morning of their fifth wedding anniversary, Nick soon becomes the prime suspect. His first-person narration of events after the disappearance alternates with Amy's diary entries about their life together, and between the two accounts there are enough questions raised to make a reader wonder whether Nick, an admitted liar, is really capable of murder.This first section of the novel, which takes up about half of its 400 pages, is a brilliant blend of plot development and character work. Both Nick and Amy are complicated, frustrating, ultimately sympathetic human beings, and the emotional dynamics of their marriage, which threaten to undermine their obvious mutual love, reflect modern problems of gender, gender roles, and sexism. Nick is a bit of a cad, spoiled, selfish, sometimes petulant, often blind to his wife's needs, while Amy is so concerned with being a generous, understanding, non-traditional wife that she can't bring herself to admit the existence of those needs. All this plays out against the backdrop of the uncertain modern economy, in which not just the Dunnes but their neighborhood of abandoned McMansions, their town of unemployed, rootless indigents, seem permanently perched on the brink of disaster. If the rest of the book had maintained this emphasis on character and setting, Gone Girl would have been one of my favorite novels of the year.Instead, the halfway point brings a plot twist that throws everything you think you know into doubt. As a story development this is mostly well achieved, though one of the devices used verges on a narrative cheat and I'm not sure of the plausibility of certain points. The problem is that the revelation completely undermines the established characterization, and what replaces it isn't nearly as interesting as the Nick and Amy you thought you were reading about. Personalities like the one that dominates the second half of Gone Girl do exist, but they're rare in real life and overexposed in crime fiction, where they allow for twisty plotting and chilling (but ultimately less than profound) character study. As a story this one is indeed satisfying-- I read the last 200 pages in a single sitting-- but it doesn't really have anything to say about the world we live in. Near the end there's something approaching a theme about the nature of love, but the character and plot points involved are so exaggerated that its deeper relevance is minimal.Here as in her first two books, Gillian Flynn is a sharp, distinctive, often funny writer whose prose is compulsively readable without sacrificing character voice. She knows how to contrive and select details and incidents that make her protagonists distinctive as individuals yet recognizable as people dealing with universal human dilemmas. And she can shape a plot like nobody's business. Unfortunately, in the case of Gone Girl the latter skill works to the detriment of the former ones, with story swallowing theme and character. The book does too much too well not to earn a recommendation, but it's also a deeply frustrating experience. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(4311, 4325)",1,0.0,False

Not typical mysteries, the books meander gracefully to their conclusion rather than proceeding with page-turning thrills. As Assistant Detective Grace Makutsi says, ""Mma Ramotswe [proprietor of the No.1 Ladies Detective Agency] does not solve crimes. She deals with very small things. [...] But [...] these small things are important for people"" (53).Set in Botswana, the books are full of full of wisdom and humanity as well as sympathetic and subtly drawn characters. Smith writes in such a way to emphasize the different pace of life in Botswana. Just reading one of the No.1 Ladies Detective Agency books forces the reader to slow done and relax, making them the perfect fare for a weekday evening.In Blue Shoes and Happiness, Precious Ramotswe and her detective agency take on a number of new cases; her new assistant-assistant detective gets a chance to prove his detecting skills; and a new character appears in the form of Aunty Emang, the local newspaper's agony aunt. Additionally, Grace Makutsi's relationship with her new fiance is on rocky ground after she admits to being a feminist. The novel's most shocking thread, however, concerns Precious Ramotswe's decision to go on a diet. Yes, there's blackmail, and a home intruder, and a cobra in the office, but none of these things is nearly as significant as Ramotswe, a champion of the rights of the ""traditionally-built,"" deciding that she needs to lose weight.While the books do stand alone--each begins with a little summary of what has happened in the previous books--people new to the series should probably start with a different book. Blue Shoes and Happiness, while continuing in the same vein as the earlier books, may be slightly less accessible to neophytes. Readers familiar with Ramotswe and the No.1 Ladies Detective Agency novels will appreciate the mysterious pumpkin that threads its way through the book and Smith's exploration of gender issues. To others, these things may feel just a bit too foreign.Armchair Interviews says: While Blue Shoes and Happiness may not be the best book way for new readers to be introduced to the series, however, fans of Precious Ramotswe and the No.1 Ladies Detective Agency will find it enchanting.

Chosen through a drawing created by the corrupt government of Panem, one boy and one girl from each district is sent to the games. The children must fight to the death and the winner is the only one left alive. Katniss must choose between life, love, and loyalty in a story that makes us question our ideas of quality entertainment. The Hunger Games is the first in a trilogy with the final book being released in summer 2010.Sarah's review:The Hunger Games is a delicious morsel of a book that leaves me starving for more. Although it is considered young adult literature, the themes of the book relate to teens and adults alike. The story is told from Katniss's point of view and the reader is really able to get inside her head. She is the warrior every teenage girl hopes she will be. The love story that begins to unfold is juicy and enticing and I had to follow up immediately with the second installment in the series, Catching Fire. The Hunger Games is an adventure from start to finish. It's a quick read but will stay on the mind long after you are through. Although the concept of the book seems farfetched, it makes one think about how far reality TV will go and exactly what we consider to be entertainment. Why do millions of Americans engross themselves in shows like Survivor, or worse yet, Jersey Shore? As for me? I'll stick to books like The Hunger Games.Erienne's review:Suzanne Collins does a superb job with her first book in The Hunger Games trilogy. Not only is the novel filled with excitement that leaves you not wanting to put it down, it is also jam packed with thought provoking issues such as desensitization and the value of human life. The gruesome death match is aired on television for all to see and the people of Panem are required to watch. While the people in the districts do not particularly enjoy this, those within the Capitol find it intriguing. Viewers cheer for their favorite contender and simply watch while the chosen children kill one another in hopes of being the last remaining survivor. The onlookers within the Capitol hold little regard for who lives or dies while those within the districts are watching for even a glimpse of their representative. While The Hunger Games is a book where you will find love and excitement, it is also a book that will leave you thinking about many of the issues that we encounter today.

This book takes two emotionally screwed up characters and tells the story about how they find salvation in one another.  This is not a typical YA novel.  Yes, main character Noah is self-confident, brash and tattooed, and main character Echo is beautiful, smart and funny, but that is where the  similarities to normal YA-type teenagers end.  This book contains copious amounts of swearing, drugs, sexual situations and heavily damaged people.  This is not your run-of-the-mill light and happy read about teenaged angst.This book changes point of view quite frequently, telling the story from both Echo's and Noah's perspective. Echo and Noah are both assigned a therapist at their Kentucky high school for vastly different reasons.  Echo has suffered an unthinkable crime against her, that her mind cannot bring itself to remember.  She has been left scarred, both emotionally and physically from this crime.  On top of this tragedy, she is dealing with normal high school angst - her social situation, her parents' divorce and her father's subsequent remarriage to her former baby sitter, her mother's disappearance, and her extremely strained relationship with her father and stepmother.  Noah is a foster child that has been moved between families several times in the previous two years.  Where he was once an all-star athlete from a Rockwellian American family, he is now considered a stoner and a punk.  He's very intelligent, yet refuses to take school seriously.  He hangs out with the ""wrong"" crowd and is best known for being gorgeous, yet a player.  He is only into one-night stands and smoking pot.Noah needs help, though.  He has two younger brothers in the foster system that he wants to gain custody of, and in order to do that, he needs to pass drug tests, pull his GPA up and find a job.  Echo is in need of extra money.  Although her father has money, he won't lend her any to finish fixing up the car that her deceased brother was working on before his death.  Echo is asked to tutor Noah, therefore earning extra money.Soon after Echo was attacked, she came back to school as a social introvert.  She was known formerly as the popular, beautiful girl who dated the captain of the basketball team.  When she returned to school after the episode, she had broken up with her boyfriend and was seen as a social outcast.  Her friends have been trying very hard to get her back into school society, and having any contact with Noah the stoner is a social faux pas.  The relationship between Noah and Echo gets off to a rocky start.  He sees her scars, which she usually keeps hidden.  Echo is afraid that Noah will tell the entire school about them.Noah has a chip on his shoulder, too, although he does not care about what his classmates think about him.  Noah came from an idyllic family.  He had loving parents, a home, a place in his school's society before tragedy struck him.  He is used to keeping his guard up, because  the state foster system has not been a good experience for him.  Noah, though, is ready for a girl like Echo, and he's been waiting for her.Noah and Echo travel a path of lows and highs in their relationship, each one trying to hash out their personal lives without hurting the other.  They fall hard for one another, but sometimes love just isn't enough.  Noah is still attempting to reunite his family, and Echo is still trying to reconcile what tragedy happened to her and who's fault it was.  Echo is struggling with her desire to be loved by those that matter most to her, while Noah is struggling with a never ending loneliness, a hole in his heart that he can't seem to fill.I have to mention that both of Echo's parents are not model parents.  We do meet Echo's mom and although she has issues that are out of her control, she is one of the worst mothers I have come across in literature.  She is selfish and unrelenting.  Where once Echo holds her mom in high regard, we learn how truly wrong Echo was.  While Echo is only looking for acceptance and love from her father, we learn about some terribly bad decisions he made that will affect Echo for the rest of her life.The ending of this book is action packed and emotional.  The two things that these characters are fighting for, Noah for his brothers and Echo for her memories and sanity, come quickly to a head.  We learn a lot about the pasts of these characters, and we see how they grow up and change through this novel.  Although both Noah and Echo have less than desirable pasts, they find refuge in one another and it's a beautiful thing.  This book is an excellent study in character development and I urge you to run to the nearest book store and pick up a copy. ANSWERNOTFOUND",relationship,"(2622, 2634)",1,0.0,False

K. Rowling. The Harry Potter books will forever be part of our culture. So, with that series ended, Rowling's announcement that she was writing an adult novel was greeted with much (much!) anticipation.And with it's publication - much scrutiny. As a fan of the Potter books, I had to read The Casual Vacancy.""6.11  A casual vacancy is deemed to have occurred :(a)  when a local councillor fails to make his declaration of acceptance of office within the proper time; or(b) when his notice of resignation is received';or(c) on the day of his death...""And in the parish of Pagford, England, it's option (c) when councillor Barry Fairbrother unexpectedly dies. The local council is warring amongst themselves. The issue? Who should be responsible for the local estate - referred to as The Fields. Should it be Pagford or neighbouring city of Yarvil. This vacancy offers up the chance to turn the tide for one side or the other...the race is on to fill the seat....'Both, as they watched....were contemplating the casual vacancy: and they saw it not as an empty space but as a magician's pocket, full of possibilities.""Rowling rapidly introduces us to a plethora of characters. Each is well-drawn and provided me with  vivid mental images. Inthe beginning I did have to make myself a reference list of characters and their relationships until I had a firm grasp of who was who.The Casual Vacancy is driven by it's characters. Most of them are not nice people. But it's an interesting social commentary. The 'better-offs' in Pagford are quite sure they are above those 'lower classes' living in The Fields. But our behind the scenes view allows us to see that they are no different from each other. The Pagfordians are just more polite about it.The Casual Vacancy is not a small book - it's five hundred pages long. Although I'm a voracious reader, it took me almost two weeks to finish. Why? Well, packed into that five hundred pages is a lot of pettiness, bullying, selfishness, cruelty, vindictiveness, conniving, scheming...you get the picture. And it made me sad, just really sad. I really didn't get much enjoyment from reading this book. But I soldiered on, determined to see what happened at the end. Which I didn't like. The one character I enjoyed met a depressing fate.Rowling's writing is impeccable, the town and the machinations of it's inhabitants are all part of a tightly woven plot and her characterizations are spot on. So it's going to be a very hard book to rate for me. The writing is a four, but my enjoyment was only a three, so I'll go with 3.5/5.The Casual Vacancy is definitely an adult novel, with lots of profanity, drug use, self harm, sexual situations and more.

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the kind of book that would have intrigued me at age 12 or there abouts--a young boy who's something of a misfit in his everyday life, suddenly discovers that he's actually much more. There's something secret, special, and interesting about him that nobody dared guess.As far as this theme goes, this book is one of many, nothing special. Heck, for a while, almost every Disney movie carried exactly this trope. What makes Harry Potter stand out is the creativity of J. K. Rowling. Is she a prose-master? Not exactly. But as fantasy lit for kids goes, the writing is intelligent, yet fast-paced and readable. The characters, both major and minor, are vivid, sympathetic, and brilliantly developed. Rowling's world-building skills are also incredibly good. The profusion of funny incidental items she introduces into the story, from the Nimbus 2000 flying broom to Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans help add a certain quirkiness that is undeniably charming.However, my opinion of the value of mainly escapist fantasy literature has changed substantially in the 25-odd years since I was 12. In the interim, I have realized that life itself is interesting enough and that if you're easily bored with it, it's most likely because you're a boring person. Therefore, for a book of this sort to have some real value--especially for younger readers--it needs to teach them something good and noble about real life outside of Hogwarts Academy. It is on this point that Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone stumbles. My main criticism of the book can be summed up in one sentence:""Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking the rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it."" (pg. 181)Upon finishing the book, it was that sentence that stuck with me. To paraphrase the apparent message: rules are for stuck-up prigs, and if you want to get anywhere and have people like you, you need to break 'em with abandon, even if you lack the experience necessary to fathom why the rules are there in the first place. Again, this is a standard Disney-style trope that I have always hated. And to make matters worse, Harry and his friends are rewarded repeatedly in the aftermath of their rule-breaking. It was a disappointment to me (and a literary mistake, if I may be so bold) at the end that Harry and Gryffindor were awarded enough points at the last possible second to give them the House Cup. It actually made me feel bad for Slytherin--as a Philadelphia sports fan, I know that feeling of being ripped off by the officials all too well.This annoying element is mostly balanced out, however, by the overriding sense of good and evil that is present throughout the book. ""There is no good and evil,"" says the slavish and simpering Professor Quirrell, servant of the evil Voldemort, ""only power and those too weak to seek it"" (pg. 291). To its credit, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is not a relativistic book. Evil is well defined. Good is also presented, though perhaps a bit more vaguely and occasionally with a Machievellian undercurrent--in the fight against evil, the rules are not all that important. Love, particularly familial and self-sacrificial love, is also extolled.Having only read the first book in the series, I'll give Rowling the benefit of the doubt when it comes to the rule-breaking stuff. Perhaps she's got a reasonable explanation for it in the future volumes. I'll be looking for it as I read volumes 2 through 7. I must say, though, that there are plenty of fantasy lit books for young people out there that do a much better job of tackling the subject of good and evil than this one, among themNiamh and the Hermit: A Fairy TaleandDream of Fire.As for the common criticism that the Harry Potter series is a gateway to the occult, both Fr. Amorth, a famous exorcist, and Pope Benedict XVI (albeit before he was elected Pope) have warned about this, so the subject shouldn't be taken lightly. As far as I could tell, for a well-catechized young person over the age of 13 or 14, this book should cause no problem in that regard. However, if the reader is an impressionable child of 8 or 9 who is not well-catechized, I would be a lot more cautious. If they must read it, I would strongly encourage a parent to read along with them. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(4441, 4455)",1,0.0,False

Virtually the whole cast is multi-dimensioned and nuanced.  The author skillfully sets up a conflict between good and evil, but there is nothing over-the-top in either direction--these are real people reflecting their times and circumstances.  It gets pretty ugly when the story dips into the racial history of the South--Mississippi in particular--but there is always the hope of redemption held out for contemporary characters who are the heart of the book.So ""Sycamore Row"" is, at its base, a very, very entertaining story.

Thor was one of my favorite brothers and his story was flat for my taste, so I was very curious to see how J.R. Ward solved the love between Qhuinn and Blay.I was so happy, that J.R. Ward did it again! Lover at Last was in the same level of a brilliantly written story as the first books in the BDB series. With that said, it seems that Black Dagger Brotherhood's brothers are all covered with their own books by now and it is going to be interesting to see, if more new brothers will show up in the future books. J.R. Ward built up the story in a way, that next book will probably NOT be about a brother, but about one of the other creatures introduced previously - either a Shadow or a Chosen or a vampire or a member of Glymera or Band of Bastards. Let's wait and see. And now, back to Qhuinn and Blay.Plot and characters:Lover at Last was a story of Qhuinn and Blay and it was not so much about if they ever would be together, but more about how they will end up together. The main storyline the novel dealt with is about Qhuinn finally finding an identity of his own and understanding what he wants and who he really is. He does not think he deserves Blay whom he deeply loves. And then there is Blay who has been hurt by Qhuinn one too many times, but they can't deny the heavy physical and also mental attraction between them.What I disliked about the story?It took them so long! Way too long! One of them is not telling the truth and the other is not talking about his feelings and that goes on for a while. There were times when I wanted to yell at them: For God's sake, MAN up!What I loved about the story?I loved basically everything else in the story. I loved that Qhuinn finds his place and becomes a brother. This is exactly what the BDB series is about:  about loyalty, braveness, being a warrior, being a brother! I absolutely adored how he tried to approach Blay with his softer side and opened up for topics that were painful for him. I loved how he grew with the story - looking back to his past (I loved the flashbacks by the way) and finally coming to terms with himself. What is there not to love about Qhuinn?!! A true male of worth!I adored the relationship Blay had with his family and how they embraced Qhuinn as well. The scenes featuring Blay's family were heart-warming and very well written.I was very happy to see all the other BDB brothers plus Lassiter plus Rehvenge showing up in Lover at Last. Wrath was awesome in Lover at Last! The scene where he speaks to Glymera was powerful, so you could actually feel his presence in the room as the greatest royalty ever! Surprisingly, there were less Lessers in this book and the main struggles went between the Brotherhood and the Band of Bastards and the Glymera.There were few side stories in Lover at Least, which I enjoyed! I know that there are reviewers who hated the amount of story lines in Lover at Last, but I think they balanced the love story between Qhuinn and Blay. Otherwise the book would have been too short and too cheesy. We all knew they would be together and bringing them together could not be 400 pages long. So for me, the side stories were welcomed!I haven't been the biggest fan of the Chosen ones, far from it! Layla turned me towards liking them little better. I truly hope the author finds a proper solution for her and Xcor in upcoming books. It's going to be very interesting to see the fate of Xcor - a guy who tried to kill the king, is the traitor and now finds himself in a position of respecting the Brotherhood for their treatment of Layla. Can't wait to read, what is going to happen to them.I loved the cat-and-mouse game between Assail and Marisol. Assail is definitely a character whom I would love to hear much more about.Generally:I enjoyed it a lot. Even though I am a hard core fan of BDB series, I do welcome new characters and stories showing up in J.R. Ward's books. It was fun and entertaining page turner. I highly recommend it!

The story of an aspiring young magician, Kvothe, who seeks entry to the prestigious University to become an arcanist, does seem rather Harry Potterish, though this is by no means a disparaging comparison.What distinguishes this fantasy novel from others of its ilk is the rather believable magic the author conjures. For instance, this first of a trilogy introduces us to ""sympathy"", a magical force which boasts elements of scientific concepts like thermodynamics, in the way objects can be moved by creating a sympathetic link between them to transfer energy.To Rothfuss's credit, he manages to create a fictional world that runs rather consistently according to a system he imagines. Kvothe's musical background is established by his childhood as part of the Edema Ruh, a troupe of people very much like the travelling minstrels, and music features as much as magic in the story. The inciting incident that throws young Kvothe into action is perhaps the murder of his parents and entire troupe by the Chandrian, a mythical evil force that is the stuff of faerie tales even in Kvothe's world, which complicates his quest to avenge his parents. Do the Chanrians exist or don't they? In the process, he becomes a street urchin for a period of three years, during which he learns a little about the Chandrian, and confirms his resolve to learn as much as he can about them by setting out for the University.However, the reader becomes very aware of the narrative lapsing into that of pre-pubescent boy, who is suitably enamoured with the first mysterious beauty, Denna, whom he meets enroute to the University, and who continues to appear in his life years later. Our young hero is caught gawking at women's bodies like a hormonal teen in parts of his narrative, while at the same time becoming obsessed with Denna despite her cruelty and contrary signals to him. One can't help but be irritated by Kvothe's willingness to explain her irresponsible behaviour away to his two best friends at the Uni in a very unconvincing conversation near the close of the book.The action in the novel is tempered by these distractions, especially in an episode with a draccus (a mythical dragonlike lizard) where he and Denna flirt, while also plotting to slay the creature. Arguably, the narrative structure also serves to distract, rather than add to the telling of the tale. I couldn't help but feel that the narrative frame of the adult Kvothe narrating the story to a Chronicler at an inn, is an unnecessary complication. Perhaps I would be proven wrong after reading the other two books in the trilogy (the third book still pending release at the time of this review). In the meantime, most of the other characters feel flat and undeveloped, largely owing, I feel, to the singular perspective Rothfuss gives to Kvothe throughout his recount of his past.Nonetheless, the story is entertaining, even if the writing is uneven in some parts, with overused phrases like ""safe as houses"". I look forward to Kvothe learning the name of the wind in the next book. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3173, 3187)",2,0.0,False

It seemed that many bloggers were enjoying Drew's story tremendously.  Then, my good bloggy friend, Nereyda, from Mostly YA Book Obsessed, highly recommended it, and I added it to the top of my TBR.  When I was offered the book for review, I quickly snatched it up, and crossed my fingers that it would live up to all of the hype, and believe me, it did!  At the end of the book, we even get a short little excerpt leading in to the next installment, Twisted, which will be told from the female character's point of view, Kate.If you have been in a reading funk or are looking for something to lift your spirits, look no further.  Tangled is such a fun, humorous, sexy, and romantic story!  I found myself chuckling and full out laughing throughout this story.  It was highly entertaining, as it was told through Drew's view point; a sexy, intelligent, ambitious, and cocky womanizer, who always gets what he wants, when he wants it!  Drew was such a colorful, witty, and fun character that completely had me engaged, as he told his candid story of falling in love for the very first time.  I loved reading from the male point of view.  This story felt authentic, and it would be perfect for the big screen!At the beginning of the story, we get a devastated Drew, who is heart broken, (though he claims he's just sick with the flu) because things did not work out with Kate, (the woman he fell in love with.)  He then flashes back to the first time he met Kate, and tells us the story of how he fell in love, and ended up in his present state.  Along the way, we are entertained by Drew's factoids on the way the male brain works, the life he led before he met Kate, and how everything changed for him when she entered his life.  Kate was a fabulous character.  She was strong, independent, witty, intelligent, and ambitious.  When Drew and Kate were in the same scenes, fireworks always erupted.  Whether it was from sexual tension, these two competing against one another through work sabotage, or hot love scenes, the excitement never ended!  It was fun watching the verbal foreplay between Drew and Kate.  These two loved to argue, but their banter was always witty, fun, passionate, and humorous.I enjoyed getting to know the side characters as well.  Alexandra, also know as, &#34;The Bitch,&#34; was Drew's sister, and I loved how all the guys were intimidated by her.  She was such a strong woman, and I had the utmost respect for her character.  Her husband, Steven, was a good friend, husband, and father, but it was obvious who ruled their marriage.  McKenzie, Drew's niece, was a sweet, cute, and inquisitive, 4 year old little dynamo.  She was the apple of Drew's eye, and had me smiling, and laughing whenever she made an appearance.  She had a tendency to repeat everything verbatim, which got Drew into hot water with his sister, quite a few times in the story.  Matthew, Drew's and Steven's other good friend, was a womanizer as well.  In fact, Drew and Matthew were partner's in crime when they went out together on Saturday nights to pick up women at various clubs and bars.  Matthew ends up meeting Kate's best friend, Dolores, (Dee Dee) who give's Alexandra a run for her money in the strong woman department. I loved watching Dee Dee put Drew in his place, as she tried to protect Kate from getting hurt.  She was a loyal friend, and fun character.  We are going to get Dee Dee and Matthew's story in an upcoming installment, Tamed, and I can't wait!!!!My Rating:If you haven't already guessed, I LOVED Tangled, by Emma Chase, and highly recommend it!!!!  The entertainment, flair, and humor in the story reminded me a lot of Wallbanger, by Alice Clayton.  If you enjoyed Wallbanger, I guarantee that Tangled will be a much loved read for you as well.  If you are looking for an instant hit to add to your reading shelf, add Tangled!  You won't be disappointed.  I give Tangled, by Emma Chase, 5 Spectacular, Swoony, Fun, Laugh-Out-Loud Stars!My Favorite Quote:&#34;Women fall in love quicker than men.  Easier and more often.  But when guys fall?

While preparing for the follow up, I reread this first in the Century series in preparation for more vivid characterization and wonderful, intersecting story lines. Who can forget the opening story of Billy Williams going into the dangerous Welsh mines for the first time and his heroic endeavors underground? And, how about the fascinating women of the region:  the fiery Maude, and Ethel, Billy's sister, who rose to become a member of Parliament?  As time  for the release of ""Winter..."" grew near, I pondered the best way to get the book. Fall of Giants, I had in paper version; it was heavy (perfect for lifting weights), or the overpriced Kindle version? I finally decided to invest the money in  the Kindle version, so I wasn't in danger of a slipped disk from the weight of the book. I was also anxious to get started  with a writer I knew would not disappoint.What slow recognition  awaited me! I had carefully read no reviews, so I would not be influenced. Where in the world did Ken Follett go? Did he outline the plot and assign immature writers to ""fill in the blanks""? The rating I have given him is only because of the research and historical knowledge of the times that I have garnered.  I don't mind that the characters are present at every important event of the WWII years.  What I do mind is the shallow characterization of people I feel no reason to like. I really resent the few sections, possibly written by Follett, as in the 101st segment, that are cut off mid section, then summarized later in the book. I really mind the immature sexual scenes that make me dislike the characters even more.This book contract probably had too short a time for Follett and his assistants to meet deadline. It probably should have been divided into two books. At any rate, do not count on me to reread the second in the trilogy in preparation for the third. Also, do not count on me to spend twenty dollars for the next book. I will read the reviews and decide whether I want to waste my money and my time.

I understand that war is not fun and that this series is not Harry Potter, but I never expected this book to be so dark and well, just flat out not fun. The first two books were serious, but action packed and had a certain momentum that kept the pages turning much the same way the Harry Potter series did. But this book is so far different in tone from the other two novels in the series that it's really shocking. There is no momentum whatsoever and there were substantial portions of this book that I started to skim out of sheer boredom, which never happened when I read the first two novels. This book is so strange that the only thing I can really compare it to is the movie Apocalypse Now because it is such a pyschological nightmare and of course the theme in both is that war is hell (""the horror, the horror""). The only difference is that I loved Apocalypse now, but Mockingjay is one of the worst novels (and sequels) that I have ever read. The things Katniss has to endure in this book (district 13 basically as bad as the capital, Peta becoming crazy, her sister being killed in the end, Katniss being burned basically from head to toe) is just flat out brutal. I guess I am naive because I expected this book to be kind of Star Warsish with the districts (the rebels) taking on and beating the evil capital in a thrilling conclusion. I figured Gale or Peta would die heroically and Katniss would live happily ever after with the survivor. But instead Katniss ends up broken both mentally and physically. I assume the author was not satisfied with writing something that was just a fun piece of popular fiction (like the Harry Potter series) and instead wanted something that would be remembered with the great works of literature (1984, Brave New World, Ender's Game, etc), but if that was the attempt then she has failed miserably. All I can really say in conclusion is that like a lot of people who loved the first two books in the series and I had very high hopes for Mockingjay, but in the end it is one of the most bizzarre, truly ugly novels I have ever read. It is so bad in fact that it will forever cloud my opinion of the series as a whole.

He was already a Navy SEAL at this point, but he was trying to become a member of the elite Seal TEAM Six, which is composed of the ""best of the best.""  We follow his deployments in both Iraq and Afghanistan, where the recounting of certain missions serves to establish the proficiency of the author and his team at their job.  This is rather standard fare for the subgenre.The latter half of the book is devoted to the raid on Osama bin Laden's compound, including the extensive preparations and some of the political aftermath.  The actual raid is told in almost moment-by-moment detail, transporting the reader to the compound in Abbottabad.  The scene is described so richly that it feels as though we are climbing the stairs with the team as they close in on bin Laden.  Several maps and charts help us to picture the location.No Easy Day focuses almost exclusively on Bissonnette's training and deployments.  We learn very little about his personal life, which--combined with his intentional pseudonymity--makes it harder to connect with him emotionally.  This information was omitted for obvious security reasons.  He does share the toll that SEAL life takes on family life, however.  ""Many of my teammates suffered through bitter divorces.  We missed weddings, funerals, and holidays.  We couldn't tell the Navy no, but we could tell our families no.  And we did often. . . . Work was always the number one priority.  It took everything out of you and gave back very little. . . . everything else in the world took a backseat"" (106-7).  For those wanting a fuller portrait of a Navy SEAL's personal life, see the excellent book by Eric Blehm,Fearless: The Undaunted Courage and Ultimate Sacrifice of Navy SEAL Team SIX Operator Adam Brown, which details the life of SEAL Team Six operator Adam Brown.Bissonnette does not engage in self-aggrandizement or bravado, which has marred some earlier books by former Navy SEALs.  The author seems to have a realistic view of himself.  He says at one point: ""I am not unique or special"" (298).  He does not hesitate to share instances in combat when he was afraid or made a mistake.  He occasionally engages in self-deprecating humor.  He regularly dishes out praise for his teammates.  Bissonnette says that today's SEALs have ""evolved past being egomaniacs"" (289).  Such professionalism is appreciated.Bissonnette states in the introduction that he has sanitized the book so that it presents no threat to national security.  The identities of those involved are masked; special tactics and technology are not revealed; and certain information is generalized.  The author says, ""If you are looking for secrets, this is not your book"" (x).  Yet none of these precautions affect the impact of the book.  There is still enough specific information to make the action riveting.Despite Bissonnette's precautions, the book is nonetheless generating controversy.  Some special operators have challenged his decision to reveal details about the mission, breaking their traditional code of silence.  The Department of Defense has threatened to sue because he did not present the book to the Pentagon for inspection prior to publication.  The author has responded by pointing out that many people, from the President on down, have revealed details about the mission.  He says, ""If my commander in chief is willing to talk, then I feel comfortable doing the same"" (298).  He claims that everything in the book has already appeared in other unclassified sources (xi).  I for one am glad that the book was released.  It shows that those who commit acts of terror will suffer retribution--perhaps even deadly retribution--for their evil.  This should serve as a warning to our enemies.At the end of the book are the names of those SEALs who have paid the ultimate price since September 11, 2001.  Bissonnette claims that he is donating the majority of the proceeds from the book to charities that support the families of these fallen Navy SEALs.  He encourages readers to donate as well.The book is well-written and a page-turner.  Even though the outcome of the book was already known, it maintains a high degree of suspense throughout to see how the situation actually played out.  I read it in one sitting.  Highly recommended.

I've read some Stephen King, but post-apocalyptic/horror fiction isn't normally my thing.  Still, this book pulled me in.  Cronin created such a harrowing vision of science gone awry that I was haunted for days by this tale of humanity fighting to survive its own deadly creations.  I very much enjoyed the main characters and their development throughout the book, even as the plot took quite unexpected twists and turns.  And I enjoyed Cronin's take on the hero's journey... here, a 'passage'... that transform the hero and his world.  It's explored in many layers and I enjoyed the nuances.  In the end, it was such a haunting and riveting experience that I think I will be one of the first to buy the next book.That having been said, I'll echo many reviewers here who believe the book should have been edited down somewhat.  The plot becomes bogged down at times with overly verbose backstories and descriptive prose.  Like many here, I became restless with the pace at times and began skimming through paragraphs in the burdensome middle portion.  The book is at its best when the prose thins and sharpens to a sharp edge... and then the plot zooms along that edge providing quite a disturbing thrill!I'm not saying the pace always needed to be at a heightened pitch.  However, the plot would often wander or grind to a halt for far too long.  I have had an internal debate as to whether or not the meandering prose in the middle of the book was necessary to build the suspense and to support the plot's infrastructure, but in the end I still believe the book would have benefited from some moderate selective editing of the substories.  I believe my impatience with the middle also stemmed from the structure of the story.  By the time I had achieved a level of buy-in and commitment to the characters and storyline of the first part of the book, the story took a stark turn that required me to start the process all over again.  It took me quite a long time to re-buy into the book in the second [larger] portion, which probably heightened my impatience with the story building in this section.  I'm not sure there was a way around this stark break in the story, I just wish the author had handled it a little more deftly.But I endured the middle portion and, in the end, the payoff was well worth it.

The book does have a number of things  going for it, starting with a solid protagonist. Josie Baylor-Bates is a former hot shot defense attorney whose career pretty much fell apart several years earlier when she won an acquittal for a defendant in a high profile case who then went home and murdered her children in rather gruesome fashion. Josie fled the spotlight to a small California beach community where she spends her time on nickel-and-dime cases.All that changes when a former college friend, Linda Rayburn, hires Josie to defend her daughter, Hannah Sheraton, a troubled teenager who is accused of murdering her step-grandfather, who was a justice on the California Supreme Court. Linda's husband has been named by the governor to succeed his father on the court, and both Linda and her husband want Josie to find a way to make the case go away and get Hannah some professional help. Josie, however, winds up becoming convinced of Hannah's innocence and realizes the girl's parents may not have her best interests at heart.The book is written primarily from Josie's viewpoint and allows readers considerable insight into Josie's thought processes. When it does so, it's often gripping. Josie has to continually wrestle with demons from her own troubled younger days as well as the question of whether she's trying to get another dangerous killer off. And, when Josie is examining witnesses, framing her thoughts before she asks questions makes the examination much more interesting.Unfortunately, author Forster also chooses to take readers inside the heads of other characters during portions of the book and she is considerably less successful there. Some of these characters have things to hide (understandable in a mystery thriller), but when Forster tries to write around this, the inner narrative becomes awkward at best and downright dishonest in a few places. And, when Forster tries to go inside the heads of multiple characters in the same scene (as in a couple of key encounters in the later stages of the book), the book's pacing slows down far too much. These sections needed tighter editing to cut away unnecessary verbiage and let inherently dramatic dialogue speak for itself without expanding on the characters' thought processes behind almost every single sentence.Forster also apparently is not an attorney (but is married to one) and her depiction of the legal proceedings sometimes sacrifices accuracy for drama. Josie, in the best tradition of Matlock and Perry Mason, is given free rein to wander all over the place a couple of times while the judge and DA vanish into the woodwork. In addition, the sequence of events described in the trial just couldn't have happened in real life. Plus, Forster pulls some key bits of evidence seemingly out of thin air with no introduction or foreshadowing. It's a technique that works at first but becomes annoying later in the book.The book, despite its flaws, has a likable, sympathetic (albeit flawed) main character and a defendant whose psychological problems play out quite credibly and sympathetically. Readers will want Josie to succeed and help Hannah. As for Hannah, readers will wind up shaking their heads at some of Hannah's bad choices but seeing the troubled, frightened teenage girl inside (a complex character nicely rendered by Forster). Also, as a mystery, Forster lays out the plot rather well and disguising the clues nicely. Despite a fairly limited number of characters, readers will probably have a hard time guessing exactly what went on much before Josie herself does.On balance, Hostile Witness succeeds as both character drama and legal thriller. The book starts out strong and maintains its pace for about two-thirds of its length before starting to meander when it should be getting more focused. Still, the momentum that Forster builds earlier in the book should keep readers going until the last pages. Josie is an unusual and likable fictional attorney whose future cases should probably prove rather interesting. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(4216, 4230)",5,0.0,False

My gripes with the book were much like other peoples (it was too long - could have used some better editing) and although I enjoyed it, it wasn't one of my real favorites, falling just below Chamber of Secrets (CoS) as my least favorite HP book.However, since reading Half-Blood Prince (HBP) (when it came out and about a year ago - I plan to tackle it next, wanting to read it before Deathly Hallows (DH) comes out), I find that my views on OoP are different. Having seen where HBP goes, OoP makes sense to me now. Harry's anger, the prophecy, all of JK's decisions as to what needed to happen in OoP make total sense. When I first read it, a lot of things turned me off. Yeah, it was too long, Harry's anger really bothered me, the fact that she used a device such as a prophecy really turned me off (which wasn't really her fault, to be honest - it just seemed that everyone (Star Wars, Alias, etc) was using `prophecies' as a reason for one person have to kill another), that the book seemed so negative all the time, Sirius' death, and a lot of other things just made me not like the book. But now, I've changed my mind about a lot of it. Harry's anger is totally founded and didn't bother me as much (it really showed us how much he's grown and will grow in HBP), The Prophecy is actually pretty cool, and Sirius' death still isn't great but I understand it.I enjoyed the book much better than I had the other two times I read it.

It seemed as though a lot contemporary romance books (of late) had been following a similar story line, it was getting predictable.  So, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that Wanted is very much it's own story with fresh characters, plenty of heated scenes, and a storyline that drew me further into the book.Angelina is a woman with secrets and a past that kept her from being true to herself.  When her beloved Uncle Jahn dies, Angelina is left without her rock to lean on.  She struggles between her natural inclination to be a rebel, to live freely and her fear that letting loose will hurt those she loves.  I found it easy to identify with Angie, and she is a character that intrigued me from the first page.  Then there's Evan.  Evan has his own secrets and he pushes Angie away at first, for fear of drawing her into his dark world and a promise he had made to the late Uncle Jahn.  But, Angie and Evan have a sizzling chemistry between them that neither can resist.When I say that Evan has secrets and pushes Angelina away, it is because of secrets.  Evan does not have the deep-seeded emotional damage that some contemporary romance men have.  Evan is a man who developed his business to take care of his family by any means necessary.  Some of those means could mean big trouble for Evan, his business partners, and the people closest to him.  I really like that Evan is a different type of dangerous man.  He likes to be dominant and in charge, in life and in the bedroom, but not obsessively so.  He wants Angelina to make her own life choices, he does not make them for her or force her to his will.  Their relationship developed from a long period of friendship and closeness, so I believed their romance as a couple.Along with steamy romance and fresh characters, J. Kenner delivered a story of intrigue as well.  Evan and his business partners had drawn the attention of the FBI and there was a matter of stolen art that brought suspense and a bit of adventure to the book.  Overall, Wanted proved to be a very entertaining read.  I will definitely be reading  more of this series in the future, as I am curious to learn what Evan's business partners, his best friends, will be up to next.  I have read J.

Although the distinction between literary fiction and genre fiction is not cut-and-dry&#8212;for instance, Elizabeth Kostova&#8217;s novel, The Historian, fits both genres--I&#8217;d say that genre fiction places emphasis upon a fast-moving, interesting plot, while literary fiction privileges psychologically nuanced characterizations and a unique narrative style.Death characterized the Holocaust, and Death is the real narrator of the novel, which begins with the heroine&#8217;s end: Liesel Meminger&#8217;s death, many years after WWII, after she&#8217;s lived a full life and had children and grandchildren of her own. As Death carries the elderly woman&#8217;s soul to the other side, it also takes and narrates her childhood diary.In the late 1930&#8217;s and early 40&#8217;s, Liesel is a young adopted girl living in Germany. She has her first encounter with Death when her brother, Werner Meminger, who is also given up for adoption along with her, dies on the train to Molching. He&#8217;s buried by the railway station. That day, Liesel&#8217;s obsession with books&#8212;and death--begins. She picks up The Grave Digger&#8217;s Handbook, a book dropped by the funeral director at her brother&#8217;s funeral.Shortly thereafter, the distraught girl joins what might be seen as a typical German family, with whom she bonds quickly. Liesel&#8217;s adoptive father, Hans Hubermann, is a loyal German, who served during WWI, but is not sympathetic to the Nazi regime. Despite his reservations, Hans is enlisted in the German army during WWII. Artistic and sensitive&#8212;a painter and accordion player--Hans probably characterizes the attitude of a vast majority of Germans who were not anti-Semitic yet were forced to participate in the Nazi regime. His wife, Rosa, is a no-nonsense woman with a sharp tongue and a loving heart. She washes people&#8217;s clothes to supplement their income but gradually, one by one, her customers fire her.Liesel also meets Max Vandenburg, a Jew hidden by the Hubermann family from the Nazis, whose father fought during WWI alongside Hans Hubermann. Liesel befriends him. When Hans becomes ill, she reads to him. He eventually recovers, in part, the novel suggests, because of the power of friendship transmitted through the act of reading. Liesel and her family have a close call with the Gestapo, as soldiers search their house to see if they can use their basement as a shelter. Fortunately, they deem it too shallow and they leave.In all respects, Liesel blends in with her adoptive family. Their hardships and struggles become hers as well. She becomes especially close friends with Rudy Steiner, a blond &#8220;Aryan&#8221; boy a few months older than her, who develops a crush on her. Although the girl refuses to kiss him, together they embark on many adventures, which bond them to one another. Together, they become book thieves when the Mayor and his wife also fire Rosa. Their love of books and of the forbidden, representing a kind of protest against the Nazi regime and against injustice in life in general, binds the two children even more.Perhaps the strongest character of the novel is Death itself, its main narrator. Death may be brought about by war and by the savage murders perpetrated by the Nazis, but it is not sympathetic to them. Rather, Zusak depicts Death as a kind of Humanist, philosophical character: humane and disapproving of senseless violence, hatred and destruction. In parts, Death touches upon the comic and the absurd, needing &#8220;a vacation&#8221; from its job during the war.I think the strength of this novel lies in its complex characterizations: the German characters in particular are nuanced and multifaceted, not stereotyped in any way. They too struggle with the evils perpetrated by the Nazi regime and try to help victims, as much as they can. In the end, however, they too become victims of Hitler&#8217;s war, as Rosa, Hans and Rudy all die when the Hubermann house is bombed. Rudy doesn&#8217;t even get to experience Liesel&#8217;s first kiss, dying seconds before she finally declares her love for him and kisses him. Only Liesel survives and gets the chance to have a full life.If I were to identify any weakness in the novel it would be in the narrative style. Since style functions as a kind of author&#8217;s unique fingerprint in literary fiction, it&#8217;s largely dependent upon each reader&#8217;s subjective taste. The choppy, short sentences and disjointed, subjective structure of the novel weren&#8217;t to my personal taste, particularly since I usually look for a dense, sweeping and well-informed description of lived history in Holocaust literature. This novel, however, is impressionistic in both style and structure. But these stylistic features also made The Book Thief popular with readers of all ages, particularly with young readers, who could identify with the characters and appreciate its accessible form. Due to its literary success, The Book Thief was recently made into a movie directed by Brian Percival, released in November 2013. The movie, however, unlike the book, received mixed reviews.Claudia Moscovici, Literature Salon ANSWERNOTFOUND",novel won numerous literary awards,"(148, 182)",1,0.3,False

Angelfall grabbed me from the very first chapters. Filled with action and suspense, mystery and anticipation, I quickly became engrossed in this world and its story. Susan Ee has the great ability to combine great suspense and mystery with compelling characters and a storyline that leaves you eager for what's to come.I don't want to give away a lot of details about this story. I personally didn't know much going in, and I found it really added to my enjoyment and the intensity of what was going on, or what I anticipated might happen. But I will say that the story is set in essentially a post-apocalyptic setting, but I wouldn't completely define it that way. Because there is so much more going on beyond the surface. (And even after finishing the second book, there is still so much more for me to learn). Humanity is in jeopardy and &#34;angels&#34; have come for some unknown reason, and in this case, these &#34;angels&#34; are not the good guys. And while this big picture is happening, we have Penryn, trying to care for her mentally unstable mother and crippled sister. Penryn meets Raffe after he is attacked and her sister is kidnapped and they make a tentative agreement to help each other. Beyond this, I will leave the rest to the reading. But let me just say, there is so much more than meets the eye. There are twists and turns. There are questions on top of questions. There are some very disturbing developments that seriously creeped me out.And then there are the characters...Penryn is such a great heroine and narrator. She is one of my favorite female kick-butt characters. She is strong yet compassionate, wise yet youthful, loyal yet fierce. I felt like she was such a genuine addition to the female YA heroine group. She was so well developed, having so many strengths yet also vulnerabilities you would expect in someone her age, but she also has such wisdom as someone who has lived through so much even before all this other business took place. Loved her!Raffe is the perfect mystery. He has this sarcasm and humor to him that you wouldn't expect, this tender side he hides, and this sheath of mystery and intrigue that pulls you right in. You don't know whether to trust him, ditch him, or love him.Plus, we get Penryn's mother and all her mentally disturbed self, who is this wild addition to the story that is so interesting that she totally works for the storyline. Penryn's relationship and reference to her is unique, heart-breaking, and humorous, all at the same time. I have so many questions about her and know there is so much more to her.There are also other very interesting secondary characters that added so much to the story (like the twins - loved them).By the end Angelfall, I was completely absorbed in this story, getting some of my questions answered but then having just as many new ones pop up. But not in that annoying way. It's in the way that I really appreciate that the author is taking the reader on a unique experience and I can't help but fear and anticipate what will come next. The ending was quite the ride and I'm so glad I already have the next book (but the third isn't out yet, so I might be kicking myself later).Admittedly, I am picky about my &#34;angel&#34; reads and don't tend to read a lot of them. I believe in angels and demons and worry about what direction and interpretation the author will take, particularly when it comes to angels. Now, while I don't know the ultimate outcome of this proposed five-book series, so far with Angelfall I am completely intrigued by the plot and suspense on what exactly is going on behind the scenes of this world and &#34;end of days,&#34; and can't wait to continue with this series.

It felt that scenes were dragged on and on and on, serving no real purpose one way or another. There were plenty of chapters I started and just knew I was going to have to brave through it, only to find nothing for it in the end.2) The writing is lovely. The author knows how to make a sentence pretty but when you pair it with the above part, it's an endless description of someone and their clock making (maybe some people like that). I understand the circus is supposedly the `main character'. That doesn't excuse how boring its construction came across to me. There is also the matter of being too flowery (and switching verb tenses) and I had to focus to untangle what one particular sentence meant.3) Main characters fell flat. Marcus seemed like a guy who just ran after the next sparkly thing that caught his eyes. I had no sympathy for him, had no understanding of his professed `love' for the main girl, and felt he manipulated too many people without the redeeming qualities necessary for me to like him.The main girl was equally not worth my time. I was more confused as to her personality than annoyed/disliking her. So, it's no surprise I didn't care about their interest in one another or where it went. The only characters I found interesting were the twins, who I thought had stronger personalities and voices than anyone else.Neither of the characters seem to care much for the competition they're forced into. It shows. It makes me not care if they have nothing to lose. Anything at ""stake"" (if it could be labeled as that) comes far too late after a random character is thrown into the mix.On that note, there are way too many point of view changes. Maybe some people like that. I find it difficult to learn about any one character if the POV changes constantly. I've only seen it executed well in a few epic fantasy novels and this book is no exception.4) The overall `fantasy' elements and plot. I had too many questions about it at the end. It's fine to leave some things open, especially if it's meant to be ambiguous, but I had so many questions about how/why it came together. Things revolving around that just appeared fickle and I couldn't really enjoy the magical qualities when they made me tilt my head too many times.Why does this competition need to take place? This is only one of many `whys' I had. I don't need everything to be answered but when there are loop holes and seemingly no explanation whatsoever, it takes away from the experience.Boring, unlikeable characters, a plot that doesn't get going until the end (sort of), and a bunch of pretty writing that can't be appreciated.

Good? Okay. The Cuckoo's Calling by J.K. Rowling was orignally masqueraded as a excellent debut novel by newcomer Robert Galbraith. In the statement ""debut novel"", critics reveal a bias toward letting some flaws slide and overlooking the less-than0stellar details of the book, while praising the good things it does well. Now that we know Robert Galbraith is not a newcomer, and no less he is the great J.K. Rowling, I think it's time we all looked at it through the lens of a regular critique: that this is the third outing of a well-known author... and it is also her weakest.The Cuckoo's Calling concerns itself with the apparent suicide of super model Lula Landry, who jumped out of her third floor balcony due to depression. Our detective is Cormoran Strike, a one-legged veteran-turned-private-eye, who finds himself randomly teamed up with a young woman named Robin, who was sent over by a temp service that he forgot to cancel. After receiving the assignment from a worried brother of Lula's, the two hit the streets of London to find out what actually happened the night the model died.The plot is surprisingly feeble, especially for a murder mystery. From the first few pages of the novel, there isn't anything particularly gripping or suspenseful about what is going to happen. You know two things from the get-go: there is a mystery and we will get a resolution eventually. There never was a ""how are we going to figure this out?"" or ""what will we do if we can't?"" moment-- Strike lines up a list of suspects and witnesses and goes through them, one by one, for 400 pages. Each suspect lasts one to two chapters, they tell there side of the story, and then Strike moves. Absolutely no clues are given to the reader during this time, and then somewhere around page 400, a surge of true information comes out and then the book is neatly wrapped up. This makes the plot structure very weird, like one long expository flatline and then a huge drop of a sudden resolution.But despite the plot, the writing in here is superb. It's what you'd expect from the first person to make a billion dollars writing books. The writing is tight, clean, and clinical at times, matching the investigative nature of the story. At first, this may seem a little jarring, and hard to get in to. A few of the paragraphs do tend to go on a sentence fragment or two too long. But the writing does it's job, never gets in the way of the story, and pulls the reader along the way... even if the plot doesn't.The dialogue in this book is phenomenal, easily one of it's strongest points. Each line of each character's speech is carefully written, hand picked to reflect their background, their views, and their characteristics. It is truly a treat to visit each and every witness or suspect and get their side of the story, even if that story isn't compelling. From Tansy Bestigui to Guy Som&eacute;, each character has distinctive speech patterns, a feat which does not go unnoticed after working through each of the novel's 40 or so characters. Sometimes the author even writes in Dialect, which goes well in every case except for one particular one (Lula Landry's birth mother, who's cockney drawl was a headache to read and interpret, especially for an American).After sifting through the various things this book has to offer, you finally get to the end. Many readers and reviews before me have praised this part of the book, but in my opinion, it was nothing special. The loose ends get tied up in a satisfactory way, but nothing shocking or surprising really happens, and, in truth, some of the motives for one specific character get a little murky and quite silly. Of the eight hundred million things that are clarified and revealed to the reader in the final forty pages, only one of them managed to actually surprise me, and it wasn't the ""oh dang!"" moment I was expecting from a mystery with this many high reviews.I'm not sure if my opinion on this book is going to change your mind over whether or not you read it. I mean, come on, it's JK Rowling, it's the talk of the month. You're going to read it. But I hope that my points inspired some thought in you over whether or not you enjoyed this book. As for me? I'm surprised this is the one all the hubbub is about. Personally, I thoughtThe Casual Vacancywas a much better book with a way more solid ending.

However, in the genres that I typically love, I have also read some books I haven't liked, so I had to give this genre another chance. The summary for HOPELESS had me thinking this would be a good one to try.When I started this book, I immediately thought, Oh no, here we go again! The issues I had with the other book I'd read in this genre were in the forefront of this book too, and I assumed I wasn't going to like it at all. In fact, I almost gave up on it. But because I was reviewing it for the blog, I decided to read a little bit more before giving up completely. Boy, am I glad I did! Once I got further into the book, it was nothing like my other experience with New Adult and I couldn't put it down! Let me tell you why...Colleen Hoover has an incredible talent with character development. The complex characters in HOPELESS have unbelievable stories to tell. Their past and present are very intriguing, and with the details Hoover uses in her writing, I was really able to get to know them all intimately.When first introduced to Sky, she was difficult to like. The book was written from her point of view, and her thoughts and feelings were well developed throughout the story, but she seemed to lack self-confidence. She allowed people to think things about her that weren't true and didn't stick up for herself. This was hard for me to relate to. However, her sense of humor started to take over. Then, she went on a journey of rediscovery and it became hard not to fall completely in love with her! In this journey, she started to see herself differently and experienced many firsts as she found herself and a new love.Dean Holder (who goes by Holder) was the handsome, dark, and mysterious hero. He was NOT your typical eighteen-year-old! He has had an emotional past that causes his temper to flare. When his temper was in check, he was an incredible young man. Hoover created a passionate, thoughtful character in Holder, and he proved himself time and time again throughout the story. It became apparent why he had a temper, but at the same time, I related to his soft side and understood why he could be the complete opposite--a young man in control of his emotions and capable of so much love!Sky and Holder had issues that needed to be dealt with, as did the secondary characters, which added to the depth of the story. Sky's mom, Brenda, and her best friend, Six, each bring different elements to the plot that helped me see the main characters fully. These characters are going to stay with me for a long time, and I have already started reading LOSING HOPE, the second book in this series, because I wanted more of Sky and Holder! Speaking of more, I am thrilled to be getting it, as both books have been optioned for film. I am not going to miss them!As much as I disliked how the book started, it actually led to absolute brilliance! I loved how everything came together in the end. Hoover couldn't have surprised me more with her plotting. The story was driven by a timeline that was mostly in the present, but took some important glimpses into the past. The cadence created by these visits between the past and present was excellent. It was what got me excited to continue to turn the pages to learn more. I also loved how the story involved suspense. I kept wondering what all of the details meant; meanwhile, Hoover would introduce another element that would get me one step closer to the clarity desired. As one of my fellow bloggers says, it was amazeballs!I loved the symbolism utilized throughout the book. It added such a nice touch to this beautiful story of young love and self-discovery! I was thankful for the journey Hoover took me on to understand why there is such a sense of hopelessness for everyone involved. And finally, I loved how she concluded the journey with incredible discoveries.I am so thankful I didn't give up on this one early on just because I had a bad experience with a different New Adult book. HOPELESS ended up being nothing like my former read. Instead, it gave me a fresh perspective on this genre that will keep me hoping for more just like it. As a matter of fact, HOPELESS may rank up there as one of my top reads of 2013!BOTTOM LINEHOPELESS is a journey into self-discovery and young love with a beautifully characterized heroine and hero. If you are like me and haven't enjoyed the New Adult genre in the past, this one may change your mind. It is a beautiful romantic and suspenseful story that had me turning the pages to get the clarity I needed to fully understand these amazing characters.RATING: A ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(4712, 4726)",1,0.0,False

As you read it you will realize why and it will blow you away. I agree with the readers that from the very beginning this book grabs you and does not let go. After I finished the story I re-read it to study the minute nuances because it is such a haunting tale. It is a story about relationships in the south at the beginning of the civil rights movement. Not just relationships between white women and their black help, but also about relationships between white women and their husbands, white women with each other, white women and their mothers from another generation, black women and each other, black women and the white children they raised and so much more. To only have seen the one relationship between white women vs the black help is to have missed out on many of the lessons taught within these pages.The plot of the story is about a young white woman, Miss Skeeter, who realizes that to fulfill her dream of becoming a writer, she must dig deeper within herself and write about what matters to her. She decides to write a book about the relationships between white women and their black female helpers as a way to better understand the love she felt for her own helper, Constantine who had abandoned her under mysterious circumstances. With clandestine meetings with her best friends' helpers she is able to interview a dozen other black women employed by white families and learns of stories both good and bad. I admire the author for not writing in graphic detail any sort of absolute acts of injustice or inhumanity such as rape and police brutality, which of course did frequently take place in those times. It is in the consistent subtle mistreatment which causes the most harm and it is also the small kind gestures that have the strongest ability to heal one's soul and shine the brightest.Regardless of whether or not you think the writing is bad, this is a story that needs to be told. To think about who the President of the United States is today emphasizes just how important this story is. The story reminds us of where we were and the kind of progress and transformation this nation has made that would've made the characters of this book paralyzed with shock. Some with joy and some with horror. Recognizing this progress gives even more hope to the leaps and bounds possible for our children's future. The accessibility of this story outweighs any criticism I have for the actual writing and character development. There were times that I found the book to be predictable as another reviewer mentioned, but that is where the importance lies, in the remembering and not in the discovery. After all, this is historical fiction. This book opens up a dialogue that many of us are no longer having but desperately need. The evidence of this point is illustrated by the number of those who gave it 1 star vs those who gave it 5.Needless to say, I highly recommend this book.

By the time this magical circus truly begins in the story, you won't be able to tear yourself away from the enchanting qualities it holds as well as the build up to the surprising conclusion. Each different tent displays creative and unique attractions (I loved the cloud-like one). The circus was, without a doubt, one of my favorite parts. The plot moves slowly, and time is taken to appreciate the details with plenty of description. Readers who love descriptive stories will enjoy this for how easy to visualize it is.HIGHLIGHTS: I could have read this book for weeks. I would have gladly read double the page count. Morgenstern's story is enchanting and she has written a wondrously magical circus that I wish I could visit. I also never quite knew where everything was leading to right away, which is enjoyable for a reader like me. I absolutely adored Poppet, Widget and Bailey's characters (along with their stories).LOWLIGHTS: At times, the magic overtook the novel, and the more ""meaningful"" moments between characters just didn't impress in comparison. Imaginatively, this story rocked, but it lacked emotionally. I didn't know the main characters, Celia and Marco, well enough to enjoy them or believe their ""love"" for each other - I couldn't see the connection. Another issue is that the date jumps around too much to keep things straight, and the ending was also a bit unclear regarding what happened with Celia & Marco.NOTE: There's really only one ""romance"" scene (nothing too descriptive), and because of that, this story has YA crossover potential for older YA readers.

It has the same mechanical plot development as usual but the premise is interesting, being based on the work of Dante. With settings in Venice and Florence, references to ""Moonraker"" (where Bond throws the bad guy through a Venetian clock) and a famous painting of Dante thrown in, and many many more, this is crammed full of thoroughly-researched aspects of Italy, Italian culture, evil plots to destroy the world and modern science.Thorough research is one thing, but Brown is one of those writers who has to show you all the research he did, and that, in addition to the way he frequently stumbles down winding side alleys of unnecessary thought-associations, make the book a little wearying, now and again.That said, the strange similes, the show-off piling on of irrelevant detail have always been part of Brown's repertoire, without greatly harming the volume of his sales. So you can't exactly blame Brown for giving his readers what they want, can you?Robert Langdon's new female assistant bears some remarkable similarities to the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, a leather-wearing, sassy, spiky haired chick with attitude and an itchy trigger finger. But that's either coincidence or a sign that such heroines are a dime a dozen these days.Even if it is a hokey kind of plot, Brown's new book has some interesting, forward-looking elements, and so you keep turning the pages. It may not be especially intelligent or eye-opening, but it does entertain you when you're in that lazy, hazy mood for unchallenging, easy reading.So I would recommend this to all Brown fans - this is a return to form and the standards he set in his finest works.

Needless to say, I was 100% certain when the villain does something dumb that shows him to be the bad guy... and no one catches on.  Not surprisingly, I had also been able to warrant a very good guess as to what happened with Harriet.I found the character of Blomkvist kind of a drag.  It's hard to pull for someone who is so BLAH.  He ruined his marriage by continuing to sleep with Erica, but I'm never sure WHY.  She's married, it is clearly NOT the great love of his life, and they have little to no real chemistry.  The 'relationship' seems forced, and to be honest it skeeved me out that she would tell her husband when she was going to sleep with Blumkvist.  Eww.Blumkvist is totally dense and doesn't pick up HUGE clues about what happened with Harriet, even though it's pretty obvious who the bad guy was, and the answer to what happened to her (without the details of how) is there the entire time.  The answer is so ridiculously in your face, you almost feel let down when it turns out to be what you always knew it was.  I figured with the reviews here, the solving of the crime must pack quite a punch!  I was wrong.To top it all off, the writer makes sure to let us know that, on top of being a bad husband & an idiot, Blumkvist is also a crap parent. Woo woo, what a hero.  He's an idiot who will (LITERALLY) sleep with anyone and has no emotional depth.  WHY were we supposed to be rooting for him??Salander was (obviously) the more interesting character here.

Lisabeth should have been the main character and the entirety of the book should have been told from her perspective.  Of course, had that happened, the book would have been about 200 pages long... because Lisabeth would have figured it out PRONTO.The writer used the dumber character to try and slow down the 'climax' of the (paper thin) story.

Very satisfying sequel, but makes you wonder how one book can finish it all up. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1810, 1824)",1,0.0,False

The story is simple: girl gets shipped off to boarding school in France, makes new friend, meets a hot guy, and falls in lust with him. But there is so much more to it. The characters become real in the course of the 372 pages, as does the incredible Paris setting. I've never been to Paris myself, but after reading this, it's as if I've seen the sights, smelled the city, and tasted the food. Stephanie Perkins brings that much life to Anna's Paris.And to Anna as well. This is one girl I could not only relate to, but who I wholeheartedly loved. I adore Anna. She's funny, insecure, hilarious, flawed, angry, happy, sad, hormonal (obviously, as I list her emotions here...), and a teen girl. She's a character that could easily be any girl I pass on the street. Oh, and I love her. I love &Eacute;tienne St. Clair too, because I couldn't leave him out. He's as realistic as Anna, with is insecurities, his sweet gestures, and stupid actions. And his British accent and all-around gorgeousness.  That's the reason that Anna and the French Kiss is so easy to enjoy (not the gorgeousness, but a plus!); it's the characters. The characters, both big and small - no offense to the short &Eacute;tienne - are developed so thoroughly that they all leap off the page.The relationships between Anna and &Eacute;tienne, between &Eacute;tienne and Josh, between Anna and Meredith (I could go on, but I'll stop) all evolve throughout the book. Perkins' witty humor comes out on every page and the dialogue is sharp and quick. The book is cute, I can't lie about that, but it's not 'ooey-gooey, poke-out-your-eyeballs' cute. This is `melt into a puddle, I-want-to-live-in-you-forever,' kind of cute. It's a love story that doesn't just focus on the love. There's tension between Anna and &Eacute;tienne - and it's some yummy tension - but they start as friends and build from there. Not only that, but the two of them have issues outside of their little `I like you, do you like me?' bubble.Anna and the French Kiss is impossible to dislike, unless you are soulless and possibly a kitty murderer. It's sweet and real and fantastically written, with a cast of characters that you'll want to meet, know, and be BFFs with. I smiled a lot while reading it; one of those cheesy grins of pure joy. I read it one sitting because I couldn't put it down, even though I wanted to. Much like a meal in Paris, Anna and the French Kiss is a book to be savored, but is still so easily devoured. As I read the last line, I let out a sigh of pure bliss. A sigh!? That alone should make you pick this book up. Right now. What are you waiting for? GO.

For those in the sciences it is well known that a thesis is only as good as the data collected; and much of the authors data is from small sample sizes they go on the claim as irrefutable law (most contentious is the abortion and the crime rate correlation from the 1st book), which makes their hypothesis always...questionable; and for those critical of the Freakonimics series is their main argument against them.In the end the book does what they probably intend, makes economics a philosophy relevant for the masses again. This book presents people with material for conversation and debate after dinner with friends and family.

The human body now serves as a ""host"" to unseen invaders from another life form.  These invaders plan to take over and make the earth a more civilized place, and it won't be tainted by things like war, sexual perversity, hatred and other human complexities.  ""Wanderer"" invades the body of Melanie Stryder.  It should be simple enough.  At first, the Wanderer will experience some withdrawal, where the former soul refuses to succumb and the invader experiences thoughts and memories that are not her own.  But as Wanderer goes on with her life and career, she realizes that Melanie lives within her, tormenting her thoughts.  The reason to the host's refusal to move on dawns on Wanderer: Melanie is looking out for two humans, one of whom is the love of her life.  Things reach a head, and Wanderer can no longer distinguish between her thoughts and Melanie's, and soon their feelings for Jared are in synch as well.  How will it all unfold?Stephenie Meyer once said that she was a better storyteller than she was a writer.  I think I get what she means after reading this book.  I bought this a year ago, began to read it, then put it down after about one hundred pages.  Now I dust it off, open it to the dog-eared page, and carry on reading it.  I didn't have to reread the first hundred pages, for it was not difficult to pick it up where I'd left it off.  The first two hundred or so pages are extremely dull.  It is nothing more than a series of flashbacks and Wanderer having an internal dialogue with Melanie.  Things pick up after this rather tedious beginning.  However, things drag on and on to a point where I almost throw the book to the nearest wall in more than one occasion.  This book should have been at least two hundred pages shorter.  The redundancy is extremely exhausting.  Science fiction has never been my favorite genre.  I cannot imagine green-colored men and aliens with six or seven eyes that are found in those books.  (I do like paranormal fantasy though, which is why I enjoyed Meyer's Twilight series better.)  However, this one is entertaining and at times compelling.  If only it had been better written and edited.  But oh well.  I needed to know why this book was so popular (still in hardback and an NYT bestseller after over one year), and so that's out of the way.  Read it if you must.

You two are a disaster.""I smiled at the ceiling.  ""It doesn't matter what or why it is.  When it's good, Kara...it's beautiful.""This quote describes Beautiful Disaster perfectly!  I had read a couple of good reviews about this book and when I saw Beautiful Disaster on NetGalley a couple of weeks ago, I decided to get it and planned to squeeze it my reading list sometime in the next couple of months.  But after reading a particular review by Debbie  at I Heart YA Books, I just simply had to put all of my other books aside and I HAD to read it right away!  I started reading this book around 11:30pm and I stayed up until 2:30am reading half of the book (even though I had to wake up at 5:30 the next morning) and finishing the whole thing the next night.  So yes, this book was simply unputdownable. (Is that a word?)Let me start off by saying that this book is not perfect and at times it was a bit of a disaster but that's why I loved it so much.  Travis and Abby were two very flawed characters with a lot of issues to work through.  For some reason these always become my favorite types of characters.  To me, it makes it even more special to see them grow and change and I feel like the payoff is even bigger at the end.  I know a lot of people really didn't like Travis but I absolutely and completely LOVED him, everything about him!  The good and the bad.  Yes, he can be a jerk and he has one hell of a temper and some major jealousy issues but all of these flaws just made him even more realistic to me.  Don't worry because he doesn't stay that way throughout the whole book.  Once he meets Abby he slowly starts changing, sometimes for the better, sometimes not.  But the important thing to me is that he tries to be a better person for Abby.  There is another character in this book, Parker, who is somewhat a love interest to Abby.  He was pretty much perfect:  good looking, rich, nice, good manners, Harvard-bound...and I absolutely could not stand him!  He was such a bore.  Maybe it's just me and maybe I'm not right in the head but I like reading about the messed up characters.  The more screwed up they are, the better I like them.  (Most of the time)Abby was a very complex character.  She has a shady past and has worked hard to move on from it.  But from the moment she meets Travis, she can't help but feel drawn to him.  Don't worry; this isn't one of those insta-love stories.  In fact, it's the completely opposite.  It's one of those almostexcruciating but awesome slow build-ups that pushes them together one moment only to have them ripped apart the next.  Abby and Travis have such a complicated and messed up friendship and their relationship is even more messed up.  Just like the quote above says, when things are good between them it was such a beautiful thing.  But when things went bad, it was definitely disastrous.  At first, I really liked Abby because she was really tough and she would stand up to herself to Travis and didn't take any of his bullshit.  But the closer they got, and the more blurry the line between friendship and romance got, she did some very stupid things which made me want to reach into the book and slap her a couple of times. (Maybe more than a couple)It's official!  I found my new favorite category:  New Adult!  I mostly read YA (hence the blog name) and as much as I love them I sometimes feel like there is something missing.  Well I found out what that was: sex!  This is another thing that adds a realistic element to the story.  I don't know why but it always bugs me when couples in YA wait until the third book to finally have sex.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not against waiting and I definitely love the sexual tension until then, but what is it about the third book that makes it ok then?  The relationship between Travis and Abby is scorching hot without being graphic or inappropriate.  It's also such a refreshing change to move away from the high school setting (and drama).  All of these things including the language make it so much more real to me.The plot definitely took a couple of crazy turns but overall, I absolutely fell in love with this book!  The only thing that I didn't like about the book was that Travis has this nickname for Abby: Pigeon or Pidge.  It briefly gets explained why he gave her that nickname although it didn't really make sense (to me).  I mentally programmed my brain to just read `Abby"" every time the word Pigeon came out.  I also loved Shepley and America who are Travis and Abby's best friends (and also a couple). Travis and Abby are one of my new favorite couples and Beautiful Disaster has made it into my top 10 all-time favorite books.  I read on the author's blog that she is writing a companion to this book, Walking Disaster which is basically this story but told from Travis's POV!  Travis has some serious issues and I can't wait to get inside his head.  Counting down the days until we get to read a new perspective on Travis on Abby.Due to the content and language of this book, it is recommended for ages 17+. (New Adult)  Beautiful Disaster is not for everyone.  I have seen some pretty harsh reviews for this book and it looks like it's one of those books you are either gonna LOVE or HATE.  It's raw and intense and very emotional and it tackles some pretty serious issues.  Whether you love it or not, one thing is clear:  everyone is talking about Beautiful Disaster!  Read it and make up your own decision about it instead of staying away from it because of the bad reviews.5 out of 5 very sparkly stars!!!  A MUST-read!Some of my favorite non-spoiler quotes from Beautiful Disaster:-""You're only making it worse by brushing him off.  He's not used to that.""""What do you suggest I do?  Sleep with him?""America shrugged.  ""It'll save time.""-He leaned in close and whispered in my ear.  ""I don't wanna sleep with you, Pidge. I like you too much.""He walked past me to the bathroom, and I stood, stunned.Kara's words replayed in my mind.  Travis Maddox slept with everyone; I couldn't help but feel deficient in some way knowing he had no desire to even try to sleep with me.-I clinked my bottle against his.  ""To being the only girl a guy with no standards doesn't want to sleep with."" I said, taking a swig.""Are you serious?"" he asked, pulling the bottle from my mouth.  When I didn't recant, he leaned toward me.  ""First of all...I have standards.  I've never been with an ugly woman.  Ever.  Second of all, I wanted to sleep with you.  I thought about throwing you over my couch fifty different ways, but I haven't because I don't see you that way anymore.  It's not that I'm not attracted to you, I just think you're better than that.""-""Abs?"" What are you a workout video?"" he sneered.""Pigeon?"" I said with the same amount of disdain.  ""An annoying bird that craps all over the sidewalk?""-I yanked his shirt over his head, fumbling in the dark with his belt buckle.  He jerked it open, ripped it off, and threw it on the floor.  He lifted me from the mattress with one hand and unzipped my dress with the other.  I pulled it over my head, tossing it somewhere in the dark, and then Travis kissed me, moaning against my mouth.***Read more of my reviews at:Nereyda @Mostly YA Book Obsessed ANSWERNOTFOUND","was a bit of a disaster but that's why I loved it so much.

I have the first three books of the Twilight series and I will admit that I am not really a fan of them.  The writing in those books is not very well done, plus I have problems with the storyline and the characters in general.  Plus with all the hype surrounding them, it just makes the reading seem more tedious.  Therefore I approached The Host with rather low expectations and prepared myself for another Twilight except with aliens.  Boy was I in for a shocker.When I started reading, I was amazed at how I got sucked into the book.  I really didn't expect to, because my experiences at reading Twilight had been more like let's get the book over with quickly.  This time I found myself drawn into the story, wanting to savor every word. I didn't speed through this book like I normally would, instead I read the book in snippets every day.  It's not the type of book to rush through as it pull you in and you find yourself engrossed into the story. I found the storyline very interesting and I'm not a sci-fi or fantasy fan at all.  The invasion of aliens on Earth, the takeover of human bodies as hosts and the struggle for the remaining humans for survival was believable and not done in a cheesy sort of way.  It's a plot that one could see actually happening and the underground network of humans very much like a bomb shelterplot line.The relationship between Wanda and Melanie is very unique because it's like having a two headed monster, without the second head.  At first Wanda is kind of unlikable because she isdoing things the way her species is used to, by taking control of everything with no regard for their human hosts. However as the story progresses she soon learns more about the human species and even falls in love with one of them.  The whole love triangle bit was a bit weird and took a while to comprehend, but it's written very well.  It's more developed dare I say than the Bella/Edward/Jacob storyline.There are just two qualms I have with this book. The first is that I didn't really like the way of how both Melanie's and Wanda's thoughts are in the same italicized font. It would have been better if Melanie's thoughts had just been italicized or if Wanda's had been put in a different font. As it stands, it gets confusing when the two are ""talking"" to each other and there's no distinction between the two voices.  My other qualm was that I felt the ending to be rather disappointing. I felt that the story had built up to an intense level and then just dropped off. I'm not sure if this is because there is going to be a sequel to the book or what, but it felt like a cop out at the end of the story.Still I will say that I really enjoyed reading this book. For a change it wasn't a fast read for me. Instead I had a savor it, a little bit at a time each day. Thus it took me longer to finish this book than I normally would. However, I felt that this was the best way to read the book as it's not one to devour in a span of a few hours.

Given these circumstances, I'll cut right to the chase. This is a terrific book, and it is apparently just the first of six that will make up the entire ""Fire And Ice"" series.Tolkien is the standard by which I measure adult fantasy and, while my experience in this genre is limited, ""A Game Of Thrones"" is the most compelling and well-conceived tale I've found since Tolkien (and I liked Kay's ""Tigana"" and Brooks' Shannara books very much). It lacks Tolkien's deft touch of humor, but the plotting is intricate and multi-faceted and the characters have real depth, with elements of both good and bad in their personalities. Some are at once likeable but on the wrong side, and vice versa. Further, the ""good guys"" in this story are just as much at risk as the ""bad guys"". Death can strike down anyone, and it sometimes does so with stunning suddenness.The plotting is truly fascinating. Most immediately, the political and personal intrigue within the seven kingdoms is fast-moving and treacherous. But, beyond that, there is the Princess Daenerys, the last suviving member of the previous ruling house of the Seven Kingdoms, who dreams of returning from exile and reclaiming the throne for herself. Lurking beyond even that, however, is the ominous threat that ""winter is coming"". The great northern ice wall separates the Seven Kingdoms from a vague danger that is, as yet, only hinted at but which seems to be perhaps the greatest danger of all.This is great storytelling. A real page-turner. There's never a dull moment and, as a reader, I was always anxious to see what was going to happen next. I have the next book (#2), but book #3 doesn't come out in paperback for a couple of months and the remaining books in the series are farther down the line.

Having finished this book in four days, I found myself often getting upset at the irresponsible, self-centered attitude Harry has developed (anyone who dares to yell at Dumbledore deserves to get the Crucio curse). Sure, it was to show a troubled adolescence all the more twisted by having to fight evil dudes at every turn. Still, a lot of times I wished someone would just give Harry the beating he never got. At the same time, the familiar wit and jokes we've gotten used to in the series is present, so faithfuls will find it easy to get into. Lots of teasers, something always happening... but we have this very disturbed version of Harry. Hopefully he grows up in the next two books and avoids becoming like his father.One thing that this book manages to avoid is the repetitious introduction of the main characters, which the previous books dedicated a significant amount to. Book Five simply jumps right into the plot, assuming the readers are almost familiar with everyone.Potter fans will definitely like this book. Just be prepared for a new Harry.

Second, I would advise you not to read the full synopsis of this novel before reading it--just know the basic plot and you're all set, unless you don't mind having it spoiled for you.Anyway, on to the review:My expectations for Room were very high, but at the same time I was a little worried about a novel with a 5-year-old narrator. While this was partly what attracted me to the book, I thought it might be difficult to both convey enough information and still have the narrator really seem 5 years old. But ultimately, I think that Donoghue handled this wonderfully. Jack is a superb narrator and I do not think that this novel could have been told from any other point of view. His perspective is so unique, and while he may be a bit more descriptive than the average child, I did not have a problem believing that he was so young. Certain aspects of the novel do seem oversimplified, though: some things work out too easily, and others just aren't as complicated as they should be. But I don't think there is very much that Donoghue could have done to explain these while staying in Jack's perspective; Jack couldn't understand everything that was going on--and indeed, much of the novel focuses on Jack's totally skewed perception of the world, resulting from growing up in the Room and from what his Ma told him. It's heartbreaking but very interesting to see how Jack perceives the world. To that end, I loved how much detail Donoghue included regarding Jack's perceptions and the various aspects of the world that he did not know or did not understand. I think she thought of many things that I would have never considered, like the fact that at age five Jack has never worn shoes before because there is no reason to within the confines of the Room.I did find the middle of the book kind of boring. While I didn't have any trouble getting through it, that chunk of the book just doesn't stand out to me. And in fact, while I enjoyed Jack's narration and reading everything that happens to him and his Ma, I guess I was expecting more. I can't say that I was really disappointed, but I will say that I didn't love Room as much as I expected to, nor was it the emotional roller coaster I anticipated (I feel like it moved too quickly to be extremely emotional). I really, really wanted to love this book. I wanted it to shred me up then piece me back together. But my expectations were too high. It was very interesting and compelling, with a fascinating premise, and I do consider it a worthwhile read, but it was not quite what I expected.

Most of the remaining story takes place inside a special facility a short drive from Chicago, where we find out what the story is about Chicago and the factions, as well as what it really means to be divergent.  Three-quarters of the way into this story, I was very disappointed.  It felt like the author was just going through the motions, and frankly, the story was boring and dull--lots of talking and philosophical introspection, but not much plot movement.  The last quarter of the book salvaged things for me and raised the story from one star to 3.5.  No, like a thousand others, I didn't like the ending, and I didn't think the ending was necessitated in any way by the story arc.  It seemed almost as if the author realized the story about to crash and burn, so she tossed in this ending to slap us in the face.  HOWEVER, the ending was well done and beautifully written, and it was quite evocative.  I thought the writing went from passable and average to excellent and gripping.  BUT, I'm only at 3.5 stars because the ending doesn't really fit the overall trilogy IMO.  So, for those that want a 'they all lived happily ever after' ending, don't read this book.  Stop with Insurgent and think up your own ending.  For those of you, who--like Tris--aren't afraid to jump off the roof into the net below, you should read it and experience the pain.

Lisa Renee Jones is a brilliant author that knows just how to draw a reader in on the first page of her book and keep a hold of them long after the book is over.  If I Were You is by far the best book I have read so far this year and I have read a lot of books.  I read books about love and romance and books that are erotic but there is nothing out there quite like this book.  This isn't just a book about dominant male men and sex this books is all full of suspense and leaves you guessing even after the book is over.  There are very few authors that can keep you glued to a chair for eight hours straight but this has author has done that to me.  I started reading If I Were You today at about 1 pm by 9 pm I was done the only time I got up was to use the bathroom and once to get something to eat that hasn't even happened to me before.  I am still having withdrawals from the book and I finished the book four hours ago and yet the cliffhanger at the end of the book still has me wondering what will happen next to Sara and has me still wondering about Rebecca and her journals.This book has been on my to read list since I bought it a few months back but I was asked to do a feature of this author and a review so I picked it up and started reading it expecting to find what so many books have in common simple characters and sex.  Don't get me wrong this book has some incredibly hot scenes in it and there's nothing wrong with a book that is primarily about sex, but this book was so much more than that.  At the beginning of the book is a journal entry from that moment on I was hooked it seemed to me that the journal entry was being written by that person at that very moment to my surprise it wasn't being written then but being read my the main character in this book Sara McMillan a high school English teacher and the journal was left by her next door neighbor Ella the night before who wants the journal back so she and her boyfriend can read it.  The reader learns that Ella got the journal from a storage unit auction after getting hooked on the TV show Storage Wars and that the locker is full of paintings and other personal items.  Ella ends up running off the elope with her new boyfriend and leaves Sara with the key to the storage unit telling her she can take everything that is in it and sell its contents and keep the profit.  When Sara goes to the unit she discovers three additional journals, a locked box, and a storage full of paintings and other personal items discovering that the owner of the unit one Rebecca Mason and discovers a locked box after an employee from the storage place tells her there are always secrets kept in dresser drawers one question the book did leave me with is who was this mysterious and creepy storage worker?  He just gave me this sense that he was either looking for something or has some secret he is hiding I wonder if he'll come up again in one of the other books.During her search through Rebecca's storage unit she also looks for clues in her personal papers to see if she can discover anything that might lead her to Rebecca since she wants to return her items to her since what she's read from the journal is so personal and she doesn't feel right keeping it or selling this woman's personal belongings.  In her search she finds that Rebecca works at an art gallery there is San Francisco but every time she calls the workers keep telling her that Rebecca is on a personal leave and has not returned.  Sara starts to grow impatient so she finds out that in a few days there is an art showing for a local artist by the name of Ricardo Alvarez so she goes to the showing with the intent of finding out what happened to Rebecca and where she can be found.  Two things happen that night she meets the owner of the gallery Mark Compton and is offered a job since she ends up selling a painting and studied art in college and she also meets Chris Merit the handsome artist that Sara happened to study in college and is a huge fan of.  Mark and Chris are complete different types of men Mark is a dark dominant type and Chris appears to have a much softer sign but with all things looks can be deceiving.  As the story goes on Sara seems to lose herself in Rebecca.  Sara and Rebecca have so many things in common that it's scary.  They both love art and Sara feels like she's living in Rebecca's life filling in for her and working out of her office.  They both fall for the same type of men that want control and power over their women and want to dominate more than anything else.  It was very interesting to see Sara mold and grow into her own person through Rebecca's journal entries and find her own footing in the art world; Sara wants so much to have a career in art and she's finally got her shot.  The relationship that grows between Chris and Sara was very fascinating to me these characters didn't just go through the motions of a relationship these characters grew and evolved as the story progressed and as you get further into the story the secrets start to come out not just with them but also with Mark which left me wondering exactly how much Mark was involved with Rebecca and her 'master' as she referred to him since his name was never mentioned in her journal entries.  Did he have something to do with her disappearance?  Does she know where she is?  Is he the other man that she was shared with?  I cannot wait to find out the answer to these questions.  Then there was Chris and his secrets from that first time he and Sara have sex from that moment it becomes clear that the image that was painted of Chris as a person is completely different from this dominate dark man who has her pressed up against the glass wall of his apartment which was HOTT.  Chris has a lot of secrets and demons that he is dealing with and he keeps telling Sara that she should stay away from him that she will run away from him eventually but I hope she doesn't because despite his secrets I truly did love the character Chris and I can't wait to read more about him.The characters in this book were incredibly depicted and I thoroughly enjoyed this book I cannot wait to read the other books in this series as well as the journals.  This was by far one of the best books I have ever read and didn't bore me even for one second I think everyone should read this book it had a little bit of everything and will only leave you wanting more of Chris and Sara.

In the not-too-distant future, a virus has destroyed fertility in adults, so the wombs of teen girls ignite bidding wars, getting pregnant is encouraged and glamorized, contraception of any kind is forbidden. Even though it's squeegy, I could actually see this occurring, burdoning young fertile ones to give their all for their country, for the world. Unfortunately, the concept is the only thing the story had going for it, while there are so many possibilities and nuances in that scenario that are never explored. I don't understand how books that are all concept and no substance are all the rage. As with WAKE, this novel is fairly popular and well-received, but I just don't get it.BUMPED starts off very telly, with alternating, talky viewpoints that bounce between twin sisters, Melody, the sardonic, cold one, and Harmony, the hyper-religious one, as they introduce us to their dystopian world and contrasting ideologies.Separated at birth, they're acquainting for the first time. Harmony is ecstatic about finding her sister, and Melody is beyond annoyed at her presence. After 20 or thirty pages, you finally get some scenes with dialogue, but everything is still kept sparse with very little description and hardly any sensory impressions that it makes it difficult to SEE or experience this world. The faintest strokes are drawn on every page for two unlikeable, thinly drawn characters. One can see how their different environments have shaped their dispositions, but knowing that doesn't help make them relatable. You never get to really sink into their shoes, feel what they feel and identify. At least I didn't. I didn't feel angry, hurt, sad, gleeful, just blah.In addition to sketchy characters, BUMPED also had no plot. ""For Seriously!"" It's just a window into this teen-preggo world. And the problem with a book without a plot is it has no hook, climax or stakes. It didn't go far, have a purpose or build to anything substantial. The characters did have decisions to make in the end, and they both softened up somewhat about five chapters from the end, but it was way too late to feel vested.The most likeable character in the book is Zen. As with the story WAKE, I liked the random male friend the most. If these MC's didn't have weird names, they'd be totally forgotten, like, tomorrow, and I have photographic memory.Melody, groomed to be the perfect rental space, is under contract to ""bump"" with a stud, and not totally thrilled about her obligation. In contrast, Harmony is not only determined to have a baby rightly through marriage, while enshrined in veils, gloves, long dresses, and more man-made traditions than scriptural ones, she hopes to convert her sister into doing the same. Even though Harmony is the pushy one, at least she's sweet in the beginning, so I softened to her first, but they were both extremely obnoxious within their sturdy mindsets. I think if they'd been given many more layers and the story more complexity, scope and structure, it would've been a more enjoyable read. I also liked seeing a religious character in a book, but she was taken so far over the top into cultish territory that it made her passion just as flawed as her distortions.BUMPED did have a great concept, and it will definitely stir up plenty of conversation on ethics, it just never lived up to its potential.

The Eye of the World, the seminal volume of Robert Jordan's masterpiece epic fantasy series The Wheel of Time, was released on January 15, 1990.  It has long been on my TBR pile, and after Brandon Sanderson took over the helm of the last book, I finally decided to dive into the series.In 1990, fantasy was mostly what I think of as clich&eacute;d.  Dark Lords, prophecies, simple farm boys, and the like stomp through the books of the era, and The Eye of the World contains its fair share of them.  Still, I knew this all going into the book, and I'm a patient reader, willing to give the author many, many pages before I make my decision to abandon a read.  More often than not, I finish a book once I start it, and it's a rare thing indeed if I put one away in disgust.  Still, by the time I finished The Eye of the World, I felt somewhat relieved, somewhat exhilarated, somewhat exhausted, and somewhat interested to find out what happens next.The dramatis personae is enormous for this book, and I imagine can only grow as the series progresses.  Rand al'Thor, Matrim Cauthon and Perrin Aybara are from the Two Rivers, a simple farming village nestled away in the backwater lands of Andor.  They make their lives as simpletons dreaming of adventure and life outside the country vale.  One night, the town is attacked by Trollocs, devastating the unprepared town, and the three lads learn that they were the reason for the attack.  They flee the Two Rivers, hoping to keep their homelands safe, and thus the epic journey begins.Many curious and interesting things happen on the road for the travelers.  More people are joined to their party, and the world slowly unfolds.  The group is hounded by followers of the Shadow, and soon it's obvious that the Dark One must be stopped and that this group is more important than once thought.  Jordan painstakingly describes the scenes, like the master of high fantasy Tolkien himself, long worded and lengthy.  I sometimes found myself zoning out at the language, much like I did when I first discovered The Lord of the Rings.All of this is not to say that The Eye of the World is a bad book.  No, on the contrary, it has plenty to keep the reader excited and thrilled.  The imagination is impressive, crafting a world full of legends and many different cultures and creatures.  The use of magic is never far from belief, and the threat of the Shadow is constantly reminding the reader that the world is not safe.  Plus, some scenes are just plain fun, especially the resolution.Still, the biggest problem with Jordan's opening volume, and the most difficult thing to overcome, is the wordiness.  Jordan has a terrible habit of repeating himself over and over, using the same actions for the same characters.  For one, the characters ""curse"" all the time; saying ""burn me"" or ""blood and ashes"" after every bad thing that happens is just boring and trite.  It's not that I have a problem with the curse words in literature, but I just think they're a bit overused and unrealistic.  In fact, I'd go as far as saying that the dialogue is quite unrealistic more often than not.  Also, not only are the curses re-used over and over, but so are character mannerisms.  Having Tom ""blow out his mustaches"" when he's flustered is okay on occasion, but not every single time.  And the women pulling at their braids or smoothing their skirts?  Bah.Yet, if you can get past the wordiness and the lackluster dialogue, Jordan has a rough gem buried.  The worldbuilding is excellent.  The legends are fascinating.  The tale is truly epic in scope, exploring various themes of what it's like to be chosen as the savior of the world, how the common people react to growing Shadow, and countless others.  Many of the characters in the main party are all interesting for different reasons, and though Rand is the main POV, the insight to other characters is great fun.  (I never really warmed up to Mat, that dork.  Perrin, on the other hand, was cool, and Thom, too.)Overall, The Eye of the World is a long novel that only scratches the surface of the enormous Wheel of Time series.  I've read that the series drops the ball a bit in the middle, and that could prove problematic.  Still, it is a modern classic that must be read by all fans of fantasy, or at least attempted.  However, I already own The Great Hunt, the next book in the series, so I'll probably be starting it at some point in the quasi-near future.  I feel like I need to pace myself between books to keep it up and not get burned out.  In the end, I recommend The Eye of the World to all fans of fantasy, especially in the epic subgenre, but with a warning: be prepared for a great story, but a little work to get to it.

We were both tourists in Sweden and after some small talk she mentioned that she had been living in Dresden during the firebombing of WWII. I tried to press her for details, but it was clear that the mere mention of that event was opening up horrible memories for her and she couldn't bear to talk about it anymore. This was in 1995 -- 50 years after the event.Mockingjay is a remarkable novel, because it brings the reader deep inside the psyche of a person like that woman on the bench. Through Katniss, we are able to see a person transform from a little girl learning about the forest from her father into a woman whose nightmares are almost unbearable, and which will never go away. Most admirable is that this important lesson about the long term cost of warfare, is being directed at a Young Adult readership.The transformation of Katniss felt real, and it felt natural, and it felt like something that was in the plans from the very first pages of this book. I remember that when I first met Haymitch, I found his negative attitude irritating.  By the end of this book, I was left feeling like I could totally understand where he was coming from. In fact, by understanding Katniss, I even found myself finally having a better understanding of what might have driven Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain to suicide in 1994.I am very grateful to Suzanne Collins that she did not make this a story of a little girl transforming into a superhero. War heros are real, but even in the most justified war situation, war heroes leave the battlefield scarred for life. Collins knew this, because her own father was a Vietnam vet who had a lifetime of nightmares to contend with. The best way of honoring these people, like her father, is to depict this depressing reality of the unavoidable cost of war.Reading Katniss's story was so compelling that I found myself able to overlook many of the unsatisfying aspects of this book. My chief problem with these books is that as Katniss ventured further and further from her beautifully depicted home in District 12, the environment she found herself in felt less and less fully realized and more and more contrived. These gripes began in earnest with the second book, and contined with this third book. The biggest offender here is The Capitol, which is described in much more detail than before. I am sure the author has good reasons for why the city planners of The Capitol needed to fill it with booby traps. For me, the place just felt like a silly videogame, which detracted a bit from the very serious drama taking place on the streets of that city. Still, these are minor issues that I found myself able to overlook. It is only because the psychological storylines are so strong that I wish this book's description of environment was as detailed and satisfying as it was in Tolkein's Lord of the Rings, but I realize that this is an unrealistic expectation.I am surprised by the many negative reviews written about this book. So many detractors of this book seem to be let down by the negative tone of this book. It is interesting how these negative reviews contrast so sharply with the near universal praise the book has received from adult book critics. I do think that older readers probably have more personal life experiences to help them appreciate the negative tone of this book. Us older people understand that there are some sad memories that never go away, and that life can be worth living anyways. So, to those young readers depressed by this book, I only implore you not to despair over the fact that Katniss's life didn't turn out as nice as you hoped, but instead take heart in the fact that so many adults have embraced these books. I would venture to say that almost all of us adults who are parents have some dark corners buried in our psyche that can keep us awake at night, but like Katniss we have all found our own ways to cope with the inevitable disappointments that life has thrown us, and for the most part we all eventually find a way to enjoy life despite all the lousy stuff that we have to step through along the way.

While I don't share that particular belief, I found the novel both enjoyable and absorbing.The plot of this novel is nothing groundbreaking.  Carl Blomkvist, a disgraced Swedish journalist, is hired by a wealthy industrialist to solve a 30-year old disappearance.  In order to solve the crime, he eventually teams up with Lisbeth Sander, a young, anti-social computer hacker.  Together, they eventually uncover a dark family web of secrets that may involve a serial killer.The real strength of THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is the characterization.  The late Stieg Larsson does a superb job of creating a set of vivid characters that achieve a level of depth and complexity that you rarely find in genre fiction.  In particular, the personality and background of Lisbeth Sander is quite unique and ultimately quite compelling to read about.I also very much enjoyed the setting of this book.  This novel is written by a Scandinavian author and almost entirely takes place in his native country of Sweden.  As an American who knows virtually nothing about Scandinavia, I found Larsson's descriptions of the Swedish government, business practices,  and societal norms to be quite fascinating.This novel, however, isn't for everyone.  Larsson is a wordy and descriptive writer, and this novel meanders around quite a bit in the middle, with multiple subplots (including a rather pointless romance) that really don't really drive the story forward.  Larsson also sometimes uses more detail than necessary, such as when he describes in excruciating depth how hackers can break into laptop computers.Further, the crime story ends rather prematurely, with Larson devoting his final sixty pages to resolving a subplot involving the main character's professional career that I didn't find particularly interesting.  While I found this book a page turner for the most part, my patience began to wear thin in spots, especially after I was two thirds of the way through.Overall, however, THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is a highly enjoyable read, and I think readers of quality crime fiction will find much to enjoy.  This is definitely one of the better debuts I've read this year, and I'm sad that Larsson passed away before completing this series. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2342, 2356)",1,0.0,False

Halliday, before his death, left a series of puzzles and clues that would lead one lucky player to his fortune. Wade Watts (nee Parzival) wants to be the first to find this treasure, and does find and solve the first of many puzzles. Now the world is watching.

However, a large corporation, IOI, led by a man named Sorrento, also wants to find Halliday's fortune and they've got the firepower and resources to do it.The characters are all likable (with the exception of Sorrento) and the 80s nostalgia is amusing (Halliday codes his puzzles with dialogue from 80s films like 'WarGames').

And from there, a more and more surprising and devious plot develops, cleverly and elegantly put together by a very talented writer.It is difficult to talk about the plot without risking spoilers. So let's say this: It is not a conventional thriller. There are twists and totally surprising developments, we are getting manipulated and are lied to by both protagonists. It's not only a thriller, the book is also about unconventional truths about love and marriage. Sadly, the ending is a disappointment. Best not to expect too much from it and just enjoy the reading of the novel as such.The book is always straightforward and readable, but maybe there are a few digressions too many. I can't help but feeling that nowadays thriller writers feel the need to expand their books to 600 pages when 400 would have done just as well. That's stupid, because it automatically weakens the suspense.Gillian Flynn really deconstructed love and marriage here a lot, so I have a suggestion for readers who would like to read a (shorter) crime novel which is thrilling, full of dark humor and lets you believe in love again:Heads Off (A Lisa Becker Mystery).

I didn't intend to read Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl when I did. Two other books sat on the top of the reading pile, begging for a thorough read, the Amazon reader review thing, and so on. But one dark day, I needed a book with an edge to it, and having peeked at a sample page of Gone Girl already, I knew where to find that edge.Gone Girl is the story of Nick and Amy, a seemingly perfect couple to anyone looking in from the outside. But at the start of the book, on the couple's fifth anniversary, when Nick comes home to a ransacked living room and a missing wife, the marriage has already deteriorated to a far from perfect state. Talk about your love hate relationship. Nick and Amy have one in spades at this point - mostly hate, but with love so excruciatingly painted around the edges you can't imagine a better combination.Nick's clumsy handling of himself during the police investigation and an accumulating, increasingly-damning pile of evidence soon point the finger at him as the murderer. We, the readers, don't know whether he is one or not, even though we've been reading most passages from his first person point of view.So is he or isn't he? I won't spoil it. Let me instead touch on two compelling aspects of this novel. First, Gillian's voice is one that many writers would kill for (bad pun, I know). Through the first half of the book she alternates her passages from Nick's point of view (written in a Jess Walter voice, and you never think for one second that hmmm this is a woman trying to write from a man's POV), and Amy's point of view as found in diary entries written before the climactic murder or abduction or whatever actually happened (because I still refuse to tell). Amy's voice is much different than Nick's and I love that. She's brilliant and has a fascinating perceptiveness about each of those many people who just can't help but revolve around her irresistible gravitational force.The other can't-put-it-down aspect of this novel is the quick pacing both before and after a sudden switch in plot halfway through. By that point, as a reader, you think you know the whole story and how it will all end, and you can't imagine what the second half of the book will be for.  Why isn't this a novella? What's coming next?What's coming next is motive, and true circumstances, plans going awry, plans being reshaped, and a remarkable elevation of compromise to an art form.I loved this book.Joe ANSWERNOTFOUND",Amazon,"(152, 158)",2,0.0,False

The thesis of this book, split into 40 chapters, one to be read in daily succession (or as I'd recommend, to be listened to---as I found the audio version to be more suited for such a task) is that you should ""make learning to love the goal of your life.""  Relationships are what life is all about.  Working like mad now so as to be, perhaps, lazy in retirement ought not be one's mission, because the ""best expression of love is time;"" because ""your time IS your life"" (emphasis added), & to sacrafice it for some hoped for retirement is but a fool's gamble.  You ought instead---and such advice is spelled out on individual days of the 40---cultivate community & commit yourself to others.  You ought refuse to listen to (or engage in) gossip, and you ought make it a point to encourage others rather than simply finding faults in others.  ""Life is supposed to be difficult,"" after all.. ""It's what enables us to grow.""  Our author herein, Rick Warren, argues in support of such that ""Christianity is not a religion or a philosophy, but a relationship and a lifestyle""  & ""the core of that lifestyle is thinking of others.""  So remember that pain is temporary & moreover ""don't waste your pain.  Use it to help others instead.""  ""Life,"" of course, ""is meant to be shared"" and there's no better way to do so,  in Warren's view, than by being not only a member of your local congregation, but also by being active in it as well---""such builds spiritual muscle.""  In summary, you ought to seek people to live with, priciples to live by, a profession to live out, & the power to live on.  Warren, an evangalistic Christian himself, thus laments the fact that too many people are apparently living lives of ""aimless distraction"" today.  In his words, ""you are not an accident.""  You ought, consequently, mull that over if you are not leading ""A Purpose Driven Life"" at the moment.  ""Everyone's life is driven by something,"" but what's the driving force of your life: Living for friday nights? Living for a retirement lifestyle you might not live long enough to experience?  Living for the accumulation of material goods? Living for selfish, transitory, gratification?  In contradistinction, according to Warren, ""There's nothing more important than developing a relationship with God.""  ""You cannot,"" he concludes, exult God & yourself at the same time.""  Choose the former, he recommends, so as to ""experience real fellowship,"" an ""essential part of Christian life"" and make your stay on earth a meaningful one;"" or, in Warren's phrase, ""A Purpose Driven One.""  Secularists, of course, are not going to like this advice.  No doubt because  they have embraced an alternative faith already---What are extreme anti-globalization adherents & the like, if not people in search of  a sense of community; of belonging to something greater than themselves.  Warren cautions, however, those so inclined that when 'Man' begins to think himself God we had better all watch out.  Better to respect who's who & acknowledge humankind is not perfect---and can never be...& if you don't personally agree how about respecting those who do?  Believers in God, contrary to what secularists would have all believe, are not space cadets, loons, and/or just plain crazy (which is why this book would be worthwhile to non-believers as well, as it might help such folk understand better those whose faith is based in God).

Honestly, I was a little afraid to read it because nearly  everyone has loved it. I am not usually one for the sugary sweet teen romance books and I was afraid that's what Anna would be.While there were definitely those cutesy moments, they were never unrealistic. A lot of teen rom-com books place so much stock in the ""romance"" portion of the book that the characters suffer. What I loved about this book is that the characters stood for themselves. Anna is incredibly well-rounded and extremely easy to relate to. I saw so much of myself in her character and I think a lot of girls will see themselves in her too. She is in a word - real. Anna is insecure and overwhelmed by the sprawling city of Paris. She doesn't speak French, so she refuses to order anything complicated at meal time. She is intimidated by her classmates and she feels like she doesn't belong. She also has so many quirky little traits that really bring her to life. She wants to be a film critic and has a huge passion for old movies. She is a little goofy and is an extremely caring person. which is what really gets her into trouble.Almost immediately after Anna arrives in Paris she falls for one of her new friends, St. Clair. I mean, who wouldn't? Perkins went all out with this heartthrob. Our heroine never stood a chance. He's devastatingly handsome and excruciatingly charming. Oh and did I mention he has a British accent?  He's also quirky and caring and extremely down-to-earth. I just have one question... where can I find one?Anyways, unfortunately for Anna, St. Clair is taken. Because she is a good Southern girl, Anna decides the best plan of action is to hide her feelings for him. As the book and their friendship progress , Anna does a lot of maturing. I love when we see characters grow up throughout the story and Anna really comes into her own. She isn't perfect by any means - she makes plenty of mistakes along the way. But that's what makes her so relatable, you cannot help but cheer her on as the story unfolds.The plot line reminded me a lot of those old romantic comedies where the characters are always misunderstanding one another. I am assuming this was done on purpose, since Anna is obsessed with those old movies.  Much like the romantic comedies, it's almost painful for the reader because it is obvious how perfect Anna and St. Clair are for one another.Like I said before, there are a number of ""cutesy"" moments peppered throughout the novel. Please don't be put off by this, because they are done so well. Perkins has such a talent for understated charm - all of the Anna/ St. Clair moments are almost downplayed. It's not a book full of hot make out scenes  and tons of heat; it takes much more of a realistic approach. Because of this the reader is able to see how well the characters actually mesh together. Their relationship is an actual relationship - they have discussions, they tease one another and they take care of one another.Anna and the French Kiss was a remarkable debut. Perkins' set the bar so high with this one - I can only hope that her next book is half as good. Anna's story is honest, heartwarming and endearing.  She is easy to relate to and St. Clair is the perfect match for her. if you haven't read this book yet, you NEED to. No excuses , go find a copy right now.

It took me awhile to get a grasp on the main character, Ethan. The story also throws alot at you in the beginning, and I was trying to sort it all out. But once I got a feel for this world, I was dragged in. There were so many great Characters in this story. The Character development was spot on.This story is told in Ethan's point of view. Once I did get a good idea of who Ethan is, his point of view became one of my favorite parts. So many books in the YA world, especially in the supernatural romance genre, are told in a girl's point of view. The change was refreshing. Ethan is a good kid with a good head on his shoulders. While he is part of the ""popular crowd"", he is different than the rest of the popular kids in town. He thrives for more than what his small town can give him.Ethan's family was interesting to read about. Ethan's caretaker, Amma, was a cool chick. She is a very superstitious older lady that has many secrets hidden behind her fried chicken and lemon meringue pie. Ethan's dad was a shut in that hasn't gotten over the loss of his wife. I felt bad for Ethan. It was almost as if he lost both parents. I was glad he had Amma. Ethan's three great Aunts were hysterical, crazy old ladies that often had me cracking up.I loved Lena. Even though she wants to fit in and have friends at school, she can't pretend to be something she is not. She likes answering teachers questions and likes her assigned reading. If the world was right, girls like her would be the popular ones. I love how she has her own style. Lena carries alot of weight on her shoulders for a fifteen year old girl. She doesn't fully understand her powers yet and is terrified of what might happen when she turns sixteen. Lena lives with her uncle Macon in the very old family house(was house was totally awesome by the way). Even though I didn't know whether Macon was good or not in the beginning, I liked him right away for his dry sense of humor.The relationship between Ethan and Lena was great. They were so sweet together. Even though they have such a strong pull together with all the supernatural things happening to them (Trying not to give spoilers), the romance was gradual. I loved how the roles were switched from the norm in this story. Instead of the supernatural boy moving into a new town and meet mortal girl, you have exactly the opposite.This book reminded me of what it's like in a small town. You really got a good painting for what this town looks like. I could picture it in my head so easily. There were a few parts I had a hard time reading because of some of the small minded town's people. There was more than once that I wanted Lena to go full out Carrie on some of them. So much happened in the ending. It was completely epic, impossible to stop reading. I was left with alot of questions that I am dying to find out.I loved this story so much and I really wanted to give it a whole five stars. But I couldn't for one reason. The age of the highschool kids bothered me. These kids are supposed to be fifteen and sixteen, yet they are the school's popular crowd. They are the head cheerleaders and lead basketball players. It was almost like the older grades didn't exist.  I could have fallen for it if this was a large school. But I know in small towns with small schools, the different grades are more mixed.But in the end I really loved this original story. It had romance, magic, suspense, everything I want in a story.

I don't usually care for science fiction and time traveling, but my friend recommended the novel and gave me a copy as a gift, so I tried it out.  Just as I expected, I didn't care for the time traveling.  I found the first thirty pages terribly confusing as dates and ages jumped around.  For me, The Time Traveler's Wife had a rough start, but it picked up after the first hundred pages or so once I figured out the time structure of the story, and it culminated with the final scene as the best scene in the book.The book tells the love story between Henry, a librarian plagued with a genetic disorder that causes him to involuntarily time travel, and his wife Clare.  The story and concept are unique, interesting, and captivating.  They touch upon a wide variety of philosophical topics, such as love, free will, age differences within relationships, sex, waiting for love, and genetic therapy.  It provides a lot of material for both self-reflection and discussion with others.Although I enjoyed reading the novel and became engrossed in the storyline, I also found many faults with the book.  My main complaint is that the characters were flat.  The story is told with the alternating perspectives of Henry and Clare, however, I oftentimes could not remember whose perspective I was reading.  The two characters are too similar and are poorly developed as separate individuals.  Henry is clearly the main character, and Clare simply waits for him throughout her entire life.  Some people might find her relentless waiting as a testament to her love for Henry, but I found it pathetic and irritating.  She has no personality beyond Henry.  Furthermore, I found Henry interesting because of his time traveling predicament, but he is not at all what I would envision of as a romantic hero in a love story.  The author sets up numerous situations in which she could have explored their deeper emotions, but instead she only skims the surface.  Similarly, the author sets up some great supporting characters, but fails to give them any depth.In the end, The Time Traveler's Wife is not a bad book, but it's not a great book either.

Every day it could be anyone. There is never any warning.A has no family, no attachments. No religion, no traditions. Genderless, raceless, it is a very insightful life. But it is also very lonely. The only way A has found to survive is to stay on the periphery: Never get attached. Never stand out. Never interfere.Until A wakes up in Justin's body and meets his girlfriend, Rhiannon. Previously the ultimate interloper, A finally finds someone worth staying for; someone to know. As A struggles to connect with Rhiannon from different bodies and distances, they will both learn that love can come in many different forms in Every Day (2012) by David Levithan.As an editor and veteran novelist, Levithan is no stranger to writing compelling stories. Every Day lives up to the hype and praise it has been receiving. Levithan's writing is strong and often quite beautiful in this story of love and isolation.The initial premise is, understandably, difficult to accept. If you can get past that and willingly suspend your disbelief to go along with the story, you'll probably be able to deal with the other problems in the book. (If you can't, well, fantasies aren't for everyone.)Every Day starts strong, diving right into A's world and all of its inherent problems. Things get complicated both for A and the reader when Rhiannon enters the story and A falls in love with her based on seemingly nothing but first sight.Aside from feeling unconvincing in its speed and quick development, this love story came off very much as a plot device. In order for there to be a story connecting what would otherwise be day-long vignettes, A needs a reason to want to stay in one life. A needs a thread running through all of those different bodies. That thread becomes Rhiannon. But it could just as easily have become any number of other characters or things--making for a love story on shaky ground from the beginning.Throughout Every Day, Levithan is at pains to use A to highlight the diversity of our world and the different and varied lives teenagers inhabit each day. Through A, Levithan points out that gender, religion and many other identifiers are little more than arbitrary social constructs. While this is absolutely true, and generally well-handled throughout the book, it also started turning up in places where it did nothing to move the plot forward instead just reminding readers that diversity is real and valuable. (Again, true and well-handled, but not key to a gripping read in and of itself.)Similarly, the sheer scope of A's world and the book's premise often worked against Every Day. A inhabits many diverse characters throughout the story. But even while marveling at the myriad lives, it's easy for Every Day to feel very normative. The people A inhabits who are religious go to church. There are no synagogues or mosques here. There were no obviously unattractive bodies. While an injured person features, there was no one with a physical disability.Depression, addiction, suicide, and unhealthy relationships are all mentioned. But bullying never is. Abusive parents never are.Finally, and more annoyingly, while A necessarily has no gender, race, etc. A is apparently thin. Because when A is in an overweight teen, things really go over the top. Aside from being incredibly one-dimensional as A talks about the sheer effort needed to do little things when weighing so much, this depiction made no sense given A's context. Why, in this incredibly forward-thinking book, is weight so shocking and upsetting when gender/race/religion/social status are not? Why is this supposedly open-minded character so upset to be heavy? Why, in a book where looks are supposed to be secondary to personality, does overweight equate with being unattractive?The story ends optimistically enough to make any romantic swoon and almost makes up for the earlier issues with the plot and characterization. Every Day really is easy to enjoy with Levithan's effortless writing and the fascinating windows into so many different lives and worlds. The impact of A's condition and the resulting connections and eventual aloofness are achingly poignant. Unfortunately, because Levithan does so many things well in Every Day, it is also very easy to see where the novel ultimately falls short.Possible Pairings: Take Me There by Susane Colasanti, What Happened to Goodbye by Sarah Dessen, Why We Broke Up by Daniel Handler and Maira Kalman, Slide by Jill Hathaway, Team Human by Sarah Rees Brennan and Justine Larbalestier, Au Revoir, Crazy European Chick by Joe Schreiber, The Statistical Probability of Love at First Sight by Jennifer E.

It's odd, because the characters weren't extremely likable or well developed, which is generally very important to me.  However, in this case, the story really sucked me in and I couldn't put it down.Clare is a pretty normal person, growing up in linear time, waiting for the day when she will meet her husband, Henry.  Henry is eight years older than Clare, but he has a genetic brain condition that is a bit like epilepsy.  When he gets overly tired or stressed or exposed to flashing lights like a television gives off, he travels through time.Henry can't control or suppress this quirk, but he tends to travel to places where he has an emotional connection.  He has therefore witnessed his mother's violent death many times, and more often than not when he time travels he ends up in a meadow close to Clare's childhood home.Clare and Henry's relationship is very unusual.  He meets her for the first time when he is twenty-eight and she is twenty.  However, she knows him because as an older man he's been showing up in her meadow and spending time with her since she was six years old.I loved the questions this book raised in my mind.  Were Henry and Clare trapped into their futures?  Henry told Clare that they were married and she took it for granted that things would work out that way.  Could she have changed that, or was her future already set?  Both Clare and Henry shaped each other.  He interacted with her from the time she was a child until she was eighteen.  Then she met him at twenty and she took over shaping him into the middle-aged man she remembered coming to visit her.  Did they grow into themselves, or did knowing the future cause them to change each other in ways they would not have changed if not for their unusual situation?I also enjoyed the way Henry jumped around in time while Clare's future marched forward.  It was interesting to see the gaps in his knowledge because things that should have been in the past were still looming in his future.  I liked that he interacted with himself on some of his time travels and nothing catastrophic happened.  Some of the most interesting scenes contained two different versions of Henry.Overall, it made me think, and I appreciated that. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2237, 2251)",4,0.0,False

Old pagan gods still live on as destitute characters in the real world, as long as a few isolated pockets of people still venerate them. Meanwhile, really old gods that are completely forgotten by humanity have disappeared into oblivion. The major religions couldn't even obliterate these decrepit old pagan gods for good, but the real gods of modern America may finally do it - the harsh gods of money and technology. The straight man in the novel is a hapless ex-con named Shadow, who eventually realizes that the bizarre characters he keeps running into are those decaying pagan gods who need his help in their struggle. Shadow also eventually bumbles into the realization that these gods are allying themselves with him for a greater purpose. The concepts behind this book are indeed fascinating and highly creative.

My mother who was with stumbled into the YA section and picked this book up for me and said it sounded interesting. I bought it, but I didn't think much of it for the past three years. But last summer when I literally had nothing to read, I read this book after two previous attempts.I devoured this book in one day.*SPOILERS INCLUDED IN THIS REVIEW*There is not enough praise in the world I could give this book. Yes, I had read books about the Holocaust previously, but this book will stand out to me forever. Mr. Zusak's writing style is so captivating and distinct that no one but him could ever write like that. Sure, he breaks the cardinal rule of ""show don't tell"" but he does it in such a quirky way you really don't care and can't help but enjoy it.There isn't too much action in this book (if you want action go turn on Transformers) but ever scene was written beautifully and masterfully crafted. Although much of the book is about Liesel learning to read and her relationship with Hans, and Rosa, and Max, and Rudy, the Holocaust was elegantly woven throughout the entire book. Even if Liesel is playing soccer or reading or having fun, you still sense the gloom and the mood of the war.Even though Mr. Zusak's writing is superb, the real gems of this novel (tarnished however, in the best way possible of course) are the characters--each one his or her own individual and equally unique and realistic. Liesel was such a relatable character to me, because she acted like a normal 9 year-old girl at the start and 10, 11, and 12 year-old as the book progressed. She struggled to fit in, and she was, not to mention, illiterate. How she overcomes those struggles is what makes her such a wonderful character. Max was fantastic and you couldn't help but dread his fate, Rudy was lovable and you couldn't help but bawl when he died, Hans was the dad you wished you had, Rosa was an animated character that you couldn't help but secretly love.But the most interesting character, perhaps, was the narrator: Death itself. No, we did not get a back story to Death (how could we ever?), but Death was so quirky and witty he was a character, too!The book provided an interesting point of view from a German girl's perspective. This is a book that can be life altering--it really and truly opened my eyes. The ending was probably one of the saddest, most bittersweet ones I have read in quite some times. I cried for nearly ten minutes and then re-read the ending again. You will laugh at Rudy's witty remarks as well as Liesel's snarky comebacks. Your heart will melt when you read about Hans and Max. You will feel Rosa's pain. Most of all, you will experience all of this through Death's perspective.One of the best books I have read in a while. Perhaps I am overrating his book like crazy, but in my eyes, it deserves it all.Overall Grade: A++++++(Haha, no I'm just kidding....)

A heroine that is more than just a cardboard cut out! We finally get it. Not only that, but we get a mostly conflict free relationship. Oh how good it feels to finally read about someone NOT assuming in a relationship.Jane is amazing. A-MA-ZING. She is exactly my kind of strong character. She doesn't put up with any bull while at the same time making sure her feelings are known. It has been a sort of trend with this series, with the heroines not being able to fully express their feelings or because they held them in something else was assumed. So, to me, Jane is an absolute breath of fresh air.Vishous, I should say that his story includes some pretty awful abuse and I could almost say trigger warning for certain parts. I do love the fact that he's into BDSM, not just for the awesome sex scenes (which, btw, were not shown fully when he was in `Dom' mode), but because during a certain part it shows us more of his character. Wish I could elaborate, it's one of those things that would spoil you. Anywho, his past is full of pain, and so is his present, so it makes a very compelling story. I know I was kept on my toes.I'm not sure whose past is worst in the Brotherhood. What it really boils down to is everyone's past has sucked so far and I don't really think it would be fair of me to compare them. What they all really need is a group hug and group therapy.We get a lot of Phury in Lover Unbound. Phury and his destructive nature. His very, very, destructive nature. I love his character so much that reading about all he was doing really made me uncomfortable. Let us hope that his book makes him better, otherwise he needs help...badly.Even better is that this book features no Lesser POV. Yes! Yes! I hate reading about the Lessers in their POV so I was extremely happy. But, because of this we really don't get any serious fighting except for a few times.As for the Chosen, I have to say that that whole thing was RIDICULOUS. Not just because a primale gets to `mate' with ALL of the chosen (like 40 females) and he gets a `main' female, but because if a Chosen doesn't want to give her body to him she's bound and gagged- FORCED to go through the ritual. Sounds like rape to me and this has been going on for forever! I was totally creeped out and astounded that the Scribe Virgin would let that happen. Especially considering HER own past.Tons of major plot moments though, mostly centering around Jane and V, but a few elsewhere. Lover Unbound moves at a nice pace and didn't drag, it did the opposite in fact. It threw me onto a carnival ride that jumbled my insides and made me cry buckets of massive tears. I have heartburn from the tears. If you cried during the others, you will definitely cry with Lover Unbound because the unexpected happens. I literally cried through the last few chapters.That ending though. I'm gonna have to say it was a cop-out. While I want the very best to always happen, in this case I don't think it should have. Mean of me, awful of me, but I honestly think it should have been left right where it was.Overall, I still think the series gets better and better with each passing book. Loved Lover Unbound, and it's definitely competing with Lover Awakened for the top spot. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3239, 3253)",1,0.0,False

I would definitely place it on my top 5 list of all times and I have read hundreds and hundreds of books.Katniss is such an engaging character.  The reader is drawn to her instantly, as we are plunged into a futuristic world of oppression, poverty and despair.  Katniss has taken on the responsibility of caring for her family after her father died in a mining explosion and her mother shut down.  Katniss is daring and ventures out into forbidden areas to hunt and gather food to sell to the people in her ""district"".  Her only goal in life seems to be keeping her little sister safe.The government has set up a lottery in each of the twelve ""districts"" in this futuristic country.  One boy and one girl are chosen to go fight to the death with the ""tributes"" from the other eleven districts.  When Prim, Katniss's little sister, is chosen for the Hunger Games as they are called Katniss steps forward and volunteers to go in her place.Katniss goes to the capitol with the other tribute from her district, a boy named Peeta, and there they must put on a good show before the game begins.  If they set up the right image they could get sponsors during the game, which means they will receive gifts and help once they enter the arena.  Sponsors are the difference between life and death for many tributes so it is important to give the people what they want.The game itself is brutal.  It reminded me a tiny bit of the show survivor, only in this game you have to kill off all the other players.  Katniss has a slight advantage from her hunting and gathering experience, but she must also use her wits and bravery to keep herself alive.  Foreign alliances with other players can be helpful, but true trust and friendship is practically impossible since there can only be one winner.The book drives its characters to the very edge of their abilities.  We see how people react in the most primal and brutal situations: forced to kill or be killed.  I loved seeing the tributes come up with different strategies for survival, and how the game makers who control everything in the arena throw the tributes at each other through force and bribery.I read this book yesterday, and had dreams and nightmares about it all night.

What makes a particular book stand out from the crowded genre of overdone supernatural creatures and trite romances? I don't think there is one answer for this. I think it depends upon what each reader looks for in a book. What I do know, is that Die For Me has now leaped to the top of the list of post-Twilight paranormal romances (excepting epic books like Vampire Academy and The Mortal Instruments). If you could write out a formula for what I look for in a paranormal romance book, Die For Me would be sitting next to the equal symbol.What exactly does Die For Me have going for it?1. Setting: Oooh...Paris. I've only spent 3 days in Paris, but I definitely want to spend more. The Paris in Die For Me is both mysterious and romantic. You have peaceful cafes (as long as nothing is falling from the sky), parks, the Seine, ornate architecture, dark clubs, dangerous catacombs - the contradiction of dark and light that is Paris.2. Writing: I like books that are well-written. No surprise there. Who would say anything otherwise? As nice as it is to read books of literary quality, for paranormal romance, I'm looking for a balance. I like books that have richly described settings, characters, and mythology backgrounds, but the descriptions of which don't drag the book down. Die For Me does this perfectly. I got a strong impression of Kate and Vincent's world, but the writing was smooth and easy to read. I could lose myself in the plot instead of focusing on the intricacies of the prose.3. Pacing: This is a subset of writing, but I thought it merited its own discussion. So often paranormals take forever to get going and then have heart-stopping action that has you flipping pages to get to the end. This isn't a bad thing, but often it feels like a chore. Like having to lick a Tootsie Pop a million times until you finally get to the candy. Die For Me had great pacing. It took awhile for the paranormal element to unfold, but the beginning plot and character development were interesting enough that I never felt like I was trudging through the novel. It got very tense toward the end, but wasn't such a page-turner that I wasn't able to slow down and enjoy myself. Well done.4. Paranormal Element: There are only so many supernatural creatures to choose from if you're going to stick to traditional legends. Vampires, werewolves, demons, fairies, angels, shape-shifters, ghosts, zombies. Die For Me borrows from traditional paranormal elements, but manages to be unique. The revenants are not ghosts nor are they zombies. They are creatures who are immortal yet die and die again. I've never read anything like it. So refreshing to read something new.5. Romance: Die For Me does have the other-worldly romance that I often dislike in YA novels. They don't fall instantly in love, but there is an immediate connection. I still fell in love with Kate and Vincent romance. The book occurs over a long enough time span that they actually have time to go on a few dates before being ready to die for each other. Vincent is such a good guy. A mixture of reserve, bravery, kindness, intelligence, and passion that fits my formula for a romantic hero. And good looks of course.6. Supporting Characters: This is the big one for me. It's what really made Die For Me shine. The story isn't just about Kate and Vincent. There are numerous supporting characters all of whom have well-described, distinct personalities and play important roles in the story. Vincent's fellow revenants are not blood relatives, but they are a family for all intents and purposes. I loved funny Ambrose, boastful Jules, Alice Cullen-like Charlotte, nervous Gaspard, prickly Charles, patriarch Jean-Baptiste, and motherly Jeanne. I felt like a book could easily be written about each character. Much like the Cullens. Of course, you also have Kate's family: Georgia, Mamie, and Papy, but the revenant family was the what I most enjoyed.Die For Me is not a perfect book. You could argue the romance is nothing new (although I liked it). I also thought it was odd that Kate was grieving her parents' deaths at the beginning of the book, but that theme practically disappeared as the book went on. No problem...no book is flawless. Die For Me had everything I want in a paranormal and for that reason, I can't recommend it enough.Rating: 5 / 5 ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(4384, 4398)",1,0.0,False

Many other authors might fill several pages with description while this author paints extremely vivid pictures with only a few brush strokes. I also enjoyed the conversational tone of the narrative. As if, Katniss was telling her tale directly to me in my own home and if you know Katniss, she doesn't just trust anyone. So the illusion that I might just be a personal friend and confident to Katniss was truly impressive. And oh, did I feel her pain, her rage, her despair! Not very often there comes a story that is truly magic! I mean, Harry Potter, was a story about magic and has the place of highest honor on my bookshelves next to the Lord of the Rings books, but this one is entirely different.

Of course, he has other problems&#8212;like uncool parents and almost no friends. Just before the grandfather who Jacob adores dies under mysterious circumstances, he leaves Jacob with a cryptic message about finding &#8220;The Bird.&#8221; Add this to incessant nightmares of monsters, and Jacob is soon sent to a psychiatrist. When Jacob decides he must go to a small island in the UK, Dr. Golan is supportive. Jacob&#8217;s father goes along to study the local birds. The story that Jacob begins to uncover becomes more and more complicated as he discovers that the silly stories people thought his grandfather made up were, in fact, real. And Jacob is not as boringly normal as he&#8217;s always thought.Ransom Riggs has written a very creative and entertaining story. His idea of spinning a tale based on peculiar old photographs is fresh and different. Jacob is a likeable protagonist.  The writing, particularly descriptions, is strong. There is a good bit of profanity, but it&#8217;s realistic for the way 16-year-old Americans talk among friends.As the story builds to its climax, I began to wonder if Riggs got a little hurried. One example, a European character who has spoken in rather formal 1940&#8217;s speech wants to find out who&#8217;s going to accompany her for something difficult. &#8220;Who&#8217;s in?&#8221; she asks, sounding like a current American. By the end, certain things seem to happen a little too easily, or be drawn out a little too long, and I was reading more rapidly. The ending come rather suddenly and leaves plenty of problems for Riggs and his characters to solve in the next book.Overall, a fun read for teens and many adults, too.

Well, among other things.  She's been raised by a non-human bearing the ominous name Brimstone and runs errands to do rather grizzly things for him.  With her blue hair, Karou stands out, anyway, but by her skills and background, she is even more unusual than appearances would dictate.  Taylor develops the story well, beginning with the art student, and gradually expanding our knowledge of her and her skills, `family', and other activities.  Through her life with Brimstone and others in their difficult to access nooks around the world, Karou discovers enemies and peers she wasn't aware of.  In fact a goodly part of the story involves Karou's working to find out who and what she is.  She makes mistakes based on curiosity and impulsivity, but does so mostly through good intentions.  She befriends fellow art student Zuzana, and finds a badly needed loyal tie.  Karou faces many challenges, some from romantic feelings, some from obligation to Brimstone and her surrogate family, some to higher principles, some to humans and non-humans of unsavory lives,  Taylor weaves these all deftly to create a very novel world beyond Karou's Prague home and develops a complex and enjoyable young woman in a well-sequenced way so that the reader unfolds her and her challenges gradually and engagingly.  The created other world and its animosities are also believable in their sentiments, if a bit farfetched as appropriate in a fantasy story, and frightening for Karou.  Too much happens to comment further on events of the story.  That said, while I usually don't consider fantasy my genre of choice, in YA books there seems to be a difference for me.

With every book she has published, I swear she can't possibly get any better, could not possibly top herself. And yet she does. Every. Single. Book. is better than the last. And that says a lot considering her first book was Slammed. I mean, seriously?? How does she do it? I am in complete awe. I say it every time, I know I do, but my admiration and respect of this author has reached New heights.Hopeless was a phenomenal book. The story was heartbreaking... the story of Hope/Sky and her life literally broke me. The love story between Sky and Holder was a beautiful one, undeniably so. But Losing Hope just took all my love for this story and multiplied it exponentially.First off, we met Dean Holder again but we get to know him in a whole new way. A way that makes me love him even more than I thought I already had. His telling of his sister's suicide was possibly the most heart wrenching depiction of a suicide I've ever read. Suicide is always tragic, of course... But unless you've lived through that kind of personal loss, I think we take the depth of this kind of tragedy for granted. Well Colleen Hoover takes you there. Dean's story shredded me. I found the entire story line surrounding Les... Her childhood, her utter hopelessness, her subsequent death... I found it almost more heart breaking than Sky's story. It just struck a chord with me this time around that I will never get over. Colleen Hoover really nails you in the gut with Les' suicide, it's agonizing to think of what lead Les to this place of feeling absolutely nothing anymore and her willingness to give it all up. I could taste Dean's feeling of hopelessness, of second guessing everything he could have said or done differently to save his sister from something that seems so preventable but in reality, was near impossible to save her from. I felt every ounce of anger he felt toward her about what she left behind, his anger toward her for what he and her family were left to deal with, the pain that never went away. And the letters... the letters made me laugh, cry, get angry... they were perfect. They kept Les alive in her absence, they created this amazing dynamic within the story that would have been virtually impossible to achieve any other way. We got to know Les, we grew to know the relationship between the siblings through these letters, we felt the range of Dean's emotions through his writing. It was just a perfect element that added so much to this book.Getting to relive the love story between Sky and Dean again was an amazing thing... But there's just something magical about getting it all from Dean's point of view. All those blanks filled in, all those stones unturned. You just get the whole package with a sequel from the other partner's perspective and it really gives you completion and satisfaction and closure that the love you know Sky felt for Dean is reciprocated tenfold. But knowing what Dean felt for Sky, what he felt for Hope, and knowing the pain he had lived with for years in between literally stole my breath away. It's a miracle this guy came out of all that he endured... all that he carried on his shoulders since he was practically a toddler, really. Yes, Hope disappeared when they were five. But he was her rock for years before that, just holding the pinky of the sad little girl next door. And with Losing Hope, you're treated to this amazing miracle of how he felt finding her again and how truly miraculous it is that his love for Hope and his love for Sky were both independent from each other, but yet undeniably connected. It's as if no matter where Hope went, had she never even gone anywhere, or whether or not Hope did or didn't end up as Sky, Dean Holder was meant to love her.This story is so layered. I'm still sitting here trying to get my chin off the floor as I go over and over the web that Colleen Hoover has woven with this book. The links between these characters, no matter how separated they thought they had become, how lost they believed they were to each other... their lives were so tied up in each other. Aside from the obvious, that Dean and Sky lived within miles of each other without ever knowing so, so much about how severely their lives overlapped, how one's decisions and choices and actions effected the others without ever consciously knowing it... it's absolutely awe inspiring to think about what Ms Hoover created here. Brilliant is really the only word I can use and I still don't believe that does the book justice. You live this book.I think too often an author attempts to retell a story from the male perspective and it becomes a story of cut and paste. You come out of it feeling like you just reread a story you already knew. This book is like reading an entirely different story. You think you know this story, you think you know the plot because you read Hopeless... You believe you know these characters and their story of how it began, how it ended and everything in between. But here's a bomb... You know nothing. You know nothing until the very last page of Losing Hope, when you finally have all the pieces, the completed puzzle... You have closure, you find peace with this story. You learn forgiveness in this book, you regain hope. This book is amazing. This book is a masterpiece of epic proportions.

But I had heard good things about Hugh Howey's ""Wool,"" and was all the more intrigued to hear it began life as a series of self-published e-books before gaining popularity and a physical print edition.  And seeing that so many high-profile writers had good things to say about the book seemed promising.  So when our library got the omnibus edition of the book (the first five ""Wool"" novellas), I knew I had to take a look.I'm rather glad I ventured outside my comfort zone with this book.  It's not only a good post-apocalyptic sci-fi novel, but it's a phenomenal book period.  And I believe even those who don't like science fiction will enjoy it.At an unspecified point in the future, the surface world has been virtually destroyed -- by what or whom, no one remembers.  Humanity now lives in an underground complex called ""the silo,"" over a hundred and forty levels where people are born, live, and die without ever seeing or even thinking about the outside world.  Any thoughts of rebellion are not tolerated, and even mentioning the outside is a crime punishable by ""cleaning"" -- being sent outside, where the condemned will live just long enough to clean the windows of the silo's topmost level.  When the silo's sheriff is sent out to clean, the mayor chooses Juliette, a mechanic from the lowest levels of the silo, as his unlikely successor.  Juliette is reluctant at first, feeling she understands machines better than the silo's politics, but soon she comes to realize that there is something very wrong with the world of the silo.  And when she tries to understand why the previous sheriff was executed -- and begins to fall for a young IT worker named Lukas -- she uncovers information that some would rather see hidden... and inadvertently sparks a rebellion that could destroy the silo.Hugh Howey has invented a unique and believable world, one that feels all too plausible and workable.  The self-contained world of the silo feels logically described, as if it could really function with today's level of technology.  Many science fiction books require the reader to willingly suspend their disbelief and seem to operate on ""Rule of Cool,"" but ""Wool"" feels as if it could actually happen... which is a scary thought but makes the story all the more believable and gripping.Also unusually for a science fiction book, the characters in this book are fully-realized, fleshed-out beings rather than two-dimensional clich&eacute;s.  They have their own quirks and flaws, fears and dreams, and it's easy to grow attached to them -- to the point where it can come as a shock when a favorite character dies.  Juliette, in particular, is a well-done character, and I found myself both cheering her on and fearing for her safety as she faced horrific trials through the book.  Even Bernard, the head of IT and the book's villain, is a complex character with his own reasons for doing what he does.Finally, I love the author's writing style -- it's neither bland and workmanlike, nor overly flowery and ""purple.""  I've read plenty of books where the writing, while competent, is nothing special, and plenty of books where the author becomes overly descriptive or uses so many strange words I find myself reaching for a thesaurus every paragraph or so.  Howey hits the right balance, with just enough description to bring his world vividly to life and a writing style that keeps the reader turning the pages.  It reminds me of Stephen King, in a way -- the word choices are unique but appropriate for the situation, and bring his world to life.Quite possibly one of the best books I've read all year, this is a book that even those who don't normally read science fiction will enjoy.  A combination of a unique plot, strongly built world, richly realized characters, and a masterful writing style make it a great read.  Here's hoping it finds a spot as a sci-fi classic, right up there with ""The Martian Chronicles"" and ""The Stand."" ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(4078, 4092)",1,0.0,False

The book is rife with period detail and highly descriptive passages that give the reader a taste of what living in Chicago was like at that time.The book provides a fascinating look at the enormous work and planning that went into creating the Chicago World's Fair, making it into one that was truly remarkable for its time, given some of the problems that the architects had to overcome. It also provides a fascinating look into the lives of some of the key players involved in its creation.Meanwhile, an enterprising and charismatic killer was also at work, his story being tied into that of the creation of the Chicago World's Fair itself. His story, however, is the weaker part of the book, as it lacks the detail that is evident in the other segment of the book. Still, it provides an interesting look into the life of a serial killer who seemed to go about his grisly business with impunity, as well as a look at crime, law enforcement, and the state of criminal justice in late nineteenth century Chicago.The photographs that were included in the book are excellent and illustrative.

The feel and tone of the book was the same, but, the characters and storyline were outstanding.First off, I loved the characters' voices. I felt like I was able to relate to them and understood their thoughts and decisions. Della has a very sheltered background but not once did I ever view her as nave or helpless. I admired her, which in turn had me rooting for her the entire book. Della has a past - a very sad past - and it still haunts her, but at least she's not running from it. What I found to be interesting about her is that she knows she has to live life and she does. She doesn't let her past control her and she never once acts like a victim. I found her to be extremely strong, which given her situation I wouldn't expect her to be, but was so glad she was!And Woods. I felt for him and his circumstances so I understood why he made some bad decisions. I also loved being in his head. He was just...perfection to me. All his life he was on the path his father had put him on, but he knew how miserable it would make him. Until he met Della serendipitously, he had just accepted his life and how it would turn out. But once Della reappeared in his life, she made him question everything.Woods tried to stay away from Della and follow his father's plan. I give him an A+ for effort and I think that is what I sort of loved about him. He followed through on his promises and he really wasn't a total ass, except when he needed to be. But, he also couldn't ignore the feelings Della stirred in him either. Just another thing I loved about him - he followed his gut and his heart.So I sat down to read this book telling myself I'd give myself only an hour or two before I got some real life stuff accomplished. About four hours later I was done with the book - and real life stuff still didn't get done. This book was THAT good. I honestly don't know if it was that I really LOVED Woods or if I just loved the story as a whole. Maybe both? I have nothing negative to say about this one nor would I change anything. There is a sequel per se to this book, but it doesn't end on a cliffhanger. There is just more to the story. I cannot wait for the release of Simple Perfection in September!This is the third book in the Rosemary Beach series, although this book can be read without reading the first two books.

How can everything be unique or spectacular, for then good would surely be reduced to average?  However, certain books (like any work of art or product/commodity) turn  out to be true Classics, with broader and broader appeal; they actually  improve with age as fine wine.Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card, can only  be described as a true classic.  It is a unique and brilliantly written  work that keeps the reader enthralled and entertained throughout.  The  novel reads better now than when it was first published twenty-three years  ago.  The first book in a series (now five books total) of stories that  revolve around lead character Andrew (Ender) Wiggin, Card weaves a totally  believable universe containing two completely incompatible and utterly  at-odds interplanetary species.  One is the human race and one is a society  of creatures known only as the &quot;Buggers&quot; due to their resemblance  to insects.  Earth society has temporarily suspended international  hostilities to join together and fight the alien menace.  This  international cooperation spawns a worldwide recruiting process to  identify, gather and train the best and brightest child minds.  The  ultimate goal is to mold them into leaders of the future human  attack/defense forces against the alien Buggers.Card does an amazing job  of relating the thoughts and fears of children in the story, who are almost  exclusively the main characters.  Also, he provides the characters with  passion, strength and emotions that one would expect to see in children  pushed to the brink of endurance.  Title character Ender Wiggin is  unknowingly pre-selected to lead the human forces pending his successful  training regimen, and the majority of the novel focuses in the time period  Ender spends training in Card's wonderful invention, the &quot;Battle  Room&quot;.  The Battle Room and the &quot;Battle School&quot; are the main  reasons this novel is great SF.  It combines futuristic scientific  applications that seem only just outside of current human reach, such as  interstellar travel and control of gravity, plus the wonderfully depicted  psychological interplay of a group of the most talented and aggressive  youths the planet has to offer.Stylistically, Card is an excellent  writer.  His dialogue is top notch, and readers become very interested in  the characters he aptly portrays.  He uses strong, active verbs, that keep  you on edge and reading the story way past bedtime.  Recently, Card  published the fifth novel in the series, Ender's Shadow, which retells the  same story from the angle of a different character.  Fans already familiar  with the series will find the desire to re-read Ender's Game to  cross-reference the newest addition to the Ender Universe.  Like many great  works by Jules Verne, appreciation of the Ender Universe continues to grow  as time passes.  The exponential increases in current technology in recent  years only help bring Card's ideas into sharper focus and greater  believability.This is a must read book for all that claim to be fans of  the SF genre.  However, the story also stands on its own with exciting  action sequences and exceptionally likeable and well developed characters.  It was both a Hugo and Nebula award winner, which is validaion to give it  an automatic read for most SF fans.  Do so, you will be glad you did.

Roosevelt appointed William Dodd to be the first United States Ambassador to Germany, under Hitler. Dodd, at the age of 64, would have preferred to retire from his job as a professor of the history department at the University of Chicago, and complete his memoir ""Old South."" Out of respect for the President and duty to his country Dodd reluctantly accepted the appointment.  With his wife, Martha, an adult son and daughter, set sail for Berlin, on July 5, 1933 shortly after Hitler became Chancellor of Germany.Though appalled by Nazi persecution of Jews, Roosevelt refrained from issuing any direct statement of condemnation.  He expected from Dodd to see to it that Germany pays her debts to the American creditors. Some of State Department's most senior officers harbored an outright dislike of Jews. William J Carr, an assistant Secretary of State called the Jews ""kikes""; Russian and polish immigrants are filthy, un-American and often dangerous in their habits (P.30). It is very disturbing to read in the book the anti-Semitism that prevailed in 1930's among many Americans. Dodd complained that there were too many Jews on his own staff. The indifference and anti-Semitism in the U.S. obviously couldn't hinder Hitler's ascent and march of conquest with tragic consequences. Dodd was one of the few voices in U.S. government to warn of the true ambitions of Hitler and the dangers of American isolationists' stance. Most Americans wanted to stay out of Europe's squabbles. In June 1938, Dodd talked of Hitler's hatred of Jews and warned that his true intent was ""to kill them all."" (p.351)As a captive in Nazi concentration camp, I had been wondering; why the United States, a nation founded and populated by many oppressed immigrants, of different faiths, from many lands did not stop Hitler's genocide? Where were the good Samaritans among the American Christians?  They were expected to have compassionate regard for all people, not just some people! Where were the fighters for human rights? How could their humanitarian reputation be maintained when our suffering became unbearable? Why civilized nation did shirk their responsibilities to show pity for us. I doubted if the faithful, of religious denominations, said a prayer for our deliverance! Was it not a betrayal of basic human solidarity? Was it not a failure of the entire moral fabric of society? Even mass demonstrations, in the democratic countries around the world would have forced the German to stop or at least moderate their policy of Ausrottung (the extermination) of European Jewry. If President Roosevelt had been more vociferous in expressing his and the American people's indignation, the nonchalant world would have been awakened and protested the slaughter innocent people.. The indifference enabled the Nazis to victimize every Jew; subsequently not every victim was a Jew. Winston Churchill said: the Holocaust was not just a Jewish tragedy; it was the world's tragedy, because the world did let it happen.THE GARDEN OF BEASTS is compelling and horrifying. Larson is a masterful storyteller. Although much given detail does not pertain to the core story, the book based on Dodd's diary and the ancillary writings of others, is extensively researched, and very well written.

I read this book having recently returned from an extended visit to East Africa so I was intrigued by the breadth of data presented in it.  However, from the synthesis of this geographic data, the historical conclusions are entirely off base.I definitely agree with the author's premise that geographical assets are significant in the development of civilizations, but Mr. Diamond's leap from geographic assistance in development to historical mandate of dominance is weak.  If Mr. Diamond's assertions are to be believed, then clearly China should rule the world,(that chapter on the exemption of China was weak) if not them then India or one of the many mysterious North American civilizations.As a student of Mexican and Native American history, I understand that guns had very little to do with the conquest of the Mexica and subjugation of the Aztec peoples.  The guns of the Castilian conquistadores weren't even guns at all, but were in fact clumsy arquebuses, weapons of limited range and efficiency.Individually, the Castilian's best military advantage was probably the horse closely followed by their Toledo steel. Yet even armed with those weapons they still were very close to defeat on several occasions. In fact, all of the Conquistadores adopted Native American cotton armor because it was far superior. The primary reason they triumphed over the peoples in the Valley of Mexico was their clever use of politics and propaganda.Overlooked in the analysis of this book is the impact of significant people and significant movements. I understand that in American history, you take away Abraham Lincoln and we have two separate countries. Take away Genghis Khan, and the peoples of Western Europe would probably be speaking Arabic. Take away Taoism and Confucianism from China and perhaps they throw the might of their civilization into agressive expansion.Basically, the book is fundamentally flawed because you can't neatly tidy up history into the sum of certain geographical circumstances.  To be fair, you can't also solely use religion or economics.  History is the combination of all of these elements and so much more.  It is entirely beyond me why this book is as lauded as much as it is today.  As a compendium of geographical, botanical and biological information there are no new revelations.  The historical assumptions derived from this information, despite your opinion of their validity are not new either.  Maybe its the glowing endorsement from Bill Gates?

About the only thing that's going for this novel is the terrific ending, with a huge surprise waiting in the final line.  But to get there, you have to wade through about 650 pages of tripe, and that's in the hardcover edition.For most of the book, the plot is fairly straightforward.  There's a group of eight people who need to get from point A to point B, where point A is called The Two Rivers and point B is called Tar Valon.  Meanwhile, an archvillian known as The Dark One sends overwhelming sinister forces to stop them.  This portion of the book isn't developed with much skill, which is what makes it pretty boring.  All that the good guys have to do is swing their swords around a few times and they can easily defeat entire armies of bad guys.  One top of that, the good guys are led by an Aes Sedai (a female wizard) who can do more or less anything, so there's never any real sense of danger.  The action scenes also grow very repetitive.  For instance, there's one scene where our heroes are being chased by a horde of villians, but luckily they're able to run into a magic place where the bad guys just aren't willing to go.  This exact same scene gets repeated twice later in the novel.Many people seem to think that the characterizations are one of this novel's strengths, but I don't agree.  The main character is named Rand al'Thor, and the novel is supposed to show him changing from an ordinary farmboy into a great warrior.  The problem is that he doesn't act like an ordinary person at the start; none of the five characters who grew up in a small down do.  They all acts like soldiers right from the start.  They're willing to plunge into battle without any hesitation, and the children always act totally grown up.  I found the characters to be largely static and unbelievable.This certainly isn't a terrible novel.  As I mentioned, it does have a wonderful surprise ending.  Just don't expect to be swept away by it.  Also, be sure to read the gloassary at the end, which is more entertaining than most of the book.

The main character is Jocelyn (Joss), a 22 year-old woman who is doing anything she can to forget her tragic past. She is afraid to lose anyone else that she cares about, so she distances herself from people to keep from caring about anybody.Joss has many issues and is incredibly stubborn and infuriating. She meets a man named Braden, and they have an instant attraction. No matter how much she wants to be with him, she refuses because she doesn't want to be in a relationship. You will want to yell at her throughout the book because of the decisions she makes. Braden is a very successful and handsome man. He also has some past issues but he isn't as broken as Joss. He is determined to win her heart and comes up with an interesting arrangement that Joss agrees to. Let me just say that you will be fanning yourself while reading this. It's very intense and sexy.The background characters were really interesting. I loved reading about Braden's sister Ellie and his friend Adam. There was a lot of sexual tension between them. Overall, the storyline was interesting and I really enjoyed it. It was a very emotional ride. I recommend this to anyone who loved 50 Shades of Gray, or anyone who just loves sexy, emotional romances. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1305, 1319)",1,0.0,False

Tipping Point is highly entertaining and gave me some great food for thought. The book, however, is not without flaws.Gladwell's work has much to recommend it. He has a great ability to take dry social science and turn it into something interesting. I think that accounts for Gladwell's success on the best seller lists. As someone who reads a fair number of academic journal articles, I was particularly impressed with Gladwell's ability to take work from different academic sources and ""synthesize"" that work into an interesting story.While Gladwell work has many admirers, a number of commentators are critical of his work. I think that many of the criticisms are well founded. Critics have noted that Gladwell tends to take very complex phenomena and ""dumb them down"" in a way that makes the phenomena more entertaining for readers. I think that this is a valid criticism of Tipping Point.As an example, in his discussion of the spread of trends, Gladwell holds that all ideas gain acceptance in pretty much the same fashion; a few ""Influentials"" adopt the idea, the Influentials provide the idea to people who are socially connected, and eventually the idea hits the mainstream. Research suggests, however, that different types of ideas spread in different ways. Gladwell goes on at length about the comeback of Florsheim shoes in the 1990s; but is it realistic to expect that shoe preferences among Manhattan hipsters (a fad) gain acceptance in the same manner as more lasting changes in people's views (e.g., the acceptance of the theory of evolution or the need for equal rights)? Gladwell tells a great story, but the lack of depth often ignores complexities that are difficult to explain.Gladwell provides an interesting starting point for readers interested in how trends gain acceptance. Readers should be aware, however, that Gladwell fails to answers many important questions about the spread of ideas. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2011, 2025)",2,0.0,False

America Singer is a Five,just like her family. Neither are they on the verybottom of the caste-system nor one of theprivileged. Life is a struggle. Her mother hashigh hopes for America, and is delighted that shegot picked to take part in 'The Selection'. PrinceMaxon has come off age. He's ready to claim abride, the future princess of Ill&eacute;a. Competingagainst over thirty other young women is not whatAmerica wants. Then again, how can she disappointthe people she loves; keep them from a betterlife? Getting to know the supposedly arrogantMaxon for who he really is - anything but - onlymakes it harder.Finally, thank you - a dystopian young adult novel that pretty much catered to my every whim. I'm aware of the Goodreads drama surrounding this release, but to be honest, I don't care. The blurb captured my interested and I'm so thankful I was provided with a review copy. That's what it should be about. The book, the story itself! It's such a fabulous one, too. I think you should expect to be entertained and thus not think about every little detail too hard. This book is fun and it has a fresh take on the dystopia genre. I loved the modern elements! It made it easier to relate to the characters and what was happening to them.The writing was smooth and very teen-ish in an adequate way. Considering the heroines age, that most definitely is to be taken as a compliment. I liked America's voice. What I loved about the character? She was not bitter about being born a Five, instead, made the best out of her circumstances. It's truly awesome to see her smile, take joy in simple pleasantries. On the other hand, America was also a typical teenager wanting to break free of her confines. A lot of readers wrote about the heroine being stupid. I disagree. Being a teenager or a young woman for that matter entails (or excuses if you want) a certain degree of confusion. Everyone is entitled to make mistakes and be unreasonable. I didn't like her any less just because I found her actions questionable (at times).High praise for the author: The world building was flawless. She included important information in such a way that it never, not even once, interrupted the development of the storyline. Same as with the heroine, several readers complained about the lack of world building. 'It's not dystopian!', they say. Yup, you guessed right - I disagree. We have a mix between contemporary / modern and historical elements. Political structures? Check! The castes, the monarchy' The 'nightmare' world? Check! The huge gap between the privileged (One, Two, Three), the less fortunate (Four, Five, Six) and the unfortunate (Seven, Eight)- I categorized them for you. Is something automatically without depth when it isn't overly complex? No, at least not in my humble opinion. The modern feel to it? Check! You'll notice that right away. No need to explain.The secondary characters, even though the family didn't have a lot of screen page time, coaxed a smile out of me more often than not. Lovely family! America is a daddy's girl. Just like me. Her father was a gentle soul; a wise man. My biggest pre-reading concern was the introduction of the other candidates. I wondered how the author would pull it off. How many? All thirty-four of them? She did a wonderful job by focusing on a couple while the rest floated in the background - present, but not overwhelmingly so.Aspen versus Maxon: No spoilers, no spoilers, no spoilers *chantstoself*. It's a rare occurrence to fall in love (nah, okay, more like a crush) with both male characters. Of course I had a preference, but I'd have been okay with either outcome. However, I was desperate to learn America's final decision. Both Aspen and Maxon had responsibilities; a weight on their shoulders that sometimes felt too heavy to handle. They were proud, too - America stubborn. What an intriguing combination. I thoroughly enjoyed reading about America's life, learning about the Selection and so on before Maxon came into the picture. That Maxon-less time was well spent and necessary.America profited from this experience. It took her a while, but she suddenly saw the Selection process from Maxon's perspective. It wasn't easy for him either. Trust has to be earned and the author took this sentiment to heart. No insta-love, no insta-trust. You cannot imagine how relieved I was.Why not rate the book 5 stars then? The ending was too abrupt. Sorry to say that I didn't like it. It felt cut off rather than 'to be continued'. The author failed to hit the right key. I wanted to almost burst with excitement, not think 'The end? Well, okay then - that kind of s**ks'. A bit more effort could've turned it around. This is something an agent / editor should've realized, for I can absolutely understand how much pressure the author was (or so I imagine) under writing the ending.Are you the mood for a dystopian romance with the dreamy flair of a modern reality television show? If so - this fantastic novel is the book to read. 4.5 stars to The Selection by Kiera Cass.Beware of Spoilers!A few of my favorite quotes for those of you who are interested: 'You can't expect to be able to provide everything for everyone you love.' 'I loved him, and how it felt to be loved by him. I felt special, priceless, irreplaceable.' 'I would be the best of us, the Highest of the Lows. It gave me a sense of purpose.' 'I'm not fighting.

District 13 wants to manipulate and use her to fuel the rebellion. Katniss has had about all that she can stand, but she knows a pawn is only as good as its usefulness. When she sets out to be the Mockingjay, she does it because she feels it is right, but as things go on, she starts to question everyone's motives. District 13 is nothing like she expected and their strict regime and rules are extremely oppressing. Is it really worth it to fight the capital to only pass the chains of bondage to another ""master?""It seems the previous events have finally caught up and we see a much more fragile version of Katniss in this book. When I first read it, I was slightly annoyed at the change in character, but now looking back I can only see it as realistic. The horrors she lived through are not something that you forget easily. They change you, shape you, and eventually break you. Many times Katniss did snap under the pressure, but somehow she still hung on by a thread to her sanity.I was glad to see more of Gale in this book, as I didn't feel a strong connection to him. By the way Katniss described him, he was always strong and rebellious. However, in this book, after seeing District 12 burn before his eyes, his anger becomes a wildfire. He turns into a calculating, detached soldier, who has lost most of his compassion. He truly believes in the phrase ""All's fair in love and war.""  Even Katniss who is a very calculating rather than emotional person doesn't have the ability to kill mindlessly.There rarely is a happy ever after when it comes to war, and this book is no exception. I am glad I waited a few days to review this, my review would have been much different if I hadn't. When I first finished the book, all I felt was despair and anger for the shambles the characters were left in. Now, looking back, everything fits, it all has its purpose. War is not pretty, it is not kind, and it spares no one. Even the ones who survive will be irrevocably altered.I recommend this book, just don't read it expecting a happy ending. It really shows the gritty horrors of war and the knowledge of no matter the outcome, nothing will ever be the same. I would suggest reading the book and then waiting a day or two before making any opinions on it. You will probably find your feelings will change after the despair settles. It definitely did not take the direction I was expecting, but that does not in anyway diminish it. I have a feeling these books will be talked about for years to come.

When it arrived I was even more glad I had picked it - the book is a sort of Christian reference for the important questions and issues people have asked Lucado during his over thirty years of work as a Protestant minister. Lucado answers 172 questions ranging from the nature of heaven to getting out of debt. Each answer is about one page long and includes Bible passages and quotes from other authors where appropriate.I loved the original format and this book is so useful that it is taking up permanent residence on my bookshelves. It's the kind of book I'll go to whenever I'm looking for advice. As I was reading it, I marked three passages to immediately read to friends filled with simple wisdom like ""We are always cleaning up our act"" and ""'Don't talk to me,' we say. 'I'm in a bad mood.'

Gabriel's gift lies with fire. Although sometimes it seems more like a curse as fire is very volatile and difficult to control, and that loss of control comes with serious consequences as he well knows due to the loss of his parents in one of his fires. Despite his immense guilt, Gabriel can't stay away from the fire no matter how hard he tries. This proves even more dangerous than normal when an arsonist starts setting deadly fires and Gabriel becomes the prime suspect. Even his own family thinks he's to blame, leaving him very isolated and alone. The only one who seems to believe him is a girl in his math class named Layne who he feels inexplicably drawn to, but she has her own secrets to keep. Gabriel will have to find a way to fight the fire raging inside him before he loses everything and everyone he has ever cared about.I'll be the first to admit that I wasn't Gabriel's biggest fan in the previous installment. He just seemed to be too quick to anger for my tastes. In all honesty, I felt he was a jerk. However, in Spark, I saw him in a whole new light. Sure, he still is quite the accomplished jerk, and rather nasty to people in general, however, now that I understand him a little better I realize it is all a front to hide his massive insecurities. His element is fire, making him very volatile and really a powder keg ready to explode at any given moment. However, he despises himself for the lack of control he has, further frustrating himself and only adding fuel to the fire. He honestly cannot be described as anything other than severely damaged. Every day is such a struggle for him with his guilt and his desire to change and learn the control that seems forever out of his grasp. To make matters worse, everyone around him seems to think the worst of him, but in their defense, he doesn't exactly make it easy for them to believe in him. However, the further the book went on, the more the tide seemed to change as inch by inch Gabriel started to gain ground, and I was only cheering him on the entire way.Layne is very damaged in her own way, but unlike Gabriel who puts out a very rough exterior, she hides deep within herself, trying to stay unnoticed at all costs. Yet, despite that she has an amazing inner strength of will that rivals Gabriel's even if she doesn't outwardly show it. It really amazed me just how similar they were deep down when you looked past the surface. Appearances definitely can be deceiving, and that definitely holds true here. I think it is that similarity in both strength and damage that really drew them to me as romantic interests. I just felt like they were on rather equal footing, an almost rarity in YA novels, making the romance very sweet and enjoyable. By having both of them damaged, but still incredibly strong, they were able to use their inner strengths to start to heal the other. I really do not think a more perfect match could have been made.As much as I loved Storm, I have to admit that I was a little hesitant to read Spark. I'm a very loyal person character-wise, and I pretty much drag my feet whenever there is a change in character focus as I get so attached to the original ones that I don't want to let go. However after reading Spark, and getting to know Gabriel and Layne, that natural hesitance I have may very well have to change. In all honesty, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I actually may care for them even more than I did for Chris and Becca. So much so, that I wish there would be more focus on them in the future books. But then again, if the series trend is any indication, I'll probably wind up having a new favorite couple by the time I finish the next book. That being said, with this latest installment,  Brigid Kemmerer has fully cemented herself as a heavy hitter in the Paranormal YA genre. Trust me, she will definitely be one to watch out for and I cannot wait to see what is in store next. I highly recommend Spark to anyone who loved Storm as it will definitely rock your socks off.

(In other words, it could have been a lot worse.) There's not much I can say about the story without giving too much away; the action and intrigue that comprised the first two books is still present in Allegiant. Also present is the ensuing romance between Tris and Tobias. Despite having the core elements that made up the first two books, there were a few things that I took issue with in Allegiant...For one, this book is told from the perspectives of both Tris AND Tobias. I was initially very excited about this aspect of the book. However, I just feel that this idea was better in theory. The dual perspective was not executed very well. There was no real distinction between the voices of Tris and Tobias. If you were to open to a random page and read it you would not be able to distinguish who was speaking (except for use of pronouns, names, etc.). I feel that Roth should have spent more time developing a clear voice for Tobias instead of using the same writing style she's used for Tris's voice.I was also a little disappointed about what was &#34;beyond the fence.&#34; Don't get me wrong, it was interesting and thought-provoking, but... I just expected more! I feel like the explanation for the secrets behind Tris's world were just very bland (for lack of a better word). The previous two books were just so mind-blowing that I expected the same sort of pizzaz from Allegiant, but it just wasn't there.Despite these errors, Allegiant really is a decent ending to the trilogy. Even though it doesn't necessarily end the way you want it to. However, its flaws keep it from entering the realm of 5-star books like its predecessors, Divergent and Insurgent.

Read by  Michal Friedman, Ellen Archer, Suzanne Toren, and Robert Petkoff. Then I also took out the hardcover to make sure I didn't miss anything - I didn't.I read this book as a suggestion by a book club. I didn't know much about it, except that ""it's about a child who grew up in one room."", well that doesn't say much. So, I pretty much went in blind.At the start of the book, it was devastatingly sad. Heartachingly sad. So unbelievably sad. Is there a strong word then SAD? Because I need it! Everything that this poor little boy does not know in the world and all he has to suffer through. Part of the reason it's SOOO AWFUL is because he doesn't REALIZE just how AWFUL it is!Slightly less then half of the book is the mom, ""Ma"", and her son ""Jack"" being stuck in a 11' by 11' garden shed, transformed into a prison with no escape, no windows. They're ""lucky"" to have electricity, heat, skylight, and a TV. But they're completely disconnected from the outside world by ""Old Nick"" who kidnapped ""ma"" 7 years prior, to use as his sex slave in this room. Their only connection to the outside is Old Nick, who brings groceries, takes out the trash and gives them ""sunday treat"" (when they need extra things). But they have NO HUMAN interaction with the outside world. And in fact, Jack doesn't even know there is an outside, until he turns 5, and Ma concocts a plan to help them escape.For a 5 year old, Jack is pretty smart. And Ma, despite having to give birth to and raise this baby on her own, does a pretty good job of having things for them to do and learn. But still, this disconnection is killing her. She can't even see a dentist or run ,or anything.**SPOILER ALERT FROM THIS POINT ON**The second half of the book is what happens after their escape. You see the stark contrast of life in this tiny room to the BIG OUTSIDE WORLD. You see Jack trying to get used to seeing ""all these persons in REAL LIFE"". Stuff that we encounter every day, like stairs, are troublesome for the youngster. So many things that we do every day - open doors, toilets, and walking outside in the rain, are strange, new and sometimes scary to little Jack.You also see the crazy media hype that surrounds their Return to Civilization, and of course Ma's return to her own family. She said at one point, as she apologized to Jack, that She's trying to not only teach him the WORLD, but she's also trying to learn who she WAS before she was kidnapped.The writing in this book is Great. Really good story telling. Jack's voice (Michal) and Ma's voice (Ellen) were PERFECT, spot ON. I couldn't have imagined them any better if I could choose the narrators myself! I liked that they used several people in the story to read it - good move! Also, i did notice that in the beginning Jack's voice was a bit high pitched for a child, almost doll-like, but at the end of the story it lowered a little bit. He was still 5 years old, but there was more of an adult tone on there. Don't know if that was done intentionally.I loved the grandparents and how ODD it must be to ""have their little girl back"" after all this time, thinking she was dead. I am very happy that the author spent more than HALF of the book concentrating on what happens after they're free, thereby contrasting with their capture. I also love that they DID visit their old room after all! So good to have this circular sort of conclusion.So all in all the book was very well written. I can't say I ""enjoyed"" it because it was devastating to hear, but I was certainly worthwhile!!My only gripe with the book - the reason I didn't give it all 5 stars - is because the breastfeeding that Ma does despite Jack's age felt totally unbelievable. Everything was super believable - the room, the kidnap, Jack - except for the breastfeeding. She never did explain WHY she did this even to a 5 year old - perhaps so that she would not get pregnant again (I'm not certain about this fact), but the fact that it was NOT explained, no REASON is what added to it being unbelievable.Other then that, it's a really good story of survival and hope.I recommend it!

I was fortunate to receive an advanced copy of Louise Penny's latest mystery novel ""How the Light Gets In"", the ninth in the series about Chief Inspector Armand Gamache and the Homicide Division of the Surete du Quebec. I had already reserved a hard copy for the book's August 2013 release date because this is one author  I buy in hardcover; the better to savor her writing.  This truly gifted author has the ability to make you FEEL - so much so, that this is almost more novel than mystery - although there are three compelling mysteries entwined in this latest book.In talking about this book, Ms. Penny says ""My books are about terror. That brooding terror curled deep down inside us.  But more than that, more than murder, more than all the rancid emotions and actions, my books are about goodness.  And kindness.  About choices."" I guarantee she will make you feel all this and so much more.  She will bring you to the edge of your seat, make your heart pound in anticipation and ache as you feel the suffering of her always well-constructed characters. Because she also lets you feel hope and joy, the struggle between the light and the dark is that much more vivid.This book opens as Christmas approaches and the author deftly portrays the joy and anticipation of the season played off against the sadness as Gamache's elite squad is dismantled and scattered while unscrupulous forces are at work in the Surete. Who will settle for nothing less than Gamache's destruction? and that of his next in charge Jean-Guy Belavoir? A terrible alliance that has been 30 years in the making will once again bring evil into the heart of the tiny village of Three Pines and threaten all that the inhabitants hold dear.To those who have read all the previous books in the Chief Inspector Gamache series, you will not be disappointed, as her writing somehow is brought to an even higher level, her plots are even more complex, her characters more finely drawn.  We know these people and we care about them; we feel with them.I highly recommend this book, but if you find yourself curled up in your chair, unable to stop reading far into the night, remember you were warned....

It changed the way I view love and gave me more tolerance and open-mindedness. I'm not at all saying I agree with that type of relationship, but I'd be lying if I said it didn't make me wish someone loved me with the same kind of power that Lochan and Maya loved each other, and their family. I connected on so many different levels to the characters in this book. I cried each time Lochan was forced to face his social anxieties because I too have felt some of those same things!! I could also feel both his and Maya's devotion to the kids, and feel their suffering as well. I could feel their wore out, tired frustrations and their joy as if it were my own.I HATED the ending!

Though I totally understand that Lochan's love of family was so incredibly powerful that it left him no other choice, still it seems so unfair. Unfair to the kids, unfair to Maya, and unfair to the reader.The author, Tabitha Suzama did a fantastic job making these characters as real as real can be and making me feel as if I were in their place. I don't believe she could have ever pulled this  off if she hadn't written it in first person from both Lochan's and Maya's point of view.This book truly epitomizes the saying: don't judge a man until you've walked a mile in his shoes.

With every book she has published, I swear she can't possibly get any better, could not possibly top herself. And yet she does. Every. Single. Book. is better than the last. And that says a lot considering her first book was Slammed. I mean, seriously?? How does she do it? I am in complete awe. I say it every time, I know I do, but my admiration and respect of this author has reached New heights.Hopeless was a phenomenal book. The story was heartbreaking... the story of Hope/Sky and her life literally broke me. The love story between Sky and Holder was a beautiful one, undeniably so. But Losing Hope just took all my love for this story and multiplied it exponentially.First off, we met Dean Holder again but we get to know him in a whole new way. A way that makes me love him even more than I thought I already had. His telling of his sister's suicide was possibly the most heart wrenching depiction of a suicide I've ever read. Suicide is always tragic, of course... But unless you've lived through that kind of personal loss, I think we take the depth of this kind of tragedy for granted. Well Colleen Hoover takes you there. Dean's story shredded me. I found the entire story line surrounding Les... Her childhood, her utter hopelessness, her subsequent death... I found it almost more heart breaking than Sky's story. It just struck a chord with me this time around that I will never get over. Colleen Hoover really nails you in the gut with Les' suicide, it's agonizing to think of what lead Les to this place of feeling absolutely nothing anymore and her willingness to give it all up. I could taste Dean's feeling of hopelessness, of second guessing everything he could have said or done differently to save his sister from something that seems so preventable but in reality, was near impossible to save her from. I felt every ounce of anger he felt toward her about what she left behind, his anger toward her for what he and her family were left to deal with, the pain that never went away. And the letters... the letters made me laugh, cry, get angry... they were perfect. They kept Les alive in her absence, they created this amazing dynamic within the story that would have been virtually impossible to achieve any other way. We got to know Les, we grew to know the relationship between the siblings through these letters, we felt the range of Dean's emotions through his writing. It was just a perfect element that added so much to this book.Getting to relive the love story between Sky and Dean again was an amazing thing... But there's just something magical about getting it all from Dean's point of view. All those blanks filled in, all those stones unturned. You just get the whole package with a sequel from the other partner's perspective and it really gives you completion and satisfaction and closure that the love you know Sky felt for Dean is reciprocated tenfold. But knowing what Dean felt for Sky, what he felt for Hope, and knowing the pain he had lived with for years in between literally stole my breath away. It's a miracle this guy came out of all that he endured... all that he carried on his shoulders since he was practically a toddler, really. Yes, Hope disappeared when they were five. But he was her rock for years before that, just holding the pinky of the sad little girl next door. And with Losing Hope, you're treated to this amazing miracle of how he felt finding her again and how truly miraculous it is that his love for Hope and his love for Sky were both independent from each other, but yet undeniably connected. It's as if no matter where Hope went, had she never even gone anywhere, or whether or not Hope did or didn't end up as Sky, Dean Holder was meant to love her.This story is so layered. I'm still sitting here trying to get my chin off the floor as I go over and over the web that Colleen Hoover has woven with this book. The links between these characters, no matter how separated they thought they had become, how lost they believed they were to each other... their lives were so tied up in each other. Aside from the obvious, that Dean and Sky lived within miles of each other without ever knowing so, so much about how severely their lives overlapped, how one's decisions and choices and actions effected the others without ever consciously knowing it... it's absolutely awe inspiring to think about what Ms Hoover created here. Brilliant is really the only word I can use and I still don't believe that does the book justice. You live this book.I think too often an author attempts to retell a story from the male perspective and it becomes a story of cut and paste. You come out of it feeling like you just reread a story you already knew. This book is like reading an entirely different story. You think you know this story, you think you know the plot because you read Hopeless... You believe you know these characters and their story of how it began, how it ended and everything in between. But here's a bomb... You know nothing. You know nothing until the very last page of Losing Hope, when you finally have all the pieces, the completed puzzle... You have closure, you find peace with this story. You learn forgiveness in this book, you regain hope. This book is amazing. This book is a masterpiece of epic proportions.

I enjoyed the complexity of the plots, the character development, the multiple perspectives, the detailed worlds, the unconventional blur between good/evil and the unpredictable plot twists. There is much in this book to enjoy and praise.That said I only gave this book 3 stars because it left me feeling, well, kind of disturbed. Multiple times, during the course of reading this book, I told whoever was around that I felt like I was being emotionally abused by the author. I usually like disturbing/dark stories but something about this one troubled me. For starters the sex and sexual violence in this book was a bit much for me. Almost all the sex scenes are about a thirteen year old child. The sexual acts that happen to Dany in this novel constitute at least a dozen felonies in any civilized society. Not only could I not discern a reason the author had to make Dany SO young (especially if he wanted her character to be highly sexualized) but the aspects of sex he chose to discribe and the manner in which he discribed them were random, weird and came across as nothing more than a perverted indulgence. I would read something and simultaneously roll my eyes while feeling an icky shudder up and down my spine. I have no problems with sex in books I read, but the manner in which the sex scenes were written in this book are not reflective of real life and left me feeling grossed out. They felt exploitive I guess because they were so gratutious and strange.Also, as a women, the constant rape and violence towards women was hard to read. I realize rape and misogyny are part of the world, particularly in times of war, but the amount and detail was hard to stomach. While the male characters (good and bad) generally die or get injured bravely in battle the women must be systemically humiliated before dying unceremoniously. Not only is raping them bad enough, they must be gang raped. And just in case gang rape wasn't degrading enough they have to be gang raped from behind. This combined with the constant womanizing of the main characters, the constant put downs related to the worth of women relative to men and after a while it makes you start to wonder; has Martin created a world filled with systemic female degradation because he is laying the foundation for an ultimate commentary on oppression, violence and human dignity? Or has he created a world filled with female degradation because that is what he likes writing about? I have 6 more books to read before I can answer that question but I have a suspicion it is the latter which is where the icky feeling I have towards this book comes from. Hopefully, it turns out I am wrong.Even though this book left a bad taste in my mouth in some respects, I will continue to read the series because it is wildly entertaining.

Gabriel's gift lies with fire. Although sometimes it seems more like a curse as fire is very volatile and difficult to control, and that loss of control comes with serious consequences as he well knows due to the loss of his parents in one of his fires. Despite his immense guilt, Gabriel can't stay away from the fire no matter how hard he tries. This proves even more dangerous than normal when an arsonist starts setting deadly fires and Gabriel becomes the prime suspect. Even his own family thinks he's to blame, leaving him very isolated and alone. The only one who seems to believe him is a girl in his math class named Layne who he feels inexplicably drawn to, but she has her own secrets to keep. Gabriel will have to find a way to fight the fire raging inside him before he loses everything and everyone he has ever cared about.I'll be the first to admit that I wasn't Gabriel's biggest fan in the previous installment. He just seemed to be too quick to anger for my tastes. In all honesty, I felt he was a jerk. However, in Spark, I saw him in a whole new light. Sure, he still is quite the accomplished jerk, and rather nasty to people in general, however, now that I understand him a little better I realize it is all a front to hide his massive insecurities. His element is fire, making him very volatile and really a powder keg ready to explode at any given moment. However, he despises himself for the lack of control he has, further frustrating himself and only adding fuel to the fire. He honestly cannot be described as anything other than severely damaged. Every day is such a struggle for him with his guilt and his desire to change and learn the control that seems forever out of his grasp. To make matters worse, everyone around him seems to think the worst of him, but in their defense, he doesn't exactly make it easy for them to believe in him. However, the further the book went on, the more the tide seemed to change as inch by inch Gabriel started to gain ground, and I was only cheering him on the entire way.Layne is very damaged in her own way, but unlike Gabriel who puts out a very rough exterior, she hides deep within herself, trying to stay unnoticed at all costs. Yet, despite that she has an amazing inner strength of will that rivals Gabriel's even if she doesn't outwardly show it. It really amazed me just how similar they were deep down when you looked past the surface. Appearances definitely can be deceiving, and that definitely holds true here. I think it is that similarity in both strength and damage that really drew them to me as romantic interests. I just felt like they were on rather equal footing, an almost rarity in YA novels, making the romance very sweet and enjoyable. By having both of them damaged, but still incredibly strong, they were able to use their inner strengths to start to heal the other. I really do not think a more perfect match could have been made.As much as I loved Storm, I have to admit that I was a little hesitant to read Spark. I'm a very loyal person character-wise, and I pretty much drag my feet whenever there is a change in character focus as I get so attached to the original ones that I don't want to let go. However after reading Spark, and getting to know Gabriel and Layne, that natural hesitance I have may very well have to change. In all honesty, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I actually may care for them even more than I did for Chris and Becca. So much so, that I wish there would be more focus on them in the future books. But then again, if the series trend is any indication, I'll probably wind up having a new favorite couple by the time I finish the next book. That being said, with this latest installment,  Brigid Kemmerer has fully cemented herself as a heavy hitter in the Paranormal YA genre.

Sometimes when I read things that are emotionally heavy, I just have a hard time removing myself from the emotions. But I finally got the book from the library because I didn't want to spend money on a book that I was hesitant to read in the first place. The story begins on Jack's fifth birthday and then goes on to tell the story of Jack and ""Ma"" who are being held prisoner by ""Old Nick"" in an 11 x 11 square foot room. The reader spends many days with Jack and Ma and learn that Ma gave birth to Jack while being held captivity in Room. It is clear that Ma has tried to educate Jack with the many stories she knows along with the television, but in order to protect Jack, she leads him to believe that the world is only Room and outside the door is outerspace. He thinks that what he sees on television isn't real and that only Ma, Old Nick and him are ""real"". 5 year old Jack is the narrator of the story and he calls everything in the room by its noun as if it were the name. For example...""We move Table over to beside Bath so we can sunbathe on Rug right under Skyligt when it's extra warm."" Ma is creative in trying to fill the days with activities with very little actual things...Phys Ed by running around the room or jumping on the bed, Parrot by repeating what was just said on TV, crafts with used toilet paper tubes, spaghetti, and old egg shells. Jack only sees Old Nick from his sleepint place in ""Wardrobe"" and doesn't undertstand the situation they are in. Finally, after some questioning, Ma tells Jack the truth that what he sees on TV is actually real and there is a whole world out there that they are missing and comes up with an escape plan. I don't want to say much else to avoid spoilers.There was so much hype around this book, especially with Jaycee Dugard coming into the news. I had very high expectations for this book, but they weren't met. At first it is interesting to have the story told in the voice of Jack but after a few chapters it becomes quite tedious. I got very tired of everything being named and the writing became dull. I started to skim quite a bit in places so I just got the gist of what was happening in the story. Like many other reviewers, I had a hard time believing that a child who could use words such as omnivore and quinoa and could do square roots had such poor grammar and speaking abilities. For example he said he got hurted instead of he got hurt. Ma did correct his grammar sometimes but for someone who worked so hard to educate him, it definitely was a deviation for her not to help him speak correctly. The escape plan was pretty unbelievable as well as the reast of the story. We were unable to learn much of Ma's phsychological state or the details of Ma's abduction and her life before Jack because of the limitations of having Jack as a narrator. There were other parts of the plotline dealing with Ma that were just skimmed and I would like to have read more about Ma's thoughts and experiences. It would have been nice to switch narrator at different times to get more detail.All and all, I am glad that I got the book from the library and didn't spend money on it. The hype around this book was just hype, the book left a lot to desire. The book was ok but if you want to read about the psychological impact of abduction and captivity, this is not the book. You would be better off reading a true crime story of an actual account these crimes. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3497, 3511)",5,0.0,False

Although I knew that I would not be as blown away by it as he was (my dad spends most of his time reading emails, not novels, and he's a computer geek), I knew I had to see whether the novel lived up to the hype. And now that I've read it, I can say that the majority of it did. The real meat of the story--the main mystery--is quite the thrill ride, and I found it pretty impossible to guess who the ""culprit"" was until the end. I loved Salander and her various methods of getting information or making things work to her advantage. Blomkvist was a little blah at times, but that didn't really hinder the novel very much--he provided a pretty good contrast to Salander's unpredictability.However, the mystery is framed by this financial libel disaster that Blomkist got himself into, and, consequently, I found the beginning and end of the novel to be very boring. While I was largely able to ignore Larsson's often excessive amount of detail for the bulk of the book (some of which became relevant later, others which were really not necessary), I had to force myself through the first 75 pages or so of detail and financial crap that was relevant to Blomkvist's life, but entirely irrelevant to the rest of the book. I suppose it is better that Larsson fleshed out the context rather than just throwing it in as a wimpy reasoning for why Blomkvist could spend a year on this mystery, but, honestly, I have little interest in the financial world.But, while this boring frame (and maybe it was just boring to me) made the novel a bit less enjoyable, the bulk of it is much more applicable to a college age girl (at times terrifyingly so), and is also far more graphic, shocking, gruesome, and totally gripping. As a warning, though, it does get pretty gross at times, and I had a hard time falling asleep a couple nights after reading this. So you may not want to read The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo right before going to sleep, but if you like mysteries or thrillers, or are just looking for a hold-onto-your-pants ride of a novel, do read it.

His potential public is large as the subject matter could interest de facto everybody:  how come that snap judgements, taken intuitively, often seem to render better results than decisions based on more-informed and very rational reflections?Gladwell is a gifted speaker and this is reflected in his writing style whereby the reader is directly addressed, questions are posed and the attention is grabbed by revealing examples: E.g.  it can be disconcerting to know that an experienced observer can predict with an uncanny high probability if a marriage will last or end in a divorce and this by simply overhearing (and analysing) a short conversation between both partners; `priming experiments' show that the mere use of words associated with old age made the  participants in the test walk slower...These are only two of the examples given,  the book provides quite a lot of very interesting anecdotes to surprise people on boring cocktail parties.The book has undoubtedly entertainment value and Gladwell keeps the readers interested, but more seriously now, what message does he want to transmit?Gladwell illustrates that conscious decisions made on basis of a lot of information are oftentimes not better than `snap decisions' which are taken fast and unconsciously. Most people do find it hard to accept that these snap judgements, this `rapid recognition' based on mysterious, unknown rules, do have value.More problematic is that these snap judgements can be prone to error as well and this due to the fact that in certain circumstances the use of stereotypes and implicit associations does lead to wrong conclusions. People can be manipulated, first impressions (e.g. judging somebody purely on appearance) can be thwarted. People are not always aware of this. Especially in cases where people are confronted with something completely new, first impressions are not that helpful, but rather confounding. However experience can help, the intelligent user of this unconscious decision-making process is aware of all these drawbacks and can use snap judgements in a controlled, efficient way.Gladwell knows how to tell his story, however what I did not like that much is his use of a very specific `technical vocabulary' whereby he wants to make a compromise between scientific concepts and popular terminology resulting in words such as `thin-slicing', `the mystery of the locked door' and titles and subtitles tending to hyperbole (e.g. the subtitle of the book: The Power of Thinking without Thinking).Calling Gladwell `one of the world's most original thinkers' (mentioned on the cover of my paperback-edition) is of course a gross exaggeration, however `Blink' is a fascinating read on an interesting subject and it offers quite some startling examples. The most important lesson that I have drawn from this book is that intuition is something which can be helpful, can be trained (the protestant work-ethic which one can also find in other books of Gladwell, e.g. in `Outliers') and adds a valid approach to solve problems, supplementing a purely logical, conventional method. The lesson is that we are not always better off by gathering more information.What lingers on as well, by the myriad of sometimes very intriguing examples - and this probably less intended by the writer - is the observation how fascinating and manipulation-prone beings we are.

This is bolstered by the book's subtitle: ""A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything."" Despite the outward appearance of some rebellious, glamorous edge, this bold claim hardly seems appropriate given the book's tone. It's rather going out on a limb to describe Steven Levitt as a ""rogue economist"" simply because he entertains the idea of studying sumo wrestlers under the umbrella of economics. In my opinion, this is not a totally zany idea, as the issue he studies clearly falls under game theory, itself a social science that applies heavily to business and the economy. Anyway, as far as I can tell, Levitt uses his skill to assess social constructs, and the underlying changes that produced them. Is this, as the book would suggest, being a ""rogue economist?"" I guess, if your only criteria for distributing the ""rogue"" label relies on the reassignment of focus (social instead of financial processes) -- not the employment of independent or non-mainstream theories.In addition, the title ""Freakonomics"" is also misleading. You might get the impression, before reading it, that because of the title, ""Freakonomics"" boldly enters uncharted territory in economic theory, using groundbreaking new methodology to shine an ultraviolet light on the seemy underbelly of modern life. Well, sort of. It shows us some interesting things, but I'd hardly call it a revelatory or groundbreaking methodology. Levitt is probably a gifted guy with stats, but when you boil it down he simply takes data, applies a standard statistical theory to it, and extracts findings. Not to shortchange him, but the results aren't ""freaky"" in any way. I think it would be fair to say that most other accomplished staticians would come to the same conclusions he does, given the same data. What Levitt has going for him is the subject matter he's interested in, which may be fortuitous for us as readers, but it seems preposterous to suggest that the science itself is any more wacky or freaky, which is what the title seems to be suggesting.My girlfriend accuses me of being overly sensitive to these points, and feels that I'm overlooking the content based on a feeling that I've somehow been lied to with regards to the title. Is this an accurate assessment? Well, I did fork out $25 for this book, so naturally, when I'm told that a ""rogue economist"" (ooh, how exciting!) is going to tell me about the ""hidden side of everything,"" based on a mysterious and tantalizing scientific phenomenon described as ""freakonomics"" I naturally expect something different than this. Not to say that what I got wasn't good, it just wasn't as engaging or revelatory as what I would have expected, and maybe more to the point, it did not help me build any economic intuitions. There was little to nothing in this book that I could use in any fashion in my life, aside from very specific statistics that are really only useful as trivia. The idea of there being a secret, hither-to-unknown concept called ""freakonomics"" that was the silent engine of the economic cosmos dissolved to dust the second I reached the last page. There simply was no theory that I might apply to my daily life somehow. No tidbits of economic, psychological, or behavioral knowledge that could somehow, in some way, be useful in an applied setting, which was extremely disappointing.As entertaining and as full of fun, interesting information as it is, Freakonomics felt surprisingly skimpy on meaningful content. It's a good-- if short-- read, and it more than likely contains information that I'll find myself reciting to friends and pondering over, but I can't help but walk away feeling like it's a half-finished book. By its own admission, there is no unifying theme to the chapters, and no particular purpose to its order. There's a sense of pointlessness and lack of cohesion that makes the book crumble under the weight of its own lofty pretensions-- or at least the ones put on it by the publisher's marketing department.

And the process, to reconnect you with your God-sized purpose and potential.""Steven Furtick writes this book to challenge us to see the immense power of God and to claim it in our own lives and ministries.  Expounding Biblical principles of audacious prayer from the story of Joshua praying for the sun to stand still in the midst of battle, Furtick shows that God is waiting for us to ask Him to do incredible things ... but too often we don't believe God can really help us.Along with solid Biblical insight, Furtick weaves powerful stories (many from his personal life) about praying audacious prayers and seeing God answer.  At a very young age (I think he is still under 30), Furtick planted the Elevation Church in Charlotte NC.  In about 4 years, this church has become one of the fastest growing, most influential churches in America, with over 6, 000 in attendance.  As I said, he has prayed for miracles and has seen miracles happen.Sun Stand Still is not a heavy theology book.  It is an easy read that is written for the church audience at large (not just church leadership.

I laughed, I bawled my eyes out, and even got angry. So many feelings that I wasn&#8217;t expecting.Pushing the Limits was so much more than a romance story. While the romance was smoking hot, I have to say I enjoy learning more about Noah and Echo as characters and seeing them overcome their struggles more than the romance. Both Echo and Noah are very trouble characters and have dark secrets they have kept buried inside. Katie McGarry was not afraid of tackling the nitty gritty and serious issues, which I really liked. She was able to capture the emotional struggles Echo and Noah were facing so well that I was in tears for these poor, poor characters.Normally I am not a fan of alternating points of view, one of the characters always seem to come off as weaker or it just does nothing for the plot, but in the case of Pushing the Limits the alternating point of view worked perfectly. I loved getting into both Echo and Noah&#8217;s head. The writing helped create these characters who you come to care about and get emotionally attached to. Katie McGarry wrote these fabulous characters and as a reader you were truly was able to get into each of their heads. When a chapter ended and switched characters it didn&#8217;t feel awkward, the story flowed and it didn&#8217;t feel like head jumping (thankfully!).Now Noah and Echo, man, I just wanted to give them a hug. And boy, do they need one. Noah is the boy everyone warns their daughters against, but he&#8217;s so much more. While he has the tough, bad boy exterior, Noah is one of the most caring, motivated, strong teenagers I&#8217;ve seen. Despite all the struggles he&#8217;s had to face, like losing his parents and growing up in foster care, he&#8217;s extremely dedicated to his two brothers who have been separated from him. Noah&#8217;s devotion to his younger brothers, oh god. It was the sweetest thing. The scenes with Noah and his brothers made me tear up so much, I&#8217;m not afraid to say it. He loves them so much and will do anything for them. Noah gives everything to those he loves and will do anything to protect those he loves, such an admirable trait. I loved that aspect of his personality so much. I loved how he grew as a character over book.And then there is Echo. That poor poor girl. She definitely has it rough. Her father is overprotective and overbearing, she is not allowed to see her mother because of an event Echo cannot remember but left her with horrible scars over her arms. Despite everything, Echo still wants to remember the horrible event that almost killed her and still cares for her mother. Her struggle to learn the truth about that night was hard to read. All she wanted was to know. When she finally learns the truth, I was in tears with her. Like Noah, she grew so much over the story. She was willing to come to terms with what happen and open up to those around her, thanks to Noah. While they might be the two messed up character ever, they were so adorable and perfect together.The romance in this book was electric. Noah and Echo&#8217;s chemistry jumped off the page and you couldn&#8217;t help but want them to be together. They needed to be together for each other. But the romance did not define this book. Yes, it might be how they market it, what with the cover and all but it was so much more. The emotional struggles in the book are what really made me love it. The romance was a nice bonus.If you read one book this year, it definitely should be Pushing the Limits. Its such a great read that captivates you with its amazing characters and draws you in with their struggles. I&#8217;m super excited to see what Katie McGarry writes next because she has me next. A companion book staring a secondary character for this book is being published so I&#8217;m super excited for that! Hands down, Pushing the Limit is a must read.P.S.

I'm not, structly speaking, a bestseller person. I love Anna Karenina, Unbearable Lightness of Being and In the Garden of Beasts. I can be a little stuck up when it comes to pop culture fiction. But this summer when I had a long recovery from surgery ahead of me, a friend recommended this book. I didn't even know what it was about. I was just in a hurry so I bought it.So glad I did! What a fun vacation of a read. I was not looking for scorching erotica or a send-up of classic British romance novels. But this is both. I loooooved the fact that Ana's voice is so naive and genuine. I liked that she had that geeky ""Oh my""habit. I loved the fact that her shock at her own sexuality caused her shamefaced embarassment. I even liked that she awkwardly fumbled around with the language of sex. It lent authenticity and humor to her voice. So many novels of all kinds swoon around in the language of perfume ads when it comes to love and sex. No cliche ""throbbing members"" or ""heaving breasts"" here - but the wackily named ""apex of the thighs."" Once Sex and the City happened, we all knew the sexually savvy twentysomething and thirtysomething unleashed on the Manhattan single scene. This is a different voice and another strong point of view.The cinematic way James captures moment to moment life between the two lead characters is fresh and interesting. It is almost like watching closeups move from one character to another. She captures the way communication and emotions flicker across the face and change suddenly on the mention of a word or even on a look. It is a very visual book and I think that is one of the reasons why it captures such a huge audience now. We are used to images and film editing. I think she masters that here. The variety is not in exotic word choice, but in the way the moments move across the page.I also loved the character of Christian. He was over the top and too much from his first appearance in the book. Even Ana sees that he is way too full of himself. I like the way he slowly begins to laugh about himself. This is a very real phenomenon. Love and acceptance make it easier to laugh at our greatest flaws and vulnerabilities. I think it is cool that James successfully wrote somebody very sexy AND ridiculous. Almost both at the same time.The email part of the courtship was one of my favorite aspects of this story. Both characters revealed more in their email, opened up more. Their exchanges had real immediacy to them. They brought to mind the witty banter that characters have in older comedies like Philadelphia Story. I know, I realize PS is a masterpiece and I am not saying this is a masterpiece, but there was that quick witted repartee.The sex is obviously there and it is a mix. Sometimes those scenes are over the top fantasy and soemtimes they are sweet or intimate. I think James like Christian is at her best in building anticipation. This is not a two animals mating in a jungle type book, nor a series of slick acrobatics - thank goodness. It circles around the thrill of what will happen next plus a little threat of danger. It was interesting to get a peek into one version of the BDSM lifestyle.I imagine that in ""erotic fiction"" readers are happy with lots of imaginative sex scenes. James' attempt at psychological layering, while flawed, was also highly ehgaging and takes the book beyond the sex angle. Nor did she have to bring us ""our time"" in such ringing vivid color but the books, wine, music, food, Seattle skyline, etc made this a full world for me. I also love the fantasy of the billionaire that she brings with the helicopter, plane, glider, boat, fancy dinners, gorgeous houses, cars, etc. I mean why not? In the times we are in now, escape to such a fantasy lifestyle is a cool breeze in a hot room.Finally - when I read the reviews at first, this was a big five star read. Now the naysayers are having their day, and I read some of their reviews and am a bit perplexed. When you pick up Fifty Shades, you are stopping by for a great pizza. You shouldn't look at your plate and expect lobster or endive. Pizza is gooey, delicious, and a little bit bad for you. And a lot of fun. Just like this book!

I have a degree in economics with graduate work and 25+ years on Wall Street. Brad Thor has told a great story and weaved into it the perils the country faces as the Federal Reserve (as ""Federal"" as Federal Express) is not at all ""Federal"" and has no ""Reserves"" and will fight for its existence. Did it have a time and place? Yes, surely. But it has no regulatory agency oversight, arrogantly refuses or deflects from direct questions at hearings, and for years has benefited from those tossing out ""Black Helicopter Loons"" to dismiss it's critics when it has been discussed.The Fed is a club. It was created in secret and it operates in secret (""Hidden Order delves into this in detail) with no intentions at all of being transparent or being reigned in. Instead of fixing the systemic issues it brought about from the years of easy money by Greenspan, this stooge Bernanke, along with Turbo-Tax Timmy, bailed out all their powerful friends. But don't let Bush off the hook as Hank Paulson, via the Goldman Sachs revolving door into Fed and Treasury policy, diverted the TARP funds to pay premiums for pure junk to their pals, not the American people who are still hurting.It's a wonderful read and an informative read. Mr. Thor has been appearing on more shows than any author I have seen of late and this book should be a real eye-opener for those who thought we are on the right track because the train is speeding and barely holding the rails thanks to this clandestine group that tacks on more-and-more debt that even our grand children will be burdened by. The Fed needs to be stopped and this awareness Mr. Thor brings to the people in this thriller is a good start for the common man. I already have seen and fully understood the points in the book due to education and working on the street. Now the general public has an great read and an education to go with it. Thank you Mr. Thor. A job well done...kudosP.S. And on the day of its release Bernanke issued a statement: ""Highly accommodative monetary policy for the foreseeable future is what's needed in the U.S. economy."" The stock market was looking vulnerable, interest rates were rising, and that affects profits. The club can't have that so the taxpayer funded bailouts will continue. The Fed MUST be audited and reigned in. And you'll understand why when you read this book! ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2441, 2455)",1,0.0,False
