Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird is very much discussed in this book and used as an example, perhaps a bit too strongly. But anyone who has read To Kill a Mockingbird understands why that book and the message it portrays is so very important and makes the reader aware of both the light and darkness that resides in all our souls.This idea of light and dark is the main focus in Beautiful Creatures. Nothing is gray, but very much black and white and told from the point of view from Ethan Wate, a sixteen- year old who lives with his father in the small town of Gatlin, South Carolina. Ethan's father is a writer who locks himself up in his study for days on end. Not only to write his literary masterpiece, but to hide from Ethan and the loss of Ethan's mother who only just died in a car accident. Because of Ethan's parents influence, he enjoys reading and not just comic books but literary classics such as Cather in the Rye and Slaughterhouse-Five.Ethan has learned early on that there are two types of people in Gaitlin, as his father states- ""The ones who are bound to stay or too dumb to go. Everyone else finds a way out."" Ethan wants a way out. He has little over two more years until he can leave Gatlin. He's sick of the people that live there; those that live in the past still, where the remnants of the Civil War are alive and well. There are no surprises in Gatlin that is until a new resident arrives. Her name is Lena Duchannes and the one Ethan has been waiting all his life for. Ethan has been having strange dreams about a mysterious girl and coincidently it is Lena, the niece of Old Man Macon Ravenwood, a recluse who makes, ""Boo Radley look like a social butterfly"". Macon lives in a run-down plantation, one of the oldest in town. The student's at Ethan's high school decide early on that Lena is a freak because of her family ties. The boys think Lena is beautiful and mysterious, but because a few of Ethan's female classmates, who are blonde haired, tanned and a fashionable, treat Lena as an outcast because she wears long dresses, black Converse sneakers and has dark curls. Both her parents are dead and she also drives the family hearse. Ethan is smitten the moment he sees her because of the connection they have.Around the time Lena arrives, strange things start to happen. A song about sixteen moons and sixteen years plays on Ethan's IPOD, one he has never heard of and vanishes as soon as he listens to it. The weather becomes unpredictable and whenever Lena is in a room the windows shatter. Lena soon has a reputation of being a witch and Ethan wants to get to the heart of the matter and find out who Lena is and why he can't get her out of his mind. Ethan is much like a dog after a bone and tries to befriend Lena, even though she warns him to stay away. What these two don't know is they both have a bond and need each other. They find out that their ancestors are responsible for a curse, and because of that Lena doesn't have much time. Lena comes from a line of powerful relatives. She is known as a Caster, a gifted individual who has powers. Her Uncle Macon, as well as her grandmother and cousins do also. Lena feels she is living on borrowed time because in less than six months she turns sixteen and on her sixteenth birthday she will be claimed, where her fate is chosen and she will either become dark or light. That means Lena's free will has been taken from her. She's not meant to live among mortals and that means Ethan. If Lena goes dark, just like her cousin Ridley, she must leave her home and family because bad things will continue to happen if she remains.Time is of the essence and Ethan won't let Lena go. He will find a way to stop fate and figure out a way to make sure Lena doesn't go dark. They must find a book of magic, the answer to breaking a one-hundred fifty year old curse, and stop the Gatlin community at large from their vendetta they have against Lena. There are many dark forces at play and lines will be drawn. And Ethan's love for Lena may not be strong enough to save her.Kami and Margaret deserve many accolades for penning such a tale like Beautiful Creatures. At over six-hundred pages this is a long, rich story that may seem slow moving, but it does fit the tone of the way of life in the south. Magic, love and suspense are all combined to create a tension filled world with very unique and eccentric characters.Ethan and Lena are lovely together and I really couldn't find any fault with their relationship and feelings for one another. Ethan may seem a bit too good to be true, but he has a great voice and the reader can see things perfectly through his eyes even though his actual physical description is a bit vague. Ethan may seem to be a typical teenage with ripped jeans, t-shirts, messy room, and love of basketball but underneath is the heart of a poet, a mature person who has grown old before his time because of his environment and lack of parental guidance. Ethan does has a grandmother type in his life, his housekeeper the mystical Amma, but Ethan's father is a very pale and lacking character, unlike Lena's family who comes across much like the Addams Family.Because of these eccentric relatives of Lena's to the opinions and ideas of the Gatlin people, I felt at times it was a bit too much and overwhelming. Ethan's best friend Wesley ""Link"" Lincoln has a mother who should be a force to be reckoned with but is a bit too cartoonish, much like mustached twirling like villain. The reason for Mrs. Lincoln's annoying personality is unveiled at the end but at that point I wanted to push her off a cliff. Also, the last fifty pages or so became a whirlwind reading experience. My head starting spinning from all the action occurring. Beautiful Creatures would have been a near perfect read for me if not for the final fight for Lena's life.Even thought I felt the actions of some of the characters too comical and the message of social acceptance and harmony Kami and Margaret were trying to get across was a bit too strong a times, Beautiful Creatures is an incredible book. Lessons are learned within these pages and that simple message that love conquers all rings true. The power of love and hope is very much a universal belief in life and in Beautiful Creatures.Katiebabs ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(6523, 6537)",1,0.0,False

It&#8217;s very rare a book makes me laugh out loud but this book certainly did!! The flirty, sexually charged banter, the texting and Caroline&#8217;s hilarious internal dialogue had me rolling around in stitches from beginning to end.The story is about an interior designer named Caroline Reynolds who after an unfortunate experience with an ex has lost her O and she doesn&#8217;t seem to be making an appearance any time soon. To add insult to injury she is quickly discovering her new neighbour, that shares her bedroom wall, enjoys nocturnal activities of the loud variety and with a &#8220;harem&#8221; of different women.

I completely fell head over heels with those boys in Beautiful Disaster and I knew each of them would have their own story to tell and that it would be a wild ride to see who would capture these fun-loving, family oriented boys' hearts. We were briefly introduced to Trent and Cami in Travis's story, so we were already somewhat familiar with their characters.Pacing: I felt Beautiful Oblivion moved along at a good pace. I was engaged from the start and couldn't stop reading! We also have a slower building relationship between Trent and Cami and I really liked that we saw their friendship first. Their flirtatious banter was sweet, sexy, and fun and it really made you root for them that much more upon seeing how well they complemented one another.Storyline: I really enjoyed Trent and Cami's love story. It isn't cut and dry and it's actually quite complicated. Cami and Trent grew up in the same town, having attended the same schools, and are both aware of who the other is. Cami bartends at the Red Door bar, where Trent and his brother Travis frequent, but she is not on the market. Trying to make a long distance relationship work is difficult as it is, but to be constantly put on the backburner because their job is more important than you? Talk about a rough time. Cami knew going in that it would be hard and that their time together would be limited, but still she wants to make it work. How many disappointments can one endure before they just can't anymore? Trent saunters into Cami's life and refuses to be pushed away. This begins a rollercoaster ride of a friendship riddled with conflicting emotions and extreme sexual tension, as well as the threat of something greater that could ruin everything these two have built....It's also worth noting that the story takes place along the same timeline as Beautiful Disaster, so we do see several events coincide from that story only from Trent and Cami's point of view. It was interesting to see Travis go through his range of highs and lows with Abby and see it from an outsider's perspective.Characters: I enjoyed Trent's character a lot more than I did Travis's. Travis was a bit too much of a hothead for me. Trent was still a hothead, but he wasn't nearly as bad as Travis. Travis let a lot of his anger dictate his actions, where Trent was a bit more subdued. I liked that about Trent. He was calculated and didn't fly off the handle like his brother unless he felt it was necessary. (Which was usually in defense of Cami.) Trent isn't perfect though. He made some choices that have me shaking my head at him, but I shouldn't be surprised coming from a Maddox boy. What I love most about Trent his is dedication. He is extremely loyal to those he cares about and would do anything for them. We see this tenfold with his father and it just made him that much more endearing to me. He is persistent in his pursuit of Cami and it's amusing how undeterred by her boyfriend he is. However, when a Maddox boy falls, he falls hard and we really see that with both Trent and Travis in this book.I liked Cami, but she frustrated me a little bit. I didn't understand why she would stay with this boyfriend who can't make her a priority and make time for her. What is the point in even being in that relationship? I know, I know. She loves him. When you're in love, you don't always think rationally and when you remember how you felt when it was all shiny and new, you don't want to let go of that feeling. Trent coming into her life makes her question those feelings and she has to do some soul searching to find out what she really wants. She is pretty resistant to Trent and is determined to keep him at arm's length, even despite his boyish charms and persistence.She's spunky and fun and I really enjoyed seeing her give it back to Trent. She doesn't have the best family situation, and I really felt my heart go out to her because of how dysfunctional her family was.

I completely fell head over heels with those boys in Beautiful Disaster and I knew each of them would have their own story to tell and that it would be a wild ride to see who would capture these fun-loving, family oriented boys' hearts. We were briefly introduced to Trent and Cami in Travis's story, so we were already somewhat familiar with their characters.Pacing: I felt Beautiful Oblivion moved along at a good pace. I was engaged from the start and couldn't stop reading! We also have a slower building relationship between Trent and Cami and I really liked that we saw their friendship first. Their flirtatious banter was sweet, sexy, and fun and it really made you root for them that much more upon seeing how well they complemented one another.Storyline: I really enjoyed Trent and Cami's love story. It isn't cut and dry and it's actually quite complicated. Cami and Trent grew up in the same town, having attended the same schools, and are both aware of who the other is. Cami bartends at the Red Door bar, where Trent and his brother Travis frequent, but she is not on the market. Trying to make a long distance relationship work is difficult as it is, but to be constantly put on the backburner because their job is more important than you? Talk about a rough time. Cami knew going in that it would be hard and that their time together would be limited, but still she wants to make it work. How many disappointments can one endure before they just can't anymore? Trent saunters into Cami's life and refuses to be pushed away. This begins a rollercoaster ride of a friendship riddled with conflicting emotions and extreme sexual tension, as well as the threat of something greater that could ruin everything these two have built....It's also worth noting that the story takes place along the same timeline as Beautiful Disaster, so we do see several events coincide from that story only from Trent and Cami's point of view. It was interesting to see Travis go through his range of highs and lows with Abby and see it from an outsider's perspective.Characters: I enjoyed Trent's character a lot more than I did Travis's. Travis was a bit too much of a hothead for me. Trent was still a hothead, but he wasn't nearly as bad as Travis. Travis let a lot of his anger dictate his actions, where Trent was a bit more subdued. I liked that about Trent. He was calculated and didn't fly off the handle like his brother unless he felt it was necessary. (Which was usually in defense of Cami.) Trent isn't perfect though. He made some choices that have me shaking my head at him, but I shouldn't be surprised coming from a Maddox boy. What I love most about Trent his is dedication. He is extremely loyal to those he cares about and would do anything for them. We see this tenfold with his father and it just made him that much more endearing to me. He is persistent in his pursuit of Cami and it's amusing how undeterred by her boyfriend he is. However, when a Maddox boy falls, he falls hard and we really see that with both Trent and Travis in this book.I liked Cami, but she frustrated me a little bit. I didn't understand why she would stay with this boyfriend who can't make her a priority and make time for her. What is the point in even being in that relationship? I know, I know. She loves him. When you're in love, you don't always think rationally and when you remember how you felt when it was all shiny and new, you don't want to let go of that feeling. Trent coming into her life makes her question those feelings and she has to do some soul searching to find out what she really wants. She is pretty resistant to Trent and is determined to keep him at arm's length, even despite his boyish charms and persistence.She's spunky and fun and I really enjoyed seeing her give it back to Trent. She doesn't have the best family situation, and I really felt my heart go out to her because of how dysfunctional her family was. Being the oldest, she takes a lot of the blame and shoulders a lot more burden from her brothers than she should.In addition to seeing Travis, we get some great new side characters.

As the novel progresses, Josef reveals to Sage that he was a member of the SS who held a high position at Auschwitz- the largest death camp in all of Europe during WWII.

The rest of them, white ladies, just looks up to the ""Queen Bee"" of the most popular girl: ""Miss Leefolt sigh, hang up the phone like she just don't know how her brain gone operate without Miss Hilly coming over to push the Think buttons.""There are many factors for Miss Skeeter to turn out the way she is, and I live it up to you to discover. But the true purpose for writing the book became: ""For women to realize, we are just two people. Not much separates us. Not nearly as much as I thought."" For Jackson, Mississippi during the early 1960s, it is a revelation.I really want you, dear reader of my review, to get a taste of the language and the message of this thoughtful and enjoyable book. If you can, do purchase the Audible edition, the narration is so, so, so unbelievably REAL and wonderful!""I worked for Miss Margaret thirty-eight years. She had her a baby girl with the colic and the only thing that stopped the hurting was to hold her. So I made me a wrap. I tied her up on my waist, toted her around all day with me for a entire year. That baby like to break my back. Put ice packs on it ever night and still do. But I loved that girl. And I loved Miss Margaret.Miss Margaret always made me put my hair up in a rag, say she know coloreds don't wash their hair. Counted ever piece a silver after I done the polishing. When Miss Margaret die of the lady problems thirty years later, I go to the funeral. Her husband hug me, cry on my shoulder. When it's over, he give me a envelope. Inside a letter from Miss Margaret reading, 'Thank you. For making my baby stop hurting. I never forgot it.'Callie takes off her black-rimmed glasses, wipes her eyes.If any white lady reads my story, that's what I want them to know. Saying thank you, when you really mean it, when you remember what someone done for you-she shakes her head, stares down at the scratched table-it's so good.""There are moments that will make you laugh, moments that will make you angry and moments that will make your eyes shiny with tears. It is a book about Life and about our place in it and about choices we are to make every day: how to behave, what to accept and what to try to change.And once you have done all that you felt you should have, not much is left but to pick up the traces of your life and go on following your heart: ""You got nothing left here but enemies in the Junior League and a mama that's gonna drive you to drink. You done burned ever bridge there is. And you ain't never gone get another boyfriend in this town and everbody know it. So don't walk your white butt to New York, run it.""Run your butt to get the Audible copy of the book.

James Dashner's, The Maze Runner, has screamed at me from bookshelves for the past six months. At last, when I found an extra $9.99 in my pocket, I purchased it.The story follows a teenage boy named Thomas who wakes up in what seems to be a never-ending pitch-black elevator that deposits him into the center of a maze--a maze that's kept over 50 boys prisoner for several years. With a faulty memory and determination to find answers, Thomas seeks knowledge in every nook and cranny of the hundred-foot walls surrounding the only safe square to live in--the Glade.He has a rough entry into the created Glade culture, where boys take little pity on newcomers and everyone has accepted the fate of what seems to be an unsolvable maze. Every Glader has a duty--farming, cooking, healing, etc. Thomas wants to be a Runner--an explorer of the maze who spends all day seeking answers. Instead of welcoming him with open arms, the Gladers suspect him when things start to change. Boys remember him, but they don't know why. A girl shows up in the elevator-box (the first one ever). A message is received from the Creators. And Thomas somehow has bravery and answers no one else has seen before.When the ""end"" is triggered, the boys are forced to fight for their lives, their friends, and their sanity against the dreaded enemies called ""The Grievers"". Time is running out and escape options dwindle like a trickling waterfall.This book was a quick read--took me less than a week, which is saying a lot in my busy schedule. The plot was intriguing and many of the character emotions were deep and believable. I felt confused with Thomas and frustrated with his fleeting memories. The adventure is constant and page-turning, but a little on the darker side. Many children die over the course of the book and there are other things like sacrifices and torturing sickness.The end was rather dark and a little depressing. Not a lot of hope is left or achieved. The ""last battle"" of sorts is graphic, sad, and slightly disturbing with the knowledge that all the screams and deaths are those of teenage children. Throughout the novel, I found Thomas's lack of compassion in certain situations disturbing, like when a boy is sacrificed to the Maze.The plot had a lot of potential. It built and built and built to something I hoped would be great, but turned out to be predictable. It didn't feel unique, which then didn't seem to match the rest of the book. Once I discovered the answers behind the existence and purpose of the maze, I was sorely disappointed. It wasn't believable to me. It kept the imagination-cogs turning through the novel, but in the end weakened the story.The characters came off sadly bland and inconsistent. Thomas in particular seemed lacking in emotions and somehow managed to succeed at most of what he tried. While the reader wanted to see the characters eventually succeed, I felt a lack of inner conflict. Thomas just had a lot of outer conflict that was ""conquered"" with just a little average thinking.The ""culture"" created in the Maze lacked  hope and compassion and the only clear theme running throughout the novel was ""never give up."" But once we reached the end, no hope was reached. The book had so much potential--cool title, catching first chapter, and who doesn't like the idea of a giant creepy maze? Overall, I found the read interesting, but mediocre. It's doubtful I'd read it again. ANSWERNOTFOUND","Just the word ""maze"" incites an instant","(0, 39)",1,0.6666666666666666,True

Somehow Ms. Fisher makes reading about a vicious character work; and that is a first for me!  With that being said, I will now backpedal to the story line.Dirty Red is the second book in the Love Me with Lies series.  The first book The Opportunist is told in Olivia's perspective.  This book is told in Leah's perspective.  And I believe there is a third book told in Caleb's perspective (release date unknown).  Leah is a malicious, self-absorbed, narcissistic, delusional, spiteful, and cruel person.  I could find more derogatory words but I think I made my point.  This book starts around nine months after the last one ends.  Leah has just given birth to a healthy baby girl, who Caleb names Estella.  She hates being a mother instantaneously, and becomes jealous of the relationship between her daughter and Caleb. She makes bad decisions based on self interest that effect not only Estella, but her relationship with Caleb.  Caleb notices the lack of motherly love, and becomes angry and distant.  His anger makes it possible for there to be no sex scenes in this book for which I was eternally grateful.  I don't know if I could have handled that.  The past is told intermittently with the present similar to the first book.  It is here that some questions are answered, and some new ones posed.  We get introduced to Sam, Cammie's cousin in this book.  He is a likable character, and puts Leah in her place, often.  He will probably be in the next book.  And, of course we also get to know Leah better, ugh.  Her inner dialogue is worse than her actions, and that is hard to grasp. She is plain wicked!  I don't know if Ms. Fisher is trying to make you understand why she is the way she is by explaining her dysfunctional upbringing, or she is just telling her story.  Because many people have a dysfunctional upbringing and do not end up like her.  Therefore, I have little pity for her character.Unlike Olivia, I could not relate on any level to Leah.  I could see compassion in Olivia, where none was present in Leah.  She blamed everyone else for the problems in her life that she herself created. She plays on Caleb's compassion, and uses guilt to make him stay with her. Leah does not truly love Caleb, she is simply obsessed with him.  She could not possibly love him and treat him, and their daughter, so poorly.Whereas the first book made me feel enchanted, perplexed, and then heartbroken; this one left me feeling angry, bitter, and distressed, but hopeful.  Both are a roller coaster ride worth taking. Worth taking because the story line and writing style are wonderful, and Caleb is still so yummy!  I highly recommend reading this book directly after The Opportunist.  If you haven't read The Opportunist recently, I would re-read it before embarking upon this book.  I will definitely be re-reading both again in the near future.  In addition, I would read anything that this author writes.

While still not a favorite read of mine, I found it more entertaining than I remember and I actually came away engaged in the story and the characters.Reading it this time, I was more distinctly aware of the prohibition era in which these characters were revolving and the extent to which that directed some of their actions.  The drinking/partying took on a new aspect.  It also gave me a greater perception into Gatsby's character and his relation to society as a whole and the society he was trying to 'break into' (Daisy's).There was still plenty of superficiality to the characters...but that doesn't mean these characters are flat.  On the contrary, I saw a lot more depth this time around than in my early teens.  I was very impressed by the way Fitzgerald added so much depth to these characters while at the same time providing them with so little substance.I enjoyed looking more closely at the interactions between Gatsby and Daisy and the way the various relationships worked.  Now that I've actually dated and married, I viewed the relationships in a different light and could better understand the tension, jealousy and hypocritical behavior going on.I would like to have seen more development of the pseudo-relationship between Nick and Jordan, but I think leaving it vague throughout and then ending it abruptly allows for more in-depth thinking than if Nick and Jordan had happily escaped the tragedy surrounding them.I seem to remember there being significant discussion about the East/West geography in my Junior High English class...but reading it this time, I just didn't see that as a main motif.  Sure, we had ""West Egg"" and ""East Egg"" and various New York parties and excursions.  But when you get down to it, the East/West thing didn't work...partly because all of the main characters are just transplanted anyway (they all came from the west/midwest) and partly because the culture around them felt contrived anyway rather than some high culture that would be representative of the ""true culture"" of established Eastern money or whatever.I had forgotten some of the details of the climax and the ending and so was a little taken off guard when everything unraveled.  Parts of the climax scenes felt a little rushed or underdeveloped, but still provided a satisfying turn of events to the story arc, even if the end of the book left me a little unsettled (which is part of the intent, I believe).My initial rating from my Junior High memories was 2 out of 5 stars.  With a more mature perspective on reading and having read a whole lot more and learned a whole lot more, I can give a better rating and say that I can see now why this book is held up as a classic.

As it is, I'll skip the plot introduction and setup and go straight to my thoughts.Without a doubt, this book is a page-turner. Indeed, the same is true of the whole trilogy; I blew through all three books in a weekend. And it was a great ride. I liked Katniss well enough, and while I was reading I was certainly invested in the tale.In retrospect, though, this trilogy was compelling to me mostly because it's so fast-paced and action-driven. Not that that's the only thing it has going for it: Collins does a good job of developing the society, there are some intriguing plot elements and I liked the angle the book takes with the romance (in the first book, at least). And I liked that the book doesn't make out-of-place references to our current society or give infodumps on what happened between the modern day and its futuristic setting. But already, looking back on the trilogy I'm underwhelmed. So, a few of the problems:- The characterization is a bit iffy. I liked Katniss, but she didn't ever feel like a real teenager (except maybe in the third book). Peeta is sometimes sweet, but way too perfect. Gale seemed interesting, but we never saw much of him. The secondary characters aren't awful, but there just isn't much here that's memorable.- The premise seems specially created to give the characters serious moral dilemmas. Only, the book neatly avoids those dilemmas. The setup seems to require Katniss to kill basically nice people in order to survive.... the actual plot sidesteps that.- Speaking of the plot: a bit too gimmicky for my taste. I'd like less reliance on monsters and magical obstacle courses and such, and more conflict arising from the characters themselves. Your mileage may vary. The first book isn't too bad about this, but there's more and more of it as the trilogy continues.- And speaking of the setup. I simply never bought that forcing a couple dozen randomly-selected teenage (and younger) boys and girls to kill each other on national TV would be a good PR move for any government. Especially with all the efforts to humanize them--the pre-Games interviews, having viewers witness every moment of their struggles, strength and suffering, interviewing their families and friends, and so on. I bought that the Districts had to accept this because they were oppressed. I didn't buy the people in the Capitol thinking this was all good fun.- Finally, I could never figure out why, when there are so few people left in the world, they'd confine themselves to such small areas. District 12 only has 8000 people (the size of a small town) and seems to be the only settlement in all of Appalachia. So, why does everyone live within a fenced-in area as if this was a zombie book? Wild animals (the reason given in the book) didn't necessitate such a drastic response from either the Native Americans or the original European settlers, so I assumed it was a political ploy to keep the people under control.... but that didn't make a lot of sense either. With such abundant land and natural resources, why would the government want to keep the population small, starving and with little to lose when it could instead take credit for a growing population and improved standards of living as they made use of the surrounding area? And would controlling a wider area really be a problem for a government that already exercises such tight control over such vast distances? Presumably they're already capable of controlling it, or dissenters would just run off into the wilderness and create their own societies? This is simply never addressed.Anyway, this trilogy is entertaining enough, but if somebody asked me to recommend an exciting series about teenagers fighting a bad government, I'd recommend Marsden's Tomorrow series before I'd recommend this.

Between him making her breakfast, baking cookies and calling her sweetheart&#8230;I was all warm and fuzzy throughout this entire story!Where do I start with Avery?  She had a tough little exterior but not really and all she wanted was to overcome her past.  Who helps her do that??  You guessed it, Cam!  There is no insta-love which I very much appreciated and their friendship turned into much, much more but it happened gradually.  Cam asked her out every dang day and the way he would make her laugh would make anyone overcome their past!!

Now, before everyone starts throwing tomatoes at me, I will reiterate that I enjoyed this book!This is a very sweet story about overcoming your past and allowing yourself to fall in love.  What&#8217;s not to love about Cam?  He was perfection and there was nothing he could say that would make me do an eye-roll.  Between him making her breakfast, baking cookies and calling her sweetheart&#8230;I was all warm and fuzzy throughout this entire story!Where do I start with Avery?  She had a tough little exterior but not really and all she wanted was to overcome her past.  Who helps her do that??  You guessed it, Cam!  There is no insta-love which I very much appreciated and their friendship turned into much, much more but it happened gradually.  Cam asked her out every dang day and the way he would make her laugh would make anyone overcome their past!!  Clearly, all I&#8217;m doing is writing about Cam but he made a huge impact on me.This is a brief review about a book that will make you feel good and put a smile on your face.  It&#8217;s the kind of book that has the perfect amount of angst, great dialogue and amazing chemistry.  You will fall in love with Cam and that makes this book worth reading!

We tend to equate social power with social prowess. The outspoken people seen are as the leaders in our culture. Susan Cain, however, seeks to dispel this notion that people with a quiet nature cannot be major influencers or leaders. She opens her book Quiet by discussing one of the most influential figures in the civil rights movement. Rosa Parks made an impact in the civil rights movement through her quietness. She chose to take a quiet stand instead of being outspoken. In doing so, she became a symbol of strength in the movement. This is the first of many examples of introverts that Cain offers to show the power of quiet in a world that likes to talk.Quiet is Cain's attempt to prove that, despite America's preference to extroversion, introverts can be extremely successful and influential in our culture. She begins by discussing the ""Extroverted Ideal."" Since the time that Andrew Carnegie taught us how to win friends and influence people, the ideal personality has be extroverted. In the world of business and leadership, the way to get ahead is to speak up and stand out. Cain visits Harvard Business School to understand how they teach students to succeed in business. It becomes very clear that Harvard teaches their students to speak up or they won't succeed. The issue that Cain finds, however, is that in all their talking, people aren't listening. In this first part of the book, Cain poses the question of whether or not the extroverted ideal is really ideal. What she finds is people being trained to talk the most, whether they are educated or not, in order to get ahead.  Businesses promote group brainstorming which tends to favor the outspoken. Cain instead shows that often people who quietly, by themselves, and are allowed to think through the problems are more productive and effective that people working together in groups where people are fighting for attention. While the outspoken standout, they are not always bringing success and are often times talking over those who can give good ideas.The next part of here book looks at the biology and psychology behind introversion. Cain seeks to discover if introversion genetic. This section is much different that the first part of the book, but still interesting. I found this section of the book personally interesting because I read through it going, ""Oh, That's why I am like that."" Introversion and extroversion seems to be built into our brain functions even from birth. It effects the way we think and process information.The third part of Cain's book compares our culture with Asian cultures to see if the Extroverted ideal is apparent in all cultures. Cain shows that there are major differences between the two cultures. America sees extroversion as ideal, while Asian cultures see introversion as ideal. One of the primary differences is how success is achieved. Introverted cultures tend to succeed through persistence and perseverance, while extroverted cultures succeed but speaking over others and getting your ideas heard. Cain uses this to show the some of the people we see as successful succeeded because of persistence instead of outspokenness.Last, Cain discusses living as an introvert and with introverts. She applies what she's discussed in previous sections to having relationships, working in an extroverted culture, and raising introverted children. This section is a good balance to the rest of the book which is trying to show that extroversion is not the ideal. Cain reminds her readers that sometimes introverts do need to speak up, but should also not lose the good qualities that introversion brings. She also offers very good practical information on how to live in introvert-extrovert relationships and how to raise introvert children.Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World that Can't Stop Talking is a great book. Susan Cain does a good job of presenting how our culture favors extroversion and looks down on introverts. It may seem at first that Cain is trying to say that introverts are better than extroverts, but reading through the whole work she does a wonderful job of challenging introverts to grow in certain areas. She also challenges extroverts to consider the benefits that introverts are able bring. As an introvert myself I most appreciated the second and fourth sections of the book. I was very interested to learn about myself and why I am the way I am. The second section does a good job of explaining many the biological factors of introversion and extroversion. The fourth section is very helpful because of the helpful advice for living with extroverts and raising and teaching introverted children.I would recommend this book to just about anyone. If you are an introverted, you will find this book very helpful and encouraging. If you are an extrovert, you can learn why your introverted friends are the way they are and how to best interact with them. I would highly recommend this book to anyone in a business situation, this book can be really helpful in learning how to get the most out of the introverts in your office. I would also recommend it to my friends in the ministry along with Adam S. McHugh's bookIntroverts in the Church: Finding Our Place in an Extroverted Culture. I hope that Cain's book will help people change their understanding of introversion. Introversion is not a weakness. There may be areas where introverts are weak, but there are always areas where introverts tend to be stronger than extroverts.I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review.

Brooke Dumas is finally back in the arms of Remington &#34;The Riptide&#34; Tate and starts his first fight of the season. Remy has been training with a vengeance, preparing to face his re-match against Scorpion after throwing the championship last season. While Remy tries to fights his way to the championship, Brooke's insecurities and jealousy plays a major factor in their hot steamy relationship.Remy is still the strong Alpha male fighter we saw in Real but in Mine, readers get to see a more vulnerable, stronger, deeper side to him. In Real, Remy was a man of few words and communicated and expressed his feelings through the songs on his Ipod but in this book he begins to communicate and show his love for Brooke. He still lets his tunes express his thoughts and emotions. When this man opens up his heart, he fully lets you in. His love for his friends and Brooke is so deep and strong that he will fight and protect what he cherishes most at whatever cost. This is a man who has been hurt and abandoned by his parents and yet he keeps fighting and surviving. As strong as Remy is, the only person who can shake his world to the core, is no other than Brooke.Brooke undeniably loves Remy so much. He belongs to her. She belongs to him. But somewhere along the way, Brooke's insecurities and jealousy creeps in. She was constantly in need of reaffirmation from him to profess his love for her. Although it was getting to the point of annoying, I do admire the fact that she truly saw the real Remy . She saw a man who was physically strong and beautiful on the outside as well as inside. She loves the &#34;blue&#34; or &#34;black&#34; Remy. She loves the man who is her lion, her protector, the man who stole her heart. Brooke really lives and breathes for Remy, her entire identity is swallowed up by what she can be for him. The relationship of Remy and Brooke is still as hot and steamy as ever. These two have so much passion and sexual chemistry that most of their deepest and heartfelt connections were often in bed.My Thoughts:Did I like MINE? Yes, but I did not love it. I would have given this book a 4.5~5 star rating but Brooke's insecurities and jealousy throughout the book was the downfall. Her constant need for Remy to reassure her that she's the only one in his life was getting annoying. How many times does Remy need to tell that she's his? She belongs to him and vice versa. Remy, on the other hand was amazing. He was able to balance his work life and his relationship with Brooke. I adored the way he worshiped, loved, and reassured her.

Brooke Dumas is finally back in the arms of Remington &#34;The Riptide&#34; Tate and starts his first fight of the season. Remy has been training with a vengeance, preparing to face his re-match against Scorpion after throwing the championship last season. While Remy tries to fights his way to the championship, Brooke's insecurities and jealousy plays a major factor in their hot steamy relationship.Remy is still the strong Alpha male fighter we saw in Real but in Mine, readers get to see a more vulnerable, stronger, deeper side to him. In Real, Remy was a man of few words and communicated and expressed his feelings through the songs on his Ipod but in this book he begins to communicate and show his love for Brooke. He still lets his tunes express his thoughts and emotions. When this man opens up his heart, he fully lets you in. His love for his friends and Brooke is so deep and strong that he will fight and protect what he cherishes most at whatever cost. This is a man who has been hurt and abandoned by his parents and yet he keeps fighting and surviving. As strong as Remy is, the only person who can shake his world to the core, is no other than Brooke.Brooke undeniably loves Remy so much. He belongs to her. She belongs to him. But somewhere along the way, Brooke's insecurities and jealousy creeps in. She was constantly in need of reaffirmation from him to profess his love for her. Although it was getting to the point of annoying, I do admire the fact that she truly saw the real Remy . She saw a man who was physically strong and beautiful on the outside as well as inside. She loves the &#34;blue&#34; or &#34;black&#34; Remy. She loves the man who is her lion, her protector, the man who stole her heart. Brooke really lives and breathes for Remy, her entire identity is swallowed up by what she can be for him. The relationship of Remy and Brooke is still as hot and steamy as ever. These two have so much passion and sexual chemistry that most of their deepest and heartfelt connections were often in bed.My Thoughts:Did I like MINE? Yes, but I did not love it. I would have given this book a 4.5~5 star rating but Brooke's insecurities and jealousy throughout the book was the downfall. Her constant need for Remy to reassure her that she's the only one in his life was getting annoying. How many times does Remy need to tell that she's his? She belongs to him and vice versa. Remy, on the other hand was amazing. He was able to balance his work life and his relationship with Brooke. I adored the way he worshiped, loved, and reassured her. Lastly, I Ioved Brooke's love letter at the end of the book. It was a PERFECT way to end the book. Overall, fans of Remington &#34;THE RIPTIDE&#34; Tate and Brooke Dumas will be happy with continuation of their love story. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3003, 3017)",1,0.0,False

The highly esteemed curator of the museum, Jacques Sauniere, has been found shot to death in the most bizarre crime-scene imaginable. He is found spread-eagled, naked and with messages scrawled around and on him (in both blood and florescent ink), all of which is his own doing, and which Langdon believes is a series of cryptic clues that point to the killer.However, unbeknownst to Langdon he is the police's main suspect, though it is not until he is joined by French cryptologist Sophie Neveu (beautiful, confident and green-eyed, of course), that he realises the trouble he's in. From this meeting stems the discovery of several ingenious clues concealed by the dead man that take the two of them on a whirl-wind treasure hunt in search of - what else? - the Holy Grail.

It may take a stretch of credibility that a respectable (and innocent!) professor would take a complete stranger's advice in fleeing a crime-scene and remain on the run, but once the ball gets rolling it's one heck of a roller coaster ride.But the leaps of logic aren't the only thing that has caused criticism. During the course of Langdon and Neveu's adventure, the core-conspiracy that lies at the heart of the story (that is, the humanity and blood-line of Jesus Christ) is explored by establishing certain ""facts"" shared between characters in discussions that are meant to strengthen - even prove - the existence of a church cover-up. The problem is that these facts are seldom correct. One could take the `hey, it's just fiction', stance and that's fair enough, but Brown seems to expect the reader to take his information as truth and even provides a disclaimer at the beginning of the novel that declares a series of ""Facts"", including ""all descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents and secret rituals in this novel are accurate."" This statement, to put it simply, is not true.I'm no historian, but even I could spot gaps in his research, including an incorrect date on the finding of the Dead Sea Scrolls. And when information is lacking, Brown simply fills in the gaps as it suits him; as when he quotes the Gospel of Philip: ""Christ loved her (Mary Magdalene) more than all the disciples and used to kiss her often on the mouth."" Don't quote me on this, but I believe in actuality, the original document is damaged and the word ""mouth"" indecipherable as a result. The word *could* be mouth...but it could also be feet, forehead, hand, cheek or any other part of the body.These are only two examples off the top of my head; rest assured there are many more and a simple internet-search will access many websites that highlight other moments of fabrication or subversion in Brown's research. Of course, most readers will understand this for themselves as they read through the book; yet the problem lies with readers who are happy to take Brown's word for it all. Rest assured, ""The Da Vinci Code's"" historical context needs to be read with a grain of salt.And yet this is not the end of the controversy. There are claims that the book takes a negative view of the Catholic Church, demonising its teachings and its people. Although I can see the point of this claim, I also believe there may be some overreaction at work. On the whole Brown steers clear of anti-religious hysteria. Although that may sound like an odd thing to say considering the most blatant villain is a religious fanatic, Brown is careful to accommodate the existence of faithful, decent and worthy religious individuals and organisations. Personally, I found it more offensive that the afore-mentioned villain is portrayed as an albino, with the suggestion that this condition is the cause of his near-insane persona. And the fact that he is described as having red eyes is truly irritating; albinos do NOT have red eyes - that is a complete myth; they usually have grey or green eyes.The length of time I spent in this review on discussing the controversy surrounding the book rather than the book itself may be an indicator of where its popularity truly lies! I for one, found ""The Da Vinci Code"" to be a good, exciting, interesting read and I enjoyed it.

Though the conspiracy theory it deals with is a legitimate one (and by that I mean it is not simply invented by the author, but was a theory, however flimsy, in existence before publication), many of its historical facts and figures are hopelessly incorrect and/or misleading. Though the two lead protagonists are pleasant enough people, they are can hardly be considered three-dimensional characters (though again, they technically don't really need to be) and the action-sequences are suspenseful and nerve-wracking. And despite some who will undoubtedly take Brown's claims for granted, surely it can only be considered a good thing if some readers who would otherwise not do so find themselves looking more into history as a result of reading his book.

Bear with me please. I don't normally feel the need to state this, but with all of the controversy surrounding this book, I want to make sure you know this review is spoiler free.I&#8217;m sure you all have seen tons of press about Allegiant. This was probably the most anticipated book of the year for most people. It definitely was for me. So I&#8217;m sure you saw the Allegiant countdown widgets on everyone&#8217;s blogs. I&#8217;m sure you saw dozens of Waiting on Wednesday posts about this. There was a mishap with some supplier somewhere and some people got copies super early, which means spoilers were leaked. And then release date finally came. Now normally, I go to my local book store and pick up books that I&#8217;m highly anticipating so that I can have them on release day, but the last one I bought was almost half price on Amazon compared to my local book store on release day. (Yeah, yeah, Amazon&#8217;s the devil. Well not to me. I heart Amazon.) And so this time I preordered Allegiant through Amazon instead of picking it up on release day. This meant that tons of people got their hands on Allegiant a couple of days before me. Enough time for spoilers to begin amassing, comments to begin piling up, and opinions began to be formed.And well, I say all of that to say that I was extremely nervous going in to Allegiant. I&#8217;m not normally one of those people who dreads reading the last book in a series just in case it doesn&#8217;t go the way I want it to. I&#8217;m more of the type that dives in head first because I can&#8217;t wait to experience it whether good or bad. But all of the hype and comments had me stressed to the max about this book. Let me be clear, I didn&#8217;t read any spoilers, but I did read some where others had read spoilers and based off the spoilers decided not to even pick up the book. All of this buzz and conflict had me a bundle of nerves. (Didn&#8217;t help that I was already having some anxiety over some real life things as well.)Ultimately I picked up and finished Allegiant. The beginning was going just fine. I wondered to myself &#8220;what are all of these people complaining about?&#8221; And then I hit the middle and I started getting frustrated with these characters *clears throat and cuts eyes* (**FOUR!!!!!). I really wanted to pop them him over the head. And I don&#8217;t know if it was the negative hype, my personal frustrations with characters making some really dumb decisions especially when those characters are supposed to be smart, or if it was my general anxiety, but during this part of the book, I really just wanted to throw the thing across the room. The ending wasn't the part that frustrated me the most. It was the middle. But nevertheless, I moved passed the frustrating middle business and things got better for me. And then the ending happened. I probably would have been frustrated with it had I not been warned that many people hated it, and therefore I lowered my expectations. But the ending really just wasn&#8217;t that big of a deal for me as far as getting angry or upset. It made me sad. I teared up, but I found the ending to be solid and acceptable.Four and Tris start off Allegiant in a rocky kind of place. She lied to him about several things in Insurgent, and so he&#8217;s got some trust issues based off that. But they have a talk about how they both need to do a better job being honest with each other, and so things get better. They find themselves on more stable ground.My favorite relationship oriented quotes:&#8220;We&#8217;re not people who touch each other carelessly; every point of contact between us feels important, a rush of energy and relief.&#8221; - Four&#8220;I Feel the urge, familiar now, to wrench myself from my body and speak directly into her mind. It is the same urge, I realize, that makes me want to kiss her every time I see her, because even a sliver of distance between us is infuriating.&#8221; - FourI was as I mentioned above extremely frustrated with Four at one point. He made a decision that was contradictory to a conversation that he and Tris had. Then he semi-rectifies it and talks about it with her. But he doesn&#8217;t listen to her. Turns out she was right. I know that&#8217;s a sticky place to be&#8212;situated between your own judgment and the judgment of someone else that you highly respect and trust. Truthfully I felt like the Four from Allegiant, and even Insurgent really, wasn&#8217;t the same person from Divergent. He felt like a completely different person. His mannerism. His speech. His attitude. His decisions. They all felt like they were coming from two different people. Maybe that was supposed to be the difference between him being Four and him being Tobias (I hate that name by the way). But I would think that Tobias would be a more complete person and Four would be just one side of himself&#8212;just the Dauntless side. But that wasn&#8217;t the case at all. Maybe the Tobias part is the part that carries the baggage from his past which weighs him down and causes him to question and doubt. Whatever the cause, and not just because of the name, but Four is a much more likable and understandable character than Tobias for me.One of my favorite aspects of Allegiant, and something that I don&#8217;t point out in books that I read enough, was the quotable moments that seem more like life lessons. Here are a couple of examples:&#8220;I need to deny them the power to control me. I need to know that I am stronger than they are.&#8221; &#8211; Four, discussing his fears.&#8220;And as I stare out at the land, I think that this, if nothing else, is compelling evidence for my parents&#8217; God, that our world is so massive that it is completely out of our control, that we cannot possibly be as large as we feel.&#8221; &#8211; Tris, which makes me think of Romans 1:20 (NKJV) &#8211; &#8220;For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse.&#8221;&#8220;I feel like what I have become is halfway between my mother and my father, violent and impulsive and desperately afraid. I feel like I have lost control of what I have become.&#8221; - Four&#8220;So how can I hold Tobias&#8217;s desperation against him, like I&#8217;m better than him, like I&#8217;ve never let my own brokenness blind me?&#8221; &#8211; Tris, forgiveness&#8212;something this world could use a little more of.&#8220;I used to think that when people fell in love, they just landed where they landed, and they had no choice in the matter afterward.

I LOVED the games. And I LOVED the Dauntless initiation process. But I hated the political part of both of these series. I disliked the whole war idea and taking down the corrupt government. While I do really love the idea of how much one person can make a difference, this side of the series&#8212;the war and politics&#8212;wasn&#8217;t what I fell in love with. I wanted more initiation. I wanted more Dauntless. While I love Tris and Four, I think I would have been happier with the series if we&#8217;d followed other characters through their initiation process rather than follow Tris and Four through the rise and fall of multiple corrupt governments. Whereas with The Hunger Games series, I loved both The Hunger Games and Catching Fire because both of these had a the games in them, I didn&#8217;t really like Mockingjay as much because it focused on the politics. Unfortunately for the Divergent series, Divergent itself was the only book in the series that focused on the initiation process. And therefore, both Insurgent and Allegiant felt lacking to me. I don&#8217;t typically read reviews before I write my own, but I broke my own rule in this case and I can&#8217;t think of a better way to describe this than she did. Jen from YA Romantics said in her review of Allegiant on Goodreads that Divergent felt more Dauntless and Allegiant felt more Abnegation.

I strongly wish I could discuss this is greater detail with you guys, but I can&#8217;t spoil it for anyone who hasn&#8217;t read it. I&#8217;m surprised I haven&#8217;t spoiled anything in this review as it is.Anyway, I think Allegiant gets 4 Stars. It&#8217;s still a well written book. It still sparked emotion within me&#8212;even if mostly anxiety. Have you read Allegiant? If so, what did you think?

Bear with me please. I don't normally feel the need to state this, but with all of the controversy surrounding this book, I want to make sure you know this review is spoiler free.I&#8217;m sure you all have seen tons of press about Allegiant. This was probably the most anticipated book of the year for most people. It definitely was for me. So I&#8217;m sure you saw the Allegiant countdown widgets on everyone&#8217;s blogs. I&#8217;m sure you saw dozens of Waiting on Wednesday posts about this. There was a mishap with some supplier somewhere and some people got copies super early, which means spoilers were leaked. And then release date finally came. Now normally, I go to my local book store and pick up books that I&#8217;m highly anticipating so that I can have them on release day, but the last one I bought was almost half price on Amazon compared to my local book store on release day. (Yeah, yeah, Amazon&#8217;s the devil. Well not to me. I heart Amazon.) And so this time I preordered Allegiant through Amazon instead of picking it up on release day. This meant that tons of people got their hands on Allegiant a couple of days before me. Enough time for spoilers to begin amassing, comments to begin piling up, and opinions began to be formed.And well, I say all of that to say that I was extremely nervous going in to Allegiant. I&#8217;m not normally one of those people who dreads reading the last book in a series just in case it doesn&#8217;t go the way I want it to. I&#8217;m more of the type that dives in head first because I can&#8217;t wait to experience it whether good or bad. But all of the hype and comments had me stressed to the max about this book. Let me be clear, I didn&#8217;t read any spoilers, but I did read some where others had read spoilers and based off the spoilers decided not to even pick up the book. All of this buzz and conflict had me a bundle of nerves. (Didn&#8217;t help that I was already having some anxiety over some real life things as well.)Ultimately I picked up and finished Allegiant. The beginning was going just fine. I wondered to myself &#8220;what are all of these people complaining about?&#8221; And then I hit the middle and I started getting frustrated with these characters *clears throat and cuts eyes* (**FOUR!!!!!). I really wanted to pop them him over the head. And I don&#8217;t know if it was the negative hype, my personal frustrations with characters making some really dumb decisions especially when those characters are supposed to be smart, or if it was my general anxiety, but during this part of the book, I really just wanted to throw the thing across the room. The ending wasn't the part that frustrated me the most. It was the middle. But nevertheless, I moved passed the frustrating middle business and things got better for me. And then the ending happened. I probably would have been frustrated with it had I not been warned that many people hated it, and therefore I lowered my expectations. But the ending really just wasn&#8217;t that big of a deal for me as far as getting angry or upset. It made me sad. I teared up, but I found the ending to be solid and acceptable.Four and Tris start off Allegiant in a rocky kind of place. She lied to him about several things in Insurgent, and so he&#8217;s got some trust issues based off that. But they have a talk about how they both need to do a better job being honest with each other, and so things get better. They find themselves on more stable ground.My favorite relationship oriented quotes:&#8220;We&#8217;re not people who touch each other carelessly; every point of contact between us feels important, a rush of energy and relief.&#8221; - Four&#8220;I Feel the urge, familiar now, to wrench myself from my body and speak directly into her mind. It is the same urge, I realize, that makes me want to kiss her every time I see her, because even a sliver of distance between us is infuriating.&#8221; - FourI was as I mentioned above extremely frustrated with Four at one point. He made a decision that was contradictory to a conversation that he and Tris had. Then he semi-rectifies it and talks about it with her. But he doesn&#8217;t listen to her. Turns out she was right. I know that&#8217;s a sticky place to be&#8212;situated between your own judgment and the judgment of someone else that you highly respect and trust. Truthfully I felt like the Four from Allegiant, and even Insurgent really, wasn&#8217;t the same person from Divergent. He felt like a completely different person. His mannerism. His speech. His attitude. His decisions. They all felt like they were coming from two different people. Maybe that was supposed to be the difference between him being Four and him being Tobias (I hate that name by the way). But I would think that Tobias would be a more complete person and Four would be just one side of himself&#8212;just the Dauntless side. But that wasn&#8217;t the case at all. Maybe the Tobias part is the part that carries the baggage from his past which weighs him down and causes him to question and doubt. Whatever the cause, and not just because of the name, but Four is a much more likable and understandable character than Tobias for me.One of my favorite aspects of Allegiant, and something that I don&#8217;t point out in books that I read enough, was the quotable moments that seem more like life lessons. Here are a couple of examples:&#8220;I need to deny them the power to control me. I need to know that I am stronger than they are.&#8221; &#8211; Four, discussing his fears.&#8220;And as I stare out at the land, I think that this, if nothing else, is compelling evidence for my parents&#8217; God, that our world is so massive that it is completely out of our control, that we cannot possibly be as large as we feel.&#8221; &#8211; Tris, which makes me think of Romans 1:20 (NKJV) &#8211; &#8220;For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse.&#8221;&#8220;I feel like what I have become is halfway between my mother and my father, violent and impulsive and desperately afraid. I feel like I have lost control of what I have become.&#8221; - Four&#8220;So how can I hold Tobias&#8217;s desperation against him, like I&#8217;m better than him, like I&#8217;ve never let my own brokenness blind me?&#8221; &#8211; Tris, forgiveness&#8212;something this world could use a little more of.&#8220;I used to think that when people fell in love, they just landed where they landed, and they had no choice in the matter afterward. And maybe that&#8217;s true of beginnings, but it&#8217;s not true of this, now. I fell in love with him. But I don&#8217;t just stay with him by default as if there&#8217;s no one else available to me. I stay with him because I choose to, every day that I wake up, every day that we fight or lie to each other or disappoint each other. I choose him over and over again, and he chooses me.&#8221; &#8211; Tris, love isn&#8217;t just about how someone makes me feel, it&#8217;s more, it&#8217;s deeper, it&#8217;s harder than just that.

I was intrigued by Solomon's resiliency, attitude and his dignity throughout his twelve year ordeal. We are so fortunate that he was willing to share his story. We are also fortunate that Steve McQueen and his wonderful cast made this book into a movie which tells the story. Whether or not you saw the movie and liked it or not, you should read the book. Even though it is a difficult topic and tragic situation Solomon and Bass prove humanity and resilience prevail when people choose the higher ground.

The characters are completely unbelievable in their roles. The profiler (Kyle) is a felon and psychiatric patient but is trusted with sensitive information and allowed to lead a police investigation. The lead detective (Nicole) is totally inept as a police officer and has more than a few loose screws. She seems not to understand investigative or police procedure. Along with the other law officers they display all the ineptitude of the Keystone Cops but none of the humor. Both Kyle and Nicole are emotionally immature and mentally unstable (although the author attempts to portray them as 'misunderstood'). Their relationship is not at all believable. The plot begins reasonably enough -- a serial killer preys on women and takes a trophy -- but turns bizarre and then ridiculous. I suppose that is the word I would use to sum this book: 'ridiculous'.The author has enormous flights of fancy unconstrained by matters of law, psychology, or medicine. The novel belies the lack of fact checking. For example, scenes in the book break many rules of police procedure with regard to crime scene investigation, chain of evidence, and apprehension and questioning of suspects. One example of another type of error is when a police officer shows a picture of a woman who has a ""split lip"" after being beat up. The police officer states that it took 27 stitches to close the lip. That's quite a ""split lip"". Sutures average about 5 stitches to the inch; slightly more for the face. An incision requiring 27 stitches would be about 5 inches long, and that is longer than a lip. It's about the circumference of the mouth. Another medical misstep occurs when the author states that Kyle had his blood drawn every hour to be tested for mad cow disease. First, there is no blood test for mad cow disease. Second, one would not check blood every hour for any infectious disease -- it simply isn't useful. Apparently the author thought that 27 stitches or testing blood every hour sounded extreme and so used them. However, these (and many other things in the book) are beyond extreme: they're ridiculous. A bit of research would have prevented such bizarre errors.As another reviewer stated, there's a reason this book is self-published: no reputable publisher would have printed it.

The characters are completely unbelievable in their roles. The profiler (Kyle) is a felon and psychiatric patient but is trusted with sensitive information and allowed to lead a police investigation. The lead detective (Nicole) is totally inept as a police officer and has more than a few loose screws. She seems not to understand investigative or police procedure. Along with the other law officers they display all the ineptitude of the Keystone Cops but none of the humor. Both Kyle and Nicole are emotionally immature and mentally unstable (although the author attempts to portray them as 'misunderstood'). Their relationship is not at all believable. The plot begins reasonably enough -- a serial killer preys on women and takes a trophy -- but turns bizarre and then ridiculous. I suppose that is the word I would use to sum this book: 'ridiculous'.The author has enormous flights of fancy unconstrained by matters of law, psychology, or medicine. The novel belies the lack of fact checking.

The main ideas in this story have been done before for sure, but that doesn't mean that this book wasn't enjoyable.  It was.  I thought that McGarry did a very good job and her writing was great as well.The story is told in alternating POVs between Echo and Noah.  I actually preferred Noah's narrations better for some reason.  This is weird for me, because I typically prefer reading from a female's perspective rather than a male's (since I am a female).  Noah is an endearing young man.  He has home-life issues that have ultimately turned him into a girl-using, non-caring, stoner -- at least, on the outside.  Throughout the book, we discover the real Noah and how caring he actually is, especially when it comes to his love for his brothers.  Echo is similar in some ways.  There was an incident in her past that caused her to lose her popularity at school and to become more of a loner herself.  But, she still manages to keep up her grades and be an all-around good girl.  Therefore, in many ways, these two are meant for each other, as they both are understanding about having not-so-perfect home lives.I would recommend this book to all you romance lovers out there, as there is plenty of lovey-dovey content. It is also more than just a simple love story, though, as you will see once you pick the book up and begin to delve into the lives of Noah and Echo.  I enjoyed it and think that you would too!

I really enjoyed this book, I am a huge fan of the vampire themed stories, and this was really just a great read. Kagawa sucks you in from page one with an eerie, disturbing setting for this story, and I liked that we get to know Allie as a human before all of the action starts. Her life pretty much just sucks, and when her decision to lead her friends out in unsafe lands for food leaves her alone and dying, her saving grace is a vamp that can turn her. If she chooses it. So, she becomes what she hates in order to survive, and her world will never be the same. Kanin, her sire, trains her in the life of a vampire, then she sets off on her own into the outer lands, where the rabids roam free and kill anything in their path. There she meets up with a group of humans that are traveling to find Eden, a rumored city where they will be safe from the rabids. Allie has to hide what she is from these humans if she wants to survive, but with nosy Ruth hating her and a mutual attraction for the steamy Zeke, it may not be easy.This story was full of action and twists, it was virtually non-stop thrills or drama once Allie is in the outlands. I loved that Allie was totally bad-ass, even though she tended to be a little selfish before she met up with the humans. I was upset with how she put Kanin in grave danger and then just left, but I'm hopeful that she can redeem herself later!! She grows so much throughout the story, putting the needs of others before hers and really owning what she has become. There were so many upsetting moments in the story, characters I grew to care about losing their lives or suffering. But the journey they take was exciting and an absolute blast to read, and I actually like the way things wrapped up. Nothing's set in stone, yet we don't get that 'happily ever after' feel since there's so much more of the story to come. Will be looking forward to the next book in this series!!

I was upset with how she put Kanin in grave danger and then just left, but I'm hopeful that she can redeem herself later!! She grows so much throughout the story, putting the needs of others before hers and really owning what she has become. There were so many upsetting moments in the story, characters I grew to care about losing their lives or suffering. But the journey they take was exciting and an absolute blast to read, and I actually like the way things wrapped up. Nothing's set in stone, yet we don't get that 'happily ever after' feel since there's so much more of the story to come. Will be looking forward to the next book in this series!!

After two weeks of wallowing she knows it is time to start rebuilding her life again, she needs to start having fun and making new friends and she needs to catch up on her classes before she is kicked out of college. After a party one night she is attacked by someone she thought she could trust, saved by a stranger she just wants to forget about everything that happened but when her attacker starts making threats she realises that she has to stand up for herself. As she grows closer to the boy who saved her she begins to re-build her confidence but what kind of future can they have if she discovers the secrets he is keeping from her?I'd heard a lot of great things about Tammara Webber's debut novel Easy so when I was offered a review copy I jumped at the chance of reading it. I have been loving the recent influx of new adult books and Easy is up there with the best that I have read. The author doesn't shy away from tackling sensitive topics such as attempted rape but she does it with sensitivity. The scenes where Jacqueline was attacked made for difficult reading, you felt her fear, shock and horror right along with her and I think most women will be able to identify how weak she felt because she was unable to fight her attacker off on her own. As horrific as the incident was Jacqueline was lucky that Lucas came along at the right time to save her. Unfortunately a lot of other women don't have a rescuer so one of the things I appreciated most was the way the author included tips on how to avoid getting into that situation. Yes, a lot of the things mentioned are pretty obvious when you think about it but I'd be willing to bet that most of us have put ourselves into a dangerous situation at some point in our lives (I know I did as a teen and probably even have as an adult), even if we were lucky enough not to have anything happen to us. Using common sense doesn't guarantee your safety but it does make it less likely you'll find yourself in Jacqueline's situation. I think it's important to raise the issue that rape isn't just something that happens amongst strangers, it could be the boy next door, your best friend's boyfriend or even the boy you are dating. Of course not all men are potential rapists but that doesn't mean women and girls don't need to be careful and aware of their surroundings. I also think that self defence classes are something that should be compulsory for teenagers - I wish I'd taken a class like the one Jacqueline joined. In fact, if I could find one locally I'd join it now!As much as Jacqueline's attack was an important part of the story I don't want to make it sound like this was a depressing read because it really wasn't. It was about Jacqueline's journey to find herself, she had built her dreams around those of her boyfriend and when he dumped her she had to remember what she really wanted from her life. Jacqueline had her moments of depression but overall she was a strong woman and she refused to let her attacker intimidate her even after he started a campaign against her. The attacker was one of the most vile characters I've come across in a long time so I was pleased to see him get what he deserved. Another thing I loved was the fact that Jacqueline's best friend Erin was so supportive, she never once questioned that Jacqueline was telling the truth about her attack and she stood up for her friend even though it cost her. An important message to take from the book is that if you are attacked it isn't your fault, there is no such thing as ""asking for it"" and there is NEVER an excuse for anyone (male or female) to attack someone else. One of my favourite lines in the book was ""I could blame the alcohol . . . but no. Alcohol removed inhibitions. It doesn't trigger criminal violence where there was none before."" I think that was one of the most sensible things that Jacqueline said!I can't write this review without telling you how much I loved Lucas, he was incredibly sweet and protective but at the same time he didn't want to smother Jacqueline - he wanted to empower her so that she was able to protect herself and I think that was what I appreciated most about him. Yes, he would do anything to save her pain but he wanted to make sure she was safe even when he wasn't around. The back story with Lucas just about broke my heart, he had been through so much and deserved to find happiness as much as Jacqueline did. I had guessed part of his secret fairly early on but that didn't spoil my enjoyment of the story in the slightest even though I was practically begging him to open up and tell her the truth.In case you haven't already gathered Easy is a book that I would highly recommend to any fan of the new adult genre. Tammara Webber has a great writing style that will suck you in from the beginning and this isn't your standard romance. These characters are three dimensional and so real to me I felt like I was losing friends when I finished the book.

The cover and the title made it seem a bit cheesy and the synopsis didn't really grab my attention.  I'm not a huge fan of contemporary romance anyway so initially I decided to pass this one up.  Then I saw some super early reactions from bloggers whose opinions I generally tend to agree with and I decided to go ahead and give it a shot.  For being a book I wasn't even interested in trying at first I was really blown away.  The story was not cheesy in the least, the characters were dynamic and interesting and the drama sucked me right in.  I fell in love with Echo and Noah and found myself devouring this story.  Best of all, the book had real depth and the romance was not the least bit one dimensional.  I loved this book!LIKES:Story is told from both Noah's and Echo's perspectives:  I really love it when stories are told from multiple perspectives.

What if its father is dead beside it in the boat in which they sailed?  Can you safely presume both parents have perished, or is the mother alive and well, searching desperately for her child?This is the very predicament that husband and wife Tom and Isabel Sherbourne face in M.L. Stedman's debut novel ""The Light Between Oceans"".  Set in the fictional locales of Janus Rock and Point Partageuse, Australia, the story begins in 1918 and ends somewhere beyond the conclusion of WWII, nearly each character within its pages irrevocably changed.The book has a less-than-stellar beginning, the first 20-odd pages following its prologue a bit of a bore.  Stedman offers the reader unnecessary detail; how Tom acquired his lighthouse keeping job could've been narrowed down to just a few pages.  The story of how Tom and Isabel meet isn't all that interesting either, making it hard to understand why Isabel romantically pursues him.  The dawdling pace in this section makes it seem as if this portion of the book was written by someone else.Once a reader moves past this part, however, the story develops an unrelenting intensity, the moral dilemma at the heart of it never failing to wrench the heartstrings.  On one end, you have a childless couple who have endured two miscarriages and a stillbirth.  On the other, you have a woman who lost the love of her life and her infant daughter, their fates assumed rather than known.  The reader will undoubtedly sympathize with and root for both sides at different points, Stedman spinning the moral compass of her characters in such a way that no one is sure in the end where the arrow of rationale may point.Though bound to one another through love and shared adversity, the foundling drives a wedge between Tom and Isabel, sowing seeds of acrimony and anguish once certain events come to pass.  Tom is of impeccable moral standing but his love for his wife and the misfortune that has befallen them both has him making decisions contrary to his beliefs.  His mild and reticent nature can be frustrating; I felt the same dissatisfaction Isabel did of his refusal to discuss his past.  Isabel is his opposite, impetuous and determined, qualities that throughout the story serve to cultivate a selfish streak that will stun.  She knows only of her own suffering and the foundling is the means to a much-desired end.  This facet of Isabel's character can turn some readers off but I loved that Stedman gifted her story with such a deeply flawed woman, one that made me uncomfortable and angry but also worthy of my sympathies.Hannah Roennfeldt deserves the most commiseration, her plight the result of terribly unfortunate circumstance.  I appreciated how Stedman enabled the reader to experience her husband Frank's benevolence and liberality through her reminiscences of him and how she honored his memory in the end.  The rest of the characters are thoughtfully drawn despite their limited roles in the narrative; I even sensed quite an effervescent personality from Lucy-Grace (the foundling of the story) in the little dialogue she has in the book's closing chapters.Stedman's writing is lovely, emotive, and eloquent.  Her pacing (other than what I noted above) is efficient, immersing the reader in the gravity of the plot and rarely anchoring them to a comfortable spot.  Many of the happier moments that she gives to her main characters are bittersweet.  Tom and Isabel's love is tainted by sadness, as is Tom's affection for Lucy; he loves the child at arm's length, his guilty conscience not allowing his heart to embrace her completely.  Even when a wrong is put right, the resulting state of affairs is worse than the one before it and many characters struggle even further to come to terms with their situation.  The finale is also bittersweet, leaving a sort of what-might-have-been stigma attached to it.  This is not a light read - those who find such ethically profound stories too weighty for their sensibilities and/or want a happy ending for all will not enjoy this.This is a stellar debut from Stedman and I highly recommend it.  If not for the slow start, it would've been a 5-star book for me. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(4220, 4234)",1,0.0,False

I usually pick up one thing I loved about a book and write a review based on that thing I loved most and assume that other readers, as well as the author, can see what the book meant to me.  Turns out that isn't always the case and this book in particular- I want to write the review it deserves.Clarity has become extremely important to me this morning, after having finished Slammed.  Maybe none of this will mean anything to anyone else, but me and Colleen Hoover, but you are welcome to read, because this book blew me apart.It's true, I almost put it down.  I started reading and after 100 pages or so, I thought it was going to be just a story about a hot guy who lived across the street.  It was a nice story, but it didn't grab me by the throat.  The length of the story was daunting too: 1112 pages on my ereader, I think.  I put it down for a couple of months and then, recently, I realized I've gotten into a pattern of doing just that - not giving stories a chance if they don't drag me into them immediately.  I'm sure it's Sponge Bob Syndrome.But I made a decision to finish the books that hadn't quite pulled me in right away and this was the first.  And I'm sorry now that it took me so long to make the decision.  Hoover's written one of the best damn stories I've read in a long time, one of those books that moved me and inspired me and reduced me to tears.Once I picked it up again, I got to around page 200, or maybe it was even 250, and found out that the romance was not what I expected at all.  There was a fascinating twist that not only grabbed me by the throat, but dragged me through the book in less than a day.  I read while cooking dinner, eating dinner, standing, sitting, throwing the ball for the dogs, in between homework with the kids.  This book consumed me.Years ago I almost lost my father, then almost lost my mother within the span of the same year.  They both made it, but I was so close to losing them that it changed me  forever after.  Hoover's book relived some of that in me, healed some of it, and reiterated to me how books seem to be completely inspired.  I mean that they find you and speak directly to you and say things that would never be said between strangers otherwise.  This one spoke to me and resonated my soul like a tuning fork.  When I neared 1007 pages, the length of the novel suddenly seemed too short.The romance in this book was stunning, real, and beautifully written.  The enormous metaphor of finding a love that can also teach you about yourself and about life was mind-blowingly well done and the careful treatment of death and how we deal with it was heartbreaking and complete and amazing.  The poetry is incredible and artful on it's own and within its placement in the book.  The small details in the Halloween costumes and the carving pumpkins and the crazy categorizing...all of it made me cry and hurt and heal and call my parents to tell them again that I love them.  It made me reach out and touch my husband's feet when he came to bed and it insisted that I get up in the early, early morning and go kiss my children before they woke.This book made me cry.And this book made me feel alive.Colleen Hoover and I don't know each other.  But I feel like I've met her through her book and that she's told me a few things about life that will become part of the way I handle it, as do all the books and movies and people and situations that impact us in our lives.That is the magic of books.And that is the powerful story you get with Slammed.I highly recommend you grab yourself some of that magic.

I loved every minute of this book and would highly recommend it to any fans of NA contemporary books.Opening Sentence: Natalie has been twirling that same lock of hair for the past ten minutes and it's starting to drive me nuts.The Review:Have you ever felt like you didn't belong in your own life? That every day you do your ordinary routine is a day you have wasted.  That is how 20 year old Camryn Bennett feels.  Over the last few years everything that she ever cared about was destroyed.  The love of her life died in a car accident, her parents got divorced, her brother went to jail, and to top it off her best friend just stopped talking to her because of a stupid boy.  Cam decides that she needs a change and she needs it now.  She spontaneously goes to the Greyhound bus station and buys a ticket to the first place she thinks of, Idaho.  At first the excitement of doing the unexpected lifts her spirits tremendously, but then the fear of having no plan and nowhere to go starts to settle in until she meets Andrew.Andrew's father is dying of cancer and he really doesn't want to have to deal with it.  His brothers said it is getting close and if he wants to say goodbye he needs to come now.  Andrew needs time to think, so instead of flying to Wyoming he decides to take the bus.  At first he starts to regret taking the bus, but then he meets the beautiful Camryn and his life changes forever.  Andrew didn't know that he had a big hole in his life until Camryn filled it. As the two travel the country together they discover that some things are just meant to be, and love comes when you're not expecting it.The story is told from a dual point of view between Cam and Andrew.  First you meet Cam, she is a very depressed young woman that can't seem to get out of a rut.  Everything in her life seems to be unraveling at the seams and she needs to get away from it all.  Cam was easy to connect with, because I feel that most people are in her shoes at one point or another in their lives.  They feel stuck and don't really know how to go forward.  The great thing about Cam is she finally does something about it.  She takes a step in the right direction, even if it's not the most safe or realistic thing to do, at least she is doing something.  She is a very passionate girl that doesn't want to open her heart to anyone ever again.  But as her relationship with Andrew develops you slowly see her change and become a whole new better person.  She is shy to be herself because she is afraid that others won't accept her, but with Andrew's help she is able to overcome her fears.  I loved that she could be so honest and open with Andrew about anything and everything.  She discovers so much about herself on her journey.  I loved Cam, she was relatable in so many ways and her story is encouraging.Andrew is very different from Cam.  He is confidant, charming and of course gorgeous.  His story is very heartbreaking as well, his father has cancer and the end is coming.  Andrew has always looked up to his father, he taught him to be a strong person and to never let others tear you down.  You don't let others see your emotions and you never give up.  Andrew has a lot of anger in him and he doesn't know how to express himself very well.  He has a quick temper and he is very protective.  Once he notices Cam, he is instantly intrigued by her.  His relationship with Cam makes him come to peace with a lot of things in his life.  She fills holes he never knew existed, and she is a constant strength in the hard times he is experiencing.  Andrew is very sweet and I adored him. He and Cam complete each other and together they make each other a better person.In The Edge of Never you have two young people who felt completely lost until fate brings them together and they become complete.  This book was so beautifully done; it is hard to put into words how wonderful it was.  There were moments that made me blush, moments that made me laugh, moments that made me cry, but best of all, it gave me a resounding sense of hope.  No matter what the situation is you're going through in life you can always get through it if you have the right people to help you.  The love story was beautiful and watching it unfold through the pages was an unforgettable experience.  The characters were amazing and I can't wait to see where there journey takes them in the sequel to this great book.

This book is a Science Fiction thriller that combines elements of conspiracy, alien technology,  the lost city of Atlantis, and Nazis.The premise revolves around  the human race on the brink of extinction at some point in the past and then for some unexplained reason, humans made a giant leap forward in the evolutionary ladder that allowed them to not only survive, but to take control of Earth. Dr. Kate Warner is an expert on human evolution. She is living in Jakarta Indonesia studying and seeking a cure for autism. One day while working on a new treatment with a pair of her autistic children, armored soldiers move in, ransack the facility, and steal the children. Shortly thereafter, agent David Vale shows up on the scene and he and Kate are sucked into a worldwide race against time to save not only themselves and the children, but quite possibly the whole world.The story is solid, but not really different from a James Rollins book.

The before stuff was still good, it really gave us a good chance to see the Capitol as a whole and the role that they played in the story. It was also a great time to lay character foundations. I think that the whole first half of the book is evidence that THE HUNGER GAMES is not a stand-alone novel. There's just too much setting up for it to get far enough into the story that it'll be done at the end of 374 pages.The fact that Collins did spend so much time in character and plot development really is a plus. It definitely gives the reader time to connect to the characters. Even though we don't see Gale for long, we know that he's the most loyal best friend there is.

No matter what the Capitol, or anyone else, threw at him I always felt like he was an honest, caring person.Since the majority of the book was about Katniss fighting for her life, there really wasn't a chance to develop much romance. It's constantly in the undercurrent because of their strategy, but any real romantic connection between Katniss and Peeta seems improbable and far-fetched. But I understand that. Either way, I'd almost like to announce myself as Team Peeta, but I feel like we aren't far enough into the love story to make any definitive conclusions ;).Overall, THE HUNGER GAMES is a whirlwind of a story that takes you on the incredible journey of a girl fighting to live.

I don't think it translates as well in the crime/mystery/suspense genres. Again, MacDonald is the most perfect example.I apologize to her most hard-core fans for this heart-felt, honest criticism. Again, I couldn't finish the book, and so I returned to one of my favorites: Stephen King. It was like a home coming for me. The prose was suddenly flowing again, with ease. As if I had taken a stool softener. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1449, 1463)",1,0.0,False

However, there were a handful of items that we couldn't get right with the site so I started reading this book.Like other books, it does a great job walking through what Wordpress is, how to setup and establish and account and also walks through the upsides and downsides of where to install the software (depends on who your host servicer is and what you want to be able to customize).  It was a lot of stuff I didn't have to worry about but I found it interesting nonetheless.Since I was interested in very specific questions, I turned to the index to look up some key words.  My first one was customizing menus.  So I found the menu section and began reading, in detail, about how to customize menus and (the part I really needed to know) how to create drop down menus.  We had been pulling our hair out trying to get drop down menus and no plugins were working.  The book has a great section that gives you the code to add so drop down menus appear.  We also learned that certain themes don't support all features so we ended up having to make some minor changes (which this book also walks you through in great detail).The difference between this book and the other book I mentioned is the detail.  This book goes into a lot of detail IF YOU NEED IT on how to do just about everything.  You can just skim through it as well and get valuable information but I enjoyed reading about the writers specific examples of problems they had with their own blogs/sites and how they were corrected.  Also, I appreciate the writing style as it is written in a way that feels more like a conversation with someone that is explaining it.  Step by step guides can be helpful but having real life stories and examples work better for my train of thought.The one area that this book is lacking is in the illustrations.  The book uses black and white photos rather than large detailed photos like the other book I have so I've found those to less useful.  However, when you get this book, it also gives you access to online tutorials that allow to you to ""follow the bouncing ball"" or the step by step guide that a lot for people like.  This is a nice add on feature to the book and possibly a good way to introduce updates to the book if the writer chooses to do so.  I am not a huge fan of having information like this in two places (one in the book and one online) as I am usually looking for instant gratification but its good to know that if I get stuck, I can refer to the online area.Overall, this book is a very easy to understand for beginners yet detailed enough for advanced users of Wordpress.  I highly recommend this book for those of you looking to go beyond a basic blog or website and want more control and customization features within Wordpress.

The author goes to great lengths to insult academics and those in the business community and to elevate himself in a one sided dialogue with the reader.  Its baffling and childish.  Antifragile is about things which gain in strength from volatility (or more broadly do well from uncertainty).  The author argues that people generally misevaluate the distribution of outcomes and as a result unerappreciate the uncertainty we face and put themselves in positions that are brittle to change.  That in itself is a relatively useful insight, though it is not original despite the author constantly trying to convince everyone he is the only person who understands this idea.The author seems to spend 95% of his time reading classics rather than what people in the modern world write and research and seems to have had some horrible interpersonal relationships with his former colleagues in the bank and in academics (probably because he can't articulate his points properly and doesnt have a logical process when making arguments).  The result is that he spends a lot of time insulting people on his perception of their beliefs when in fact most people appreciate all of his points and have made the same arguments a long time ago.  The author is not mathematical but tries to make out that he is and talks about the non-linearities of phenomenon which any literate person knows is not linear and claims these are very insightful ideas.  For example much time is spent about dropping objects from small heights multiple times vs dropping the same object from a great height and the fragility of the object is non-linear.  Ideas like this are trivial and a function of kinetic energy, among other things, which, yes, is non linear with respect to velocity.  To lecture and insult technical people about a high school physics idea and claim no one gets it is beyond unimpressive.  The author constantly tells the reader his professors were all fools who didnt understand what they were teaching because they only think in the context of their fields.  He talks about how he fooled his business school professors by using language they didnt understand.  He talks about how he knew the same things as Mandelbrot despite never reading it (which reinforces the fact that perhaps the author is less informed than he realizes).  He talks about how no one gets it (when they do because the points are simple).  I try to be an avid reader and even works where the authors tone was condescending I try to look through it to measure the content.  This is the first time I found it almost unbearable to finish.

It was exciting, horrifying, mysterious, curious, and terribly interesting. I was totally hooked from start to finish.THE DREAM THIEVES picks up where THE RAVEN BOYS left off&#8230;. So if you have read THE RAVEN BOYS (which I suggest you do), there WILL be spoilers for book one in this review&#8230; Just watch out! So Ronan. He left us with quite a little shocker at the end of book one and that is what book two is allllll about &#8212; dreams. Um. YES PLEASE. You know (actually you probably don&#8217;t know) that I usually get annoyed when characters have these weird symbolic dreams that represent what&#8217;s going on in their life or are predicting the future. I just think it&#8217;s overdone and I tend to roll my eyes at those silly dreams. This book? Nothing like that! The whole dream aspect is freaking amazing. I absolutely love the idea that Maggie Steifvater came up with for the concept of this second book.Now&#8230; For those who have read THE RAVEN BOYS (which I&#8217;m you&#8217;re still reading by this point, I&#8217;m assuming it&#8217;s all of you), THE DREAM THIEVES is actually quite different plot-wise. Yes, we still have all the same major characters and the same basic plot points (ley lines, Cabeswater, Glendower, and Blue&#8217;s forbidden kiss) but TDT delves so much more into Ronan&#8217;s side of the story and we get more answers about Chainsaw, his dreams, and even his father&#8217;s mysterious death (which I was dying to know about in TRB). I actually hooked on to this book more than I did book one because it was that much more mystical/paranormal/AWESOME versus all the business with Gansey & Glendower because let&#8217;s face it&#8230; It was hard (for me) to get into the mythology/history of Glendower in book one. In TDT, Glendower is much more an underlying factor to several events that keep the plot moving versus and actual main plot point. I was incredibly invested in Ronan&#8217;s story line! ALSO. There&#8217;s this guy called The Grey Man&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. You&#8217;ll find out more about him in the book but Heidi (Bunbury in the Stacks) and I had a nice conversation about him. Kind of love him as a character (not in a swoony way &#8212; Just the way his character was planned out&#8230; So perfect.)Honestly the only reason I didn&#8217;t give this book a full five star knock out review was for two reasons: One being that Maggie Steifvater&#8217;s writing in The Raven Cycle series is beautiful and twisted, but sometimes I feel like the style is a bit over my head, if that makes sense. I get the feeling that if I was an English major or something that this would have totally made sense&#8230; Like there was something I was missing as far as class or knowledge of writing styles. I don&#8217;t know how else to say that, but I just felt like the writing was a little over my head at times and it got complicated for me to follow. I&#8217;m not saying I wanted Maggie to write everything so boring and straightforward, but me personally &#8212; I just got lost in the writing style just a bit. The second thing preventing me from giving it a flat out five star review was that I just had expectations for a little bit more from the ending. It was certainly good and very exciting, but I guess I just expected it to end similar to book one (though I don&#8217;t know why since this was so different) but it was just a little different than what I expected so I was slightly thrown. I actually thought part of it was a bit fantastical for the way the whole book went (which is a silly thing to say considering the whole book was awesomely fantastical), but I just felt like this one scene didn&#8217;t fit the mood of the rest of the book. And this didn&#8217;t affect my overall opinion too much, but I would have loved to see that magic of Cabeswater in detail again! I just loved that in TRB.That aside, I think fans of THE RAVEN BOYS will absolutely be wowed by THE DREAM THIEVES! There were so many amazing elements to this story, new and exciting characters, answers from previous mysteries and new ones to look forward to.

And I'm so glad that I finally decided to do so. I've been meaning to re-read it ever since I downloaded Rebel for review back in January. But I was nervous. I was nervous about not loving it the same way this second time, as it has been more than a year since I first read it. But I shouldn't have worried. Because I loved it so much. I still think Reboot is an amazing book. It is exciting and fun and full of amazing romance. I'm so happy that I finally read it again. It's awesome.I'm not going to recap the book in this recommendation of mine. Because I feel that I would end up talking for ages, lol. But I will say that the plot in Reboot is amazing. I enjoyed it so much. It's exciting and surprising and full of action. And the romance. Swoon. More on that soonish. There is a lot of death in this book. But I didn't really mind. Except for this one death. That broke my heart. But it also made sense, and I think I would have made the same choice. Sniffs. But yes. It was very heartbreaking.Reboot is told from the point of view of seventeen year old Wren. Who is all kinds of amazing. I loved her. And I loved reading about her. At first she doesn't feel all that much. Which I didn't mind. But then Callum arrives and she starts to change. And I loved that so much. I think she ended up an even better person. But anyway. I adored reading about her. I adored her scars, even though they shame her. I think she's beautiful. And agh. I really loved reading about her and cannot wait to get to know more of her.Wren is a Reboot. There are a lot of them in this book. And that was such an awesome plot twist. I loved getting to know stuff about them. How much stronger they are than other humans. How fast they heal. How different they are as well. So awesome. Wren has been dead for 178 minutes, which is the most at the moment. What she had to go through was so heartbreaking to read about. Yet I wanted to read more and more. Sigh. I just love to torture myself, don't I? lol. But yeah. I thought the Reboots were amazing.One of the things I loved the most about Wren was her roommate and friend, Ever. I adored her as well. But I really loved their friendship. It gets better and more real after Callum arrives. And they are just too cute. Sigh. Ever is amazing. Though holy crap. Such awful things happen with her. Heartbreak. But also so interesting to read about. It was amazing. Sigh. There are a few other characters in this book that I liked as well. Like Addie. Would like to get to know her more as well. She did seem awesome.Then, of course, there is Callum. Who is a Twenty-Two. Which is a very low number for a Reboot. It means that he has more emotions that the others, and is more human. And sigh. I loved that. Because Callum is amazing. I loved reading about him so much. And I loved getting to know him. I loved how he was with Wren. He is horrified with how many she has killed, but I feel like he accept her. I hope. The romance is very sweet in this book. It made me grin like crazy. Callum is just all kinds of amazing.I don't want to say more about this book. Just that it is incredible. And I need you all to read it. Especially since the last book, Rebel, is coming out in less than a month. &lt;3 Though, yeah, I'm reading it in a moment since I have a review copy of it :D And I cannot wait. I need to know what happens next. Anyway. Reboot is a stunning novel. I loved it. And I loved the writing as well. Just loved everything about it. Sigh. I also cannot wait to read more books by Amy Tintera. She's pretty amazing as well.~He slid his hand into mine and leaned over to press a soft kiss onto my cheek.

Heartbreak. But also so interesting to read about. It was amazing. Sigh. There are a few other characters in this book that I liked as well. Like Addie. Would like to get to know her more as well. She did seem awesome.Then, of course, there is Callum. Who is a Twenty-Two. Which is a very low number for a Reboot. It means that he has more emotions that the others, and is more human. And sigh. I loved that. Because Callum is amazing. I loved reading about him so much. And I loved getting to know him. I loved how he was with Wren. He is horrified with how many she has killed, but I feel like he accept her. I hope. The romance is very sweet in this book. It made me grin like crazy. Callum is just all kinds of amazing.I don't want to say more about this book. Just that it is incredible. And I need you all to read it. Especially since the last book, Rebel, is coming out in less than a month. &lt;3 Though, yeah, I'm reading it in a moment since I have a review copy of it :D And I cannot wait. I need to know what happens next. Anyway. Reboot is a stunning novel. I loved it. And I loved the writing as well. Just loved everything about it. Sigh. I also cannot wait to read more books by Amy Tintera. She's pretty amazing as well.~He slid his hand into mine and leaned over to press a soft kiss onto my cheek.

I saw the hype on every blog imaginable. My Goodreads feed was bogged down with hundreds of emotional status updates. And nine out of ten reviews were five stars. But I still put off reading it until my co-blogger read it and loved it and told me I MUST read it. So I did. And I loved it. Now, the problem I'm having is writing a review that will do this book justice. I'm feeling defeated by this task. How do you write a review for a book that leaves you feeling dizzy with awe, breathless, speechless, gasping for air? So instead of writing a full review, I give you my...Top Five reasons why I fell hopelessly in love with Hopeless:1. Two words: Dean Holder.""Dean Holder? Messy brown hair? Smoldering blue eyes? A temper straight out of Fight Club?""Holder, with his Hopeless tattoo on his arm, is the kind of bad boy that you will fall hopelessly in love with. I fell hard for him. He's passionate, complicated, confident, fiercely protective, and witty. He has lickable dimples and a coma-inducing hot body. And every time he walked on to the pages, he gave me butterflies. And last, but certainly not least, he cuddles. Yep, Holder is book boyfriend worthy.""When I touch you, I'm touching you because I want to make you happy. When I kiss you, I'm kissing you because you have the most incredible mouth I've ever seen and you know I can't not kiss it. And when I make love to you--I'm doing exactly that. I'm making love to you because I'm in love with you."" - Holder2. Sky Davis, our heroine, is a wonderful, smart, saucy, technologically challenged, snarky, broken but strong, brave, book lover, kind of weird in a cool way, beautiful inside and out, and I would love to have been friends with her in high school. Sky has never felt much, or anything, with a boy the way that Holder makes her feel. Up until they meet, any other boy has made her feel numb. And Holder made her feel everything...especially lust. Lust is a whole new feeling to Sky and she didn't know what to do with it at first. It was awkward for her. And her confusion over her new feelings was endearing and funny at the same time.""I've never been swept off my feet. I don't get butterflies. In fact the whole idea of being swooned by anyone is foreign to me... Somehow, in the course of sixty seconds, this guy has managed to swoon me, then terrify the hell out of me."" - Sky3. The passion and fire between these two is so incredibly real and intense. The way they felt towards one another is beautiful. Almost magical. And holy sexual tension... these two have the best non-kiss ever. I think I held my breath the entire time they non-kissed. Holder is one sexy mofo with his teasing kisses on Sky's neck, cheek, eyebrow, shoulder...everywhere but the lips. That scene melted my butter.""Sky, I'm not kissing you tonight but believe me when I tell you, I've never wanted to kiss a girl more. So stop thinking I'm not attracted to you because you have no idea just how much I am. You can hold my hand, you can run your fingers through my hair, you can straddle me while I feed you spaghetti, but you are not getting kissed tonight. And probably not tomorrow, either. I need this. I need to know for sure that you're feeling every single thing that I'm feeling the moment my lips touch yours. Because I want your first kiss to be the best first kiss in the history of first kisses."" - Holder4. The secondary characters. Six is Sky's first best friend in the whole wide world and she is absolutely the coolest chick. She walks to the beat of her drum. I love her blas&eacute; attitude. I love her uplifting texts to Sky. I love how she loves Sky. I love how Sky and Six are so different but also so much alike. And they simply accept each other for who they are. This is a true girl-mance at its best.""Sky, you are beautiful. You are possibly the most exquisite creature in the universe and if anyone tells you otherwise, I'll cut a bitch."" (Text message from Six to Sky)""Only one day at public school and the bitches already made your locker rain?"" she laughs. ""Impressive."" - SixAnd then there is the sassy, bold, and funny Breckin. On Sky's first day of school, he befriends her right away and becomes her second best friend in the whole wide world. He's gay, Mormon, and proud. Breckin rocks.""Breckin shrugs. ""I'm new here. And if you haven't deducted from my impeccable fashion sense, I think it's safe to say that I'm..."" he leans forward and cups his hand to his mouth in secrecy. ""Mormon,"" he whispers."" - Breckin5. The writing is amazing. Miz Hoover knows how to write an emotionally-charged story that made me feel every single word deep inside my soul. My mind went through a smattering of emotions that range from smiling and laughing (a lot!), lust, falling in love with the characters, sadness, shock, worry, nervousness, disgust, grief, acceptance, and contentment. The writing is flawless. It flows from word to word smoothly, keeping me enthralled from the beginning to the very last page. Miz Hoover writes my kind of snarky and snappy humor. I laughed out loud on several occasions. The humor adds charm and lightness to a story that could've potentially been overly dark. And the characters are so vividly real, I felt like I was living their life. Oh, and the twist. When we learn about the twist about halfway through the book, my jaw fell on the ground. It was completely unpredictable.In case you haven't noticed by now, I loved this brilliantly told story. If you are one of the few people left, who love new adult romances, and hasn't read Hopeless, read the freaking book now! I can guarantee you are missing out.With that said, I will leave you with one of my most favorite scenes. Sky is my kind of gal. I love the way she thinks...""My locker seems to have become the hub for sticky notes and nasty letters, none of which I ever see actually being placed on or in my locker.

Where's the creativity in that? They couldn't back it up with an interesting story? Maybe a few details of my indiscretion? If I have to read this s*** every day, the least they could do is make it interesting. If I was going to stoop so low as to leave an unfounded note on someone's locker, I'd at least have the courtesy of entertaining whoever reads it in the process. I'd write something interesting like, ""I saw you in bed with my boyfriend last night. I really don't appreciate you getting massage oil on my cucumbers. Whore.""I laugh and it feels odd, laughing out loud at my own thoughts.

The book is segmented into the various stages of Theo's transition from teenager into adulthood, moving about the country, with the constant MacGuffin reminder of ""his"" painting. There are multiple stories to be enjoyed, my favorite being Theo's family life, as well as introductions to the gangster-ridden art underworld.Tartt hits the top of her crescendos when Theo is left alone, where his mind can stew. Not many authors are capable of solo scenes, but this is where Tartt shines. The last couple-of-hundred pages present the deepest of meta-philosophical thought that carries through long after the book's closure. Make no mistake, the rest of the book is treasured--her dialogue is realistic and always in conflict--but Theo's solo scenes were my personal highlight.People interested in literature should take no second thoughts of diving in headfirst. Writers should study this book as if it were classic art. Lexiconists will appreciate the careful assembly of words. If you've been waiting to read a book of great literary value, this is it.

There are multiple stories to be enjoyed, my favorite being Theo's family life, as well as introductions to the gangster-ridden art underworld.Tartt hits the top of her crescendos when Theo is left alone, where his mind can stew. Not many authors are capable of solo scenes, but this is where Tartt shines. The last couple-of-hundred pages present the deepest of meta-philosophical thought that carries through long after the book's closure. Make no mistake, the rest of the book is treasured--her dialogue is realistic and always in conflict--but Theo's solo scenes were my personal highlight.People interested in literature should take no second thoughts of diving in headfirst. Writers should study this book as if it were classic art. Lexiconists will appreciate the careful assembly of words. If you've been waiting to read a book of great literary value, this is it.

There's been a lot of buzz about the fact that this book wasn't popular when it was by an unknown author and then became bestselling after people found out it was written by J.K. Rowling. This has led to speculation about what this means for the publishing industry, what it means for unknown authors trying to get published, etc. I DON'T CARE ABOUT ANY OF THAT. True, I may not have picked up this book if it hadn't been written by Ms. Rowling, but regardless, I did read it and I liked it, so there you go.Also, my husband kindly bought a copy of this for me on our recent trip to London, so I technically read the ""British"" version--I'm sure some things have been ""Americanized"" in the version available in the U.S., but I'm guessing there aren't any substantive differences.All disclaimers aside, I thought this was a really, REALLY well done private investigator procedural. The plot was exciting, and I thought the characters were marvelous. J.K. Rowling is such a keen observer of people, I think, and it really shows in her writing. Cormoran Strike, our hero, is perfectly flawed in just the way I love characters to be.There was such an interesting dynamic between the two main characters, unlike any I have ever read. Cormoran Strike is the private investigator, and Robin is a temp who shows up at Strike's office on a Monday morning. However, Strike thought he canceled the temp arrangement, due to the fact that he has pretty much no money. The scene where Robin and Strike meet (actually physically crash into each other) is just so perfect. There's nothing overtly hilarious about it, but I love how Rowling uses subtle humor. For example, soon after Robin arrives for her first day of work, a client shows up (an extremely rare event). Robin does not want to let on to the client that she is not the regular secretary, thinking it will reflect poorly on Strike. So she suffers through Strike calling her Sandra multiple times, and then asks them very professionally if she can get them anything to drink. They both ask for coffee with sugar:-------------He saw her mouth twist as she closed the door behind her, and only then did he remember that he did not have any coffee, sugar or, indeed, cups.-------------I know what you're thinking--oh the characters get together and it's a romance, too! Nope. That's part of what I loved about it--it's such an unusual relationship to write. The down-on-his-luck PI trying to solve a difficult case and his temp secretary who he's just met trying to assist him. So original.The central mystery of the story is very well done, and I kept flipping the pages faster and faster to try to get to the bottom of it. At one point, I remember thinking to myself, ""There are literally 15 people who I think are possibly guilty at this point."" That's like Agatha Christie level of skill, people. It's Murder on the Orient Express, except, you know, without the train. And the way it did end I thought was completely masterful. Twist after twist and turn after turn, there is no way you will see it coming.We know Strike has a huge backstory, most of which we only get in bits and pieces throughout this novel. I guess that is my one and only complaint about this one--there were a lot of things that felt unfinished (and some parts that seemed like digressions from the main story)--but I suppose this makes sense for the first book in a series. I can't wait for future installments to find out more about what exactly happened to him in the army, why he left, more about the history between him and his ex-fianc&eacute;e, and to see if anything except mutual respect ever develops between him and Robin. There were also some interesting things alluded to about Robin's past, and I hope those are also explored in more detail.To me, the fact that this book is written by J.K. Rowling doesn't come as much of a surprise. Good writing: check. Well-developed characters with room for more development: check. Intricate and detail-oriented plot: check. Also, I read somewhere that if you think about it, the Harry Potter novels are sort of like thrillers/mysteries. So it's not surprising to me that Rowling can keep the page-turning suspense going, just using a slightly different medium.BOTTOM LINEI LOVED IT. I consumed like 100 pages of this book at a time. Seriously, if you are a fan of detective fiction, good writing, excellent characters, and a book that will continually keep you guessing, you should pick this one up. I personally can't wait to read more about the adventures of Cormoran Strike, PI, and am anxiously awaiting the second book in the series!

I think the writing is better, but the characters just don't compare.  J. k.

Friends of mine had given me the basic idea of the plot, and I thought it would be terrible.  I saw how popular this trilogy had become and assumed it was just another Twilight.  I was wrong.Although I wouldn't say that the series is as good as Harry Potter, I think it's a fair comparison.  I think the story is just as excellent; I think it's every bit as memorable.  I think the writing is better, but the characters just don't compare.  J. k. Rowling had a way with creating characters that I've never seen matched and that's where I think the Harry Potter series has the slight edge.  However, Katnis Everdeen has become one of my all time favorite characters from a book, so I'm not saying that the characters are bad.The main problem that I had that kept me from really loving this series was that there are so many physically incomprehensible things that happen over the course of the story that I could not overlook.Overall, though, my opinion is very favorable.

After coming back from a mission she sees through the glamour of the shape shifter who is impersonating her mother figure character, Raquel. Turns out the shape shifter is named Lend. He's male. He's hot. He is the love interest. Unfortunately you also have Reth (Lorethen) who is the evil/beautiful/scary Fairy who is basically trying to stalk her.  I might add right here that I much prefer fairies over vampires and find it so sad that they are used more in literature. Oh, and if your teen loves vampires - they LOOK like nasty rotting corpses to Evie. You might want to warn the teen in question.Anyhow this is the first book in a series so of course we don't get real closure. The whole idea of being able to see through glamour is not unique - it's in all the older fairy tales I'm glad to see it's making its way back into literature. The way the idea is portrayed though makes it make sense. I won't ruin the story by giving out spoilers to the rest just know that someone is killing paranormals as well as killing a large group of the International Paranormal Containment Agency (Evie's group).At the same time though I admit that some of the story felt very Mary Sue-ish. Finding Evie forces the whole Agency to become an international one as EVERYONE wants access to Evie. So in that - the book fails. Overall very good book, and I felt it was thin enough that you could probably get away with giving it to reluctant Readers.Before I forget- 4 stars for me means that I enjoyed reading it, but would not have it on my own personal shelf.

Where Christopher has his very obvious and real limitations, his parents are enmired in equally debilitating and more stupid squabbles and jealousies. Christopher's issues come across to me as more real. He doesn't like people to touch him for a very good reason - because it hurts. He was certainly the most sympathetic character in the book, but also the bravest, the most honorable, the smartest, the wisest, the fairest, the one with the most interesting life. Everybody else in the book was sort of flat and predictable by comparison. He was the hero. He had a future you wanted to know about. At least that's how I saw it. And in real life, as I experience it, it can really be that way. For that reason, autism isn't this gigantic tragedy to me. Yes, you wonder who will hire him and love him when you are gone, and no, he wasn't prom king. But there are plenty of compensations if you can get past all that.I've read some reviews about how Christopher fails to understand the tragedy of his parent's divorce, because autistic people have no empathy and so on and so forth. I beg to differ. Christopher is initially motivated by his love for a dog, and a sense of the injustice done to the dog. But his other big move is to go to London, which wouldn't have happened if he hadn't cared about his mother. He explains that the reason he has an easier time with animals is that they don't lie to him. He understands their minds and can trust them to be faithful and honest... it's not about lack of empathy for people. Every autistic person I know well is deeply empathetic. Because of (for example) the stupid fights he sees his parents go through, people have to do more to gain his trust. Autism is seen as a disability, because people like Christopher don't get some really big things, like that his father isn't going to kill him. But Christopher doesn't get his father for the same reason his father doesn't get him - because their brains are wired differently. In this sense, Christopher isn't any dumber or less empathetic or less rational than his father, and Haddon conveys this beautifully.Christopher and his father are thrown into this world with different brains, but with the same desire to create a meaningful life.

No matter what kind of horrors you see, you can't seem to turn away. If nothing else, it hooked me in and kept me reading to the very last page. Beautiful Disaster goes places I never expected when reading the synopsis. It was completely addicting!Beautiful Disaster is a book that I'm sure many people will love. I loved it. I had some issues with the characters behavior toward one another (the irrational possessiveness, and dependency that bordered on stalking mostly), but that's who these characters are. That's how their story goes and I appreciated that. I definitely recommend Beautiful Disaster to anyone who likes contemporary or romance, but this is definitely a book for the older YA crowd. It's not too explicit, but it has it's moments. ANSWERNOTFOUND",by Jamie McGuire,"(19, 35)",1,0.0,False

Nothing much happens in the first 70 pages, but then things get really interesting. In a culture where conservative Christianity is an integral part of every aspect of life, this 7-year-old is quickly faced with a dilemma: lie and be guilty of sin, or tell the truth and risk his family's livelihood (and possibly his own neck). Indeed, the mixed messages that he receives concerning religious beliefs are confusing for a child (and for honest grownups as well). Even more confusing are the early stirrings of sexual attraction toward a girl ten years his senior. This subject is handled in a very tasteful manner, and it inevitably leads, of course, to childhood heartbreak. (Not as serious a heartbreak as the baseball season ending with his beloved Cardinals in third place, however!) He witnesses things a child should never have to see (including two murders) and, as a result, has to grow up faster than most kids his age. His whole style and use of language is fairly mature for a 7-year-old.Unfortunately the last several chapters are not quite as gripping as the middle part of the novel, and the story sort of fizzles out at the end, keeping me from giving it the highest rating.

Was Nick's upbringing and his father part of the reason he felt it so difficult to connect with and empathise with his wife?

But for the most part, Nick, Amy, their parents and friends are either quite self-centred, arrogant people or they don't play a big enough role to really have an impact.And the million dollar question - the ending?

Jacob is a sixteen year old loner - not by choice - who spends a great deal of his time with his Grandpa, Abraham Portman; a man who escaped nazi-invested Poland as a child and moved into a peculiar home off the coast of Wales. Grandpa Portman claims the home was full of peculiar children with special gifts, but Jacob lost faith in that story years ago.After Grandpa Portman's death, at the hands of what Jacob thinks is a monster, he ventures - with his father - to the island where the home stands. This is when things start to get better and better. The sense of mystery, and even a little trepidation, jumps off the page. Jacob isn't sure if he's just a little crazy or if he should believe the stories his grandfather told him. He flips between the two thoughts and being a part of his uncertainty creates an eeriness. I never knew what to expect or what was going to happen. Each detail is revealed slowly and with care. Learning more about Jacob's grandpa unravels the mystery about the island and the children, but also about the person that Abraham Portman once was.The photos that go along with the peculiar children are creepy and help to bring the story to life.

Every year twelve districts all around the totalitarian country of Panem must send one boy and one girl as &#34;Tributes&#34; into the Hunger Games, a contest between the districts that awards the winning district with fame and glory and lots and lots of resources from the government. What an excellent concept this is, from a political standpoint. It keeps the upper class citizens of Panem, who reside at the capital, happy and entertained, while the bottom of the pyramid, the Districts, fight against each other, making a full-blown rebellion all but impossible. Of course, this year's Games is not like any of the other games. There can be only one victor, but it is Katniss's defiant spirit that causes the greatest upset to the games Panem has ever seen.As a first-person limited novel, much of the history of Collins's world is left to conjecture. Katniss is a strong observer, but not an omniscient one, not by a long shot. She can only provide her own guesses, which we adopt and add to, as to what is happening outside of the Games that she is currently participating in. However, the strength of this perspective lies in giving us, the readers, unlimited access to the deepest recesses of Katniss's mind. We effectively become Katniss Everdeen, the defiant girl who started a spark of revolution throughout the nation.The character development is good. We get to know not only Katniss, but also the characters she comes across. But perhaps it is Haymitch's character that steals the show. His attitude toward life, teetering between sarcastic scorn and PTSD, reflects the attitudes of some soldiers who return from combat. According to Collins, such is actually her source material for the characters and plot, the exploration of combat and its effects on young soldiers. As this is the first novel in the series, we still have yet to see any significant development of Gale and Peeta, both of whom remain rather static throughout the novel. Peeta starts off weak, he ends off weak, getting wounded and hiding in the mud as opposed to Katniss, who becomes a huntress of people.The plot and pacing are good, though it's a little slow for the first third of the book. Collins uses this first part to develop the main backstory of Panem, dedicating the latter half to the actual Games itself. Once we step into the arena, however, it's no holds barred and everything you've ever known just flies out the window.This is by no means a thorough review of the novel. I have only read it once and that was over a year ago, so I'm going on very shallow memory right now. Overall, it is an enjoyable novel, the start of something that could have been, but failed to launch with Mockingjay. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3457, 3471)",2,0.0,False

I don't have the Pimsleur one but I did buy the U.S. Foreign Service Insitute course in addition to Thomas's, and so I thought I'd make a few comments by way of comparing them in case you find them useful in choosing the right course for you.I have to say Thomas is a gifted teacher and he has a very interesting approach requiring no notes or rote memorization. He also stresses the importance of a natural, stress-free learning environment. Thomas is a savvy guy here as this is probably one of the major stumbling blocks for the new language learner, and so he puts the student at ease right from the very beginning--a nice touch there and I give him points for that.The second cornerstone to Thomas's method is the simulated classroom environment where you work along with two other people in the class, a man and a woman. The third, and perhaps most important aspect of Thomas's course is his memorization and note-free system of learning. Thomas starts with very simple sentences and builds up from there so the student acquires the syntax almost intuitively as he goes along. Thomas also discusses differences in pronunciation as he goes, too.You build vocabulary as you go along also, with Thomas empasizing cognates or words that are almost identical in the two languages initially. Overall, Thomas has done a very nice job here and I can see why people like Woody Allen and others say that his course is the only one that's ever worked for them.The Foreign Service Institute course is more traditional but also very good, and I like it, too. The audio tapes present the sentences and conversations while you follow along with the manual/workbook, which provides the translations. The workbook is very extensive and also has a more detailed discussion of the grammar than you'll get with either the Thomas or Pimsleur courses. There is an advantage to this since, although I think Thomas's method is probably fine for teaching the basic verb conjugations, such as present, past, and future, you're really not going to get a good idea of how the several subjective moods work in Spanish without some systematic study of the grammar there. English has the subjunctive, but it's practical a vestigial construction, but Spanish has it in spades and is a very active part of the language.On a side note, it would be interesting to see how Thomas's approach would work for a language with much simpler grammar than Spanish or French, such as Turkish or Japanese. Turkish has the wonderful distinction of being one of the few languages with no irregular verbs, and Japanese only has two. So at least as far as the verbal systems are concerned, they are much less complex than your typical European language, and the Indo-European languages in general. There are a few other more technical aspects to the two languages, of course, such as the case system in Turkish (which Japanese doesn't have), but verb conjugations are usually the most difficult aspects of the languages in most of the popular European ones because of all the irregular forms. And Spanish has at least 22 common verbs that are irregular in at least the present indicative tense, and many are irregular in several other ways.One other thing the Institute course does is to provide substitution drill sections where you're required to substitute a particular word, and then give the sentence, with any needed changes. This is useful for practicing the verb conjugations and other things. I have a pretty strong background in grammar and linguistics in general so I don't mind slogging through dry discussions of grammar too much, but if you're not someone who enjoys that sort of thing, Thomas's approach may be the one for you.

Clearly, the guy has got something going for him. And whatever else you might say about The Da Vinci Code and its successors in the Robert Langdon series, lots of people read them.Far be it from me to advance some psychosexual explanation for this surprising phenomenon. The numbers don't lie. I can only wonder why.OK, admittedly, I've read all those Dan Brown novels. Yes, I admit it. And I even found the suspense in the first couple of them to be compelling. Brown's early novels -- Digital Fortress and Deception Point -- were fascinating to me. And I couldn't wait to get to the end of The Da Vinci Code because the historical mystery was brilliant and the suspense was excruciating.Inferno, not so much. Although there were many surprises in store for me in the book's final chapters, I'd already figured out some of the fast ones Brown was going to pull as he thundered toward the climax. Because, often enough, it's possible to foresee the plotline based not on what an author writes as on what he doesn't write. That sometimes smacks of manipulation, which invariably makes me uncomfortable.Now, just in case you want to know what Inferno is about, listen up: Robert Langdon finds himself in a hospital bed in Florence with a raging headache and a case of short-term amnesia. He can't remember a thing about the past three days, and he doesn't have a clue why the back of his head is bandaged or how or why he got to Florence. Sienna Brooks, his physician -- a lovely young blonde woman, of course! Hollywood must be appeased -- tells him he's been shot in the head. Meanwhile, we are introduced to a shadowy character who runs a mysterious and powerful global organization from his headquarters on a massive converted yacht anchored somewhere in the Adriatic. He appears to be mixed up in Langdon's misadventure in some way, but it's clear we won't figure out how until we've read further in the book. Pretty soon another mysterious character -- a spike-haired woman in black leather, somewhat resembling Lisbeth Salander, the girl with the dragon tattoo -- appears and starts shooting up the hospital, killing one of the doctors. Langdon and Brooks flee to her nearby flat, where . . . well, the plot thickens there. You get the point, right?I'll say this much for Brown: his writing seems to have improved a bit since Angels & Demons, and the man does do his research. Dante Alighieri, whose work is the centerpiece of this novel, emerges from the pages of Inferno as a living force in Italy and among scholars the world over. And, as usual in his later, blockbuster career, Brown presents himself in the mode of docent at an art museum, pointing out one priceless cultural treasure after another as the action shifts from Florence to Venice to Istanbul.You'll love this book if you like that sort of thing -- a travelogue for art aficionados dressed up as a novel. For my money, though, Inferno was too predictable (knowing Langdon from his previous outings), the art commentary was boring, and Brown's treatment of overpopulation -- another theme that figures prominently in the book -- was downright preachy. All in all, I found Inferno just a fairly good read. Caveat emptor. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3317, 3331)",1,0.0,False

The numbers don't lie. I can only wonder why.OK, admittedly, I've read all those Dan Brown novels. Yes, I admit it. And I even found the suspense in the first couple of them to be compelling. Brown's early novels -- Digital Fortress and Deception Point -- were fascinating to me. And I couldn't wait to get to the end of The Da Vinci Code because the historical mystery was brilliant and the suspense was excruciating.Inferno, not so much. Although there were many surprises in store for me in the book's final chapters, I'd already figured out some of the fast ones Brown was going to pull as he thundered toward the climax. Because, often enough, it's possible to foresee the plotline based not on what an author writes as on what he doesn't write. That sometimes smacks of manipulation, which invariably makes me uncomfortable.Now, just in case you want to know what Inferno is about, listen up: Robert Langdon finds himself in a hospital bed in Florence with a raging headache and a case of short-term amnesia. He can't remember a thing about the past three days, and he doesn't have a clue why the back of his head is bandaged or how or why he got to Florence. Sienna Brooks, his physician -- a lovely young blonde woman, of course! Hollywood must be appeased -- tells him he's been shot in the head. Meanwhile, we are introduced to a shadowy character who runs a mysterious and powerful global organization from his headquarters on a massive converted yacht anchored somewhere in the Adriatic. He appears to be mixed up in Langdon's misadventure in some way, but it's clear we won't figure out how until we've read further in the book. Pretty soon another mysterious character -- a spike-haired woman in black leather, somewhat resembling Lisbeth Salander, the girl with the dragon tattoo -- appears and starts shooting up the hospital, killing one of the doctors. Langdon and Brooks flee to her nearby flat, where . . . well, the plot thickens there. You get the point, right?I'll say this much for Brown: his writing seems to have improved a bit since Angels & Demons, and the man does do his research. Dante Alighieri, whose work is the centerpiece of this novel, emerges from the pages of Inferno as a living force in Italy and among scholars the world over. And, as usual in his later, blockbuster career, Brown presents himself in the mode of docent at an art museum, pointing out one priceless cultural treasure after another as the action shifts from Florence to Venice to Istanbul.You'll love this book if you like that sort of thing -- a travelogue for art aficionados dressed up as a novel. For my money, though, Inferno was too predictable (knowing Langdon from his previous outings), the art commentary was boring, and Brown's treatment of overpopulation -- another theme that figures prominently in the book -- was downright preachy. All in all, I found Inferno just a fairly good read. Caveat emptor. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3317, 3331)",1,0.0,False

Patch, on the other hand, seems almost insincere in his feelings. I didn't really buy it when he first told Nora how much he cared about her.

In that series, she showed she was able to create strong characters, move plot along quickly, deftly control the rise and fall in tension, and create moving scenes.  While there were some weak sections in the series  (sometimes the pace moved too quickly, settings often could have been more detailed, and a few characters could  have been more richly drawn), by the end she had crafted one of the best YA series to hit the shelves the past few years--a thoughtful, often dark, almost always rewarding series.I'm happy to report that with book one (and it is a book one--fair warning to those who prefer not to start a series until it's already completed) of The Hunger Games, there is no sophomore slump.  In fact, she returns with a starting book that is more tightly focused, more moving, more quickly paced, more thoughtful and provocative, and more fully and constantly tense throughout.The premise for the Hunger Games is admittedly somewhat derivative and one could come up with dozens of possible Hollywood-pitch-like pairings:  ""it's Survivor meets Running Man"", ""it's The Lottery meets The Most Dangerous Game"", ""it's  . . . "".  None of it matters.  What very often counts in a genre novel, where many of the same old premises, same old tropes, same old formulas, appear and reappear over the years is not the original starting point, but what you do with it.  What Hunger Games is, is good.The opening whisks us right through the premise in a few brief pages.  We're in a post-apocalyptic North America--in a dystopia named  Panem--a dystopia formed out of the remnants of civilization.  Panem is ruled from a rich Capital and has 12 districts that provide what is needed--food, coal, etc.  Outside the Capital the people are barely surviving, many starving and the rest close to it.  Years ago the 12 districts (actually, 13 at the time) rebelled and were brutally put down.  As ""repentance"" and as a form of cold reminder, every year each district sends one boy and one girl (chosen by lottery) to the Hunger Games-- a televised kill-or-be-killed event set in a huge arena.When Katniss's younger sister, Prim, is chosen by lottery, Katniss volunteers in her place, joining Peeta--the chosen boy from her district--in the Games.  All of this happens very fast in the book, as does the few days of training prior to the Games themselves.  Though the background is quick, it is efficiently concise. We get a clear sense of much of what we need to know:  what life is like for those in Katniss' district, what she is like, her relationship with her best friend Gale, her place in the family (she's become the one taking care of the family since her father died in a mining accident), the contrast between life in the Capital and life in the districts, etc. There isn't a lot of detail, and some readers will probably wish for more explanation, but what we have is sufficient.By the time the Games themselves start, we have a solid footing. Which is good, because once the Games do start, it's all pretty breathless as Katniss tries to survive.  There are a lot of action scenes--fights, things blowing up, desperate attempts to save wounded people, etc.--but Collins isn't interested in simply an episodic line of battles, one after the other, showing off various combat skills until the winner is left alone.Katniss faces many complex decisions--to what extent does she ""play"" to the watching crowd (a ""popular"" contestant can gain sponsors who can pay for gifts that can be the difference between life and death), can she really kill another human, whom can she trust, what motivates the people around her, what is her relationship to Peeta or Gale, what debts does one human own another, etc.  The third person point of view focuses on her actions and thoughts and so we struggle with those questions even as she does, all while we root for her to ""win"" through the discomfort of realizing what this means is that we're rooting for her to kill.We also come to care about Peeta, even as we wonder just what game, if any, he is playing.  And the relationship between the two of them is a major point of interest and tension. And while the other contestants, with one significant and moving exception, aren't painted in any sort of detail, we do get enough quick, concise brushstrokes for several of them to have distinct personalities (though one does wish more was done in this area).Along with getting us to care about the people, and not just the plot points, Collins also offers up some clear social criticism as well as some hints at much larger issues than these few characters or these single Games, both with regard to this created world and our own society.  And while the book ends resolved and can be read without fear of a cliffhanger, there is enough left hanging in the air that the reader wants to see what happens afterward.There really is very little to criticize in this book, though one point should be made clear. Collins does not shy away at all from the premise of 24 kids placed in a kill-or-be-killed situation. There is no deus ex machina that swoops down and stops the games before anyone is killed or miraculously cures/revives the killed contestant.  People die in this book.  In fact, most of the people die in this book. And our main character kills some of them.  And not by accident. Hunger Games is as dark as its premise promises and therefore it is not for the very young.A strong main character and several strong supporting ones.  Crystal clear if not particularly beautiful prose.  A constantly suspenseful plot.  A quick pace.  Moving scenes. A grim  tone that adds to the sense that actions matter. An author who has the courage of her ideas.  Social criticism.  Hints at a larger story to come.  A first book in a series that ends with enough resolution that  reader can stop here and be satisfied.  400 pages that pull you along effortlessly.  These positives more than outweigh the few very small negatives.  Highly recommended. ANSWERNOTFOUND",background,"(2483, 2493)",1,0.0,False

There is no deus ex machina that swoops down and stops the games before anyone is killed or miraculously cures/revives the killed contestant.  People die in this book.  In fact, most of the people die in this book. And our main character kills some of them.  And not by accident. Hunger Games is as dark as its premise promises and therefore it is not for the very young.A strong main character and several strong supporting ones.  Crystal clear if not particularly beautiful prose.  A constantly suspenseful plot.  A quick pace.  Moving scenes. A grim  tone that adds to the sense that actions matter. An author who has the courage of her ideas.  Social criticism.  Hints at a larger story to come.  A first book in a series that ends with enough resolution that  reader can stop here and be satisfied.  400 pages that pull you along effortlessly.  These positives more than outweigh the few very small negatives.  Highly recommended. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(6104, 6118)",1,0.0,False

Like The Hunger Games and Divergent, The Testing is a post-apocalyptic dystopia - the world is rehabilitating, several generations after the bombs were dropped. Food is growing again; the water is being slowly cleaned and the badlands are being reclaimed from the radiation and mutations. Things are tough, but it is much better than it was.Cia lives with her family in a small outpost, isolated from other communities. She lives in a large, apparently happy family invested in re-engineering order from the chaos. We pick up Cia's personal narrative at the point where she is about to graduate from high school.

However, all is not as it seems. Cia's father, a graduate of the University, warns her on the eve of her departure, to trust no-one. Haunted still by nightmares, he shares with Cia what knowledge he retains of his own testing - including a warning that each successful candidate's memory is wiped at the end of their Testing.

It isn't what Charbonneau draws for us with her words, rather what is left unspoken, unlit and subverted that speaks the loudest.I found the novel compelling. The characters are finely drawn and complex. The world-building is achieved early and well, without superfluity. Cia is perhaps the only truly honest person in the book. Everyone else has something to hide. Cia's challenge is to learn to limit her trust in others, while remaining true to her own ideals, and staying alive.

Like The Hunger Games and Divergent, The Testing is a post-apocalyptic dystopia - the world is rehabilitating, several generations after the bombs were dropped. Food is growing again; the water is being slowly cleaned and the badlands are being reclaimed from the radiation and mutations. Things are tough, but it is much better than it was.Cia lives with her family in a small outpost, isolated from other communities. She lives in a large, apparently happy family invested in re-engineering order from the chaos. We pick up Cia's personal narrative at the point where she is about to graduate from high school.

Nick&#8217;s back story immediately sucks you into the story, and Becca&#8217;s is no different.  Laura Kaye is so great being able to create characters that you immediately like and want to know more about; even if their experiences might not be relatable you root for them instantaneously.  I love the details of their homes and how it adds to their experiences and personalities so beautifully.  For example all the things that lay around Becca&#8217;s bedroom that mean so much to her really add to her as a person, adding pieces to her character.Also the chemistry between the two of them is so strong, that as a reader I got tense myself!  You immediately want Becca to kiss away all of Nick&#8217;s problems and do some other sexy things to his body as well.  The electricity between is undeniable and the buildup to that volcano is explosive!  The sex scenes in were the book were very very hot and I enjoyed watching Nick and Becca fall head over heels in love with each other.The action in this book is great as well, and it keeps you on your toes throughout the entire book.  I couldn&#8217;t put it down because the suspense was killing me!  I was so relieved by the end of this book that I&#8217;m pretty sure my blood pressure went down.

If you&#8217;re gonna have an erotica book then there should be at least two sex scenes before you hit the 50% mark, but the first real sex scene doesn&#8217;t happen till your more than half way through the story!

I get that the main story line continues on in the series and it gives you more to time to establish everything at a somewhat slower pace than each book having its storyline.

However, this was one of the most surprising and enjoyable novels I've read so far this year.The topic is fascinating. I had never heard of the orphan train, and to read about the sheer number of kids who were taken from urban centers like New York, and brought into the heartland to be adopted out to anyone needing a farm hand or help around the house - well, it was staggering. The author combined a lot of historical details with her characters so we developed not only a basic understanding of this ongoing event in history, but a great deal of empathy for the orphans who had little choice but to go.When I loved best about this book is the way the author obviously wanted us to like her main characters. It reminded me of authors like Maeve Binchy, who go out of their way to make sure the reader is actually enjoying him or herself. Many authors seem to take a perverse pleasure in giving us unlikable or difficult characters who can be hard to relate to, but from the very first pages I wanted both Molly and Vivian to become friends and to feel happy and fulfilled in their lives.Overall, I'd highly recommend this book if you're looking for something with enough depth to keep you interested, yet enough good feelings to make it an enjoyable and inspiring read.

This book really kept you guessing and really keeps you interested. I absolutely loved it!The characters, though, are what really made me love this story. I actually loved Tessa. She was still a ""lady"" but learned to trust her instincts and be brave in the face of danger and she could be just as much of a smart aleck as the boys when she wanted to be. But now to the love interests...Will and Jem...*swoon*. These boys were like light and dark, yet went so well together. Their relationship made this book really enjoyable. Will, the dark and handsome bad boy. I absolutely loved him. But you wanna know who stole the show for me? Jem. That's right, I love Jem. Jem is the real...gem of the story (corny I know, but at least you get my point).He is so amazingly sweet and kind and always knows exactly what to say to make a gal feel better. Now don't get me wrong, I love Will, with his arrogant and witty attitude, I just love Jem more. Every time he talked I just melted! And his history! OOoo I just love that boy! Honestly, he made the story for me.

The plot, characters, and setting is much more interesting and developed than the other series.When I first started Clockwork Angel, I was immediately drawn into the plot. This plot was more interesting and well thought out. Just when you think you may have figured something out, a twist in the plot happens that takes you completely by surprise. This book really kept you guessing and really keeps you interested. I absolutely loved it!The characters, though, are what really made me love this story. I actually loved Tessa. She was still a ""lady"" but learned to trust her instincts and be brave in the face of danger and she could be just as much of a smart aleck as the boys when she wanted to be. But now to the love interests...Will and Jem...*swoon*. These boys were like light and dark, yet went so well together. Their relationship made this book really enjoyable. Will, the dark and handsome bad boy. I absolutely loved him. But you wanna know who stole the show for me? Jem. That's right, I love Jem. Jem is the real...gem of the story (corny I know, but at least you get my point).He is so amazingly sweet and kind and always knows exactly what to say to make a gal feel better. Now don't get me wrong, I love Will, with his arrogant and witty attitude, I just love Jem more. Every time he talked I just melted! And his history! OOoo I just love that boy! Honestly, he made the story for me.

Unable to bear the bitchiness of the other young women of Jackson, she determines to go to New York to persue a writing career. Advised by an editor to write about things that ""disturb"" her, Skeeter makes friends with Aibileen, and through her, Minny, and begins the writing of the book that will change all of their lives.Aibileen has been a black maid in Jackson for many years, raising 17 white children, yet unable to even use the same bathroom as her white employers. She has experienced many injustices and indignities in her life. She has also known tragedy. Her son, Treelore, was 24 when he died in a work related accident. While loading timbers onto the loading dock at the mill where he worked, he slipped off the dock, falling onto the asphalt. A man driving the tractor to the dock rolled right over him, crushing him to death, while his boss and fellow workers stood by and did nothing.

She can cook like no one else, but she is the sassiest maid in Mississippi, and has a real problem saying nothing when she is insulted and abused by the white women she works for.  At her last job, after suffering numerous insults and charges of stealing, Minny has taken revenge on the daughter, the Terrible Awful Thing, that she tries to keep secret and that has gotten her fired for the umpteenth time. Now she works for a woman so new in the town that she is ignored by the long time residents and doesn't know about Minny's  ""secret.""Seemingly as different as can be, and kept apart by the cultural and social boundaries of the town, these three women will come together in secret to create a book that will destroy their lives as they currently exist, and yet will also empower each of them to break the boundaries, give them pride in themselves, and the hope and courage to pursue their dreams.These characters are so real, their voices so vivid, that they make you feel as if you know them, and can laugh and cry with them. Their life experiences are, by turns, touching, heart-wrenching, and historically accurate. These three strong, courageous, and hopeful women make this a book that you cannot put down and do not want to see end. I  truly loved this book, and highly recommend it.

Being a NaNoWriMo writer myself, I was heartened to learn that someone had not only published a book produced during the event, but said book had been successful enough to warrant bestseller status and a movie deal.  So I decided to check it out for myself, and see what a fellow NaNoWriMo writer had turned out.In the end, I found myself torn over the book -- I love it to pieces, but at the same time it frustrates me, though not enough to make me want to give it a negative review.The titular ""Night Circus"" is actually called Cirque de Reves (Circus of Dreams), a uniquely built circus open only at night and with attractions and acts that straddle the line between fantasy and reality, between the fantastic and the outright impossible.  Behind said circus are two magicians -- Marco, assistant to the circus' proprietor and the secret power behind maintaining and organizing said circus, and Celia, daughter of a famous stage magician and serving as the circus' illusionist.  Both are bound to the circus and are pitted against one another in a mysterious contest by their enigmatic instructors... but both end up falling in love, and seek to defy the rules of the game with potentially disastrous consequences for the rest of the circus.  Meanwhile, a farm boy named Bailey becomes entranced with the circus in general -- and with Poppet, the clairvoyant daughter of the big cat trainers, in particular -- and finds his own fate becoming entwined with that of the circus.Let me begin with the one thing about this book that frustrates me -- the main characters, Marco and Celia.  They are some of the flattest, blandest, most cardboard characters I have ever come across in a work of fiction, second only to Bella from the ""Twilight"" series.  They aren't annoying or pathetic characters, but they are so devoid of personality that it becomes difficult to care about them.  Most of the other characters, even the minor ones, have at least some personality to them, and I found myself more concerned with their fates than with the lovers/competitors who were the story's spotlight.  In particular, I loved Bailey, Poppet, and Poppet's twin brother Widget, and dearly wish they had been the focus of the story instead of Marco and Celia.  I was always heartened to see another Bailey chapter in the book as I read, while the Celia and Marco chapters didn't hold my interest as well, as the characters were too lifeless for me to be emotionally invested in them.That's my only quibble with this book, however -- the rest is one of the most enthralling and beautiful fictional worlds I have ever come across in a work of fiction.The circus is so grandly described, so beautifully built through Morgenstern's wordcraft, that I find myself wishing it existed in real life so I could pay a visit.  She describes not only the sights of the circus, but the evocative smells -- as one character in the book states, the sense of smell is an under-utilized but powerful sense.  And she makes it all seem entirely plausible and real, to the point where I find myself wanting to visit the Paper Menagerie, attend a Midnight Dinner, purchase a chocolate bat and a cocoa and go watch the illusionist or the contortionist at work, or even simply light a candle on the Wishing Tree.Of all the characters in the book, I think my favorite, besides Bailey and the twins, would be Friedrick, a clockmaker who becomes enamored with the circus to the point that he builds what can only be called a fandom around it (much like Trekkies are to Star Trek).  The collective friendship and brotherhood among these reveurs, as they call themselves, reminds me of the same friendship and brotherhood that exists among fellow fans of some of my own geeky interests, and so helped me identify even more with the titular circus.All in all, I love this book so much that I can't give it a negative review -- it's marvelously written and builds a beautiful world that sucks the reader in and makes them never want to leave.  But sadly, the main characters are so flatly written, so bland and uninteresting, that I can't give this five stars.  I do not regret reading this book, though, and despite the unengaging leads I will happily recommend it to those who like light fantasy and marvelous worldbuilding.

So I decided to check it out for myself, and see what a fellow NaNoWriMo writer had turned out.In the end, I found myself torn over the book -- I love it to pieces, but at the same time it frustrates me, though not enough to make me want to give it a negative review.The titular ""Night Circus"" is actually called Cirque de Reves (Circus of Dreams), a uniquely built circus open only at night and with attractions and acts that straddle the line between fantasy and reality, between the fantastic and the outright impossible.  Behind said circus are two magicians -- Marco, assistant to the circus' proprietor and the secret power behind maintaining and organizing said circus, and Celia, daughter of a famous stage magician and serving as the circus' illusionist.  Both are bound to the circus and are pitted against one another in a mysterious contest by their enigmatic instructors... but both end up falling in love, and seek to defy the rules of the game with potentially disastrous consequences for the rest of the circus.  Meanwhile, a farm boy named Bailey becomes entranced with the circus in general -- and with Poppet, the clairvoyant daughter of the big cat trainers, in particular -- and finds his own fate becoming entwined with that of the circus.Let me begin with the one thing about this book that frustrates me -- the main characters, Marco and Celia.  They are some of the flattest, blandest, most cardboard characters I have ever come across in a work of fiction, second only to Bella from the ""Twilight"" series.  They aren't annoying or pathetic characters, but they are so devoid of personality that it becomes difficult to care about them.  Most of the other characters, even the minor ones, have at least some personality to them, and I found myself more concerned with their fates than with the lovers/competitors who were the story's spotlight.  In particular, I loved Bailey, Poppet, and Poppet's twin brother Widget, and dearly wish they had been the focus of the story instead of Marco and Celia.  I was always heartened to see another Bailey chapter in the book as I read, while the Celia and Marco chapters didn't hold my interest as well, as the characters were too lifeless for me to be emotionally invested in them.That's my only quibble with this book, however -- the rest is one of the most enthralling and beautiful fictional worlds I have ever come across in a work of fiction.The circus is so grandly described, so beautifully built through Morgenstern's wordcraft, that I find myself wishing it existed in real life so I could pay a visit.  She describes not only the sights of the circus, but the evocative smells -- as one character in the book states, the sense of smell is an under-utilized but powerful sense.  And she makes it all seem entirely plausible and real, to the point where I find myself wanting to visit the Paper Menagerie, attend a Midnight Dinner, purchase a chocolate bat and a cocoa and go watch the illusionist or the contortionist at work, or even simply light a candle on the Wishing Tree.Of all the characters in the book, I think my favorite, besides Bailey and the twins, would be Friedrick, a clockmaker who becomes enamored with the circus to the point that he builds what can only be called a fandom around it (much like Trekkies are to Star Trek).  The collective friendship and brotherhood among these reveurs, as they call themselves, reminds me of the same friendship and brotherhood that exists among fellow fans of some of my own geeky interests, and so helped me identify even more with the titular circus.All in all, I love this book so much that I can't give it a negative review -- it's marvelously written and builds a beautiful world that sucks the reader in and makes them never want to leave.  But sadly, the main characters are so flatly written, so bland and uninteresting, that I can't give this five stars.  I do not regret reading this book, though, and despite the unengaging leads I will happily recommend it to those who like light fantasy and marvelous worldbuilding.

It wouldn't be too difficult, what with Sunday School teachings, parents reading bible stories to them, and the pretty pictures and paintings that adorn the walls of every church and Sunday school hall.I don't think I'm trying to say Colton made everything up completely from scratch; I believe he did have some form of NDE, and maybe he really did see his Father praying to God when he felt so desperate and angry. What gets me is all the stuff that comes later.Kids have an imagination. Kids make things up-they don't necessarily consider it a bad thing, it just happens. Particularly when they discover that other people are expecting them to have answers. The majority of the time, Colton doesn't volunteer any information, which to me is pretty odd. I've babysat 3 to 6 year old kids and my own nephew isn't even two-but he babbles and talks constantly. So did the others. They told me all about their day without me asking and went into every detail they could remember. I also recall doing this myself; when I was excited by some new experience I went straight to my parents and talked-talked-talked. Colton, on the other hand, usually gives information only when it's asked for. This gives me the feeling that he's trying to come up with an answer on the spot based on knowledge or experience taught to him.I read another review on here where a reader pointed out that Colton enjoys play-battles and that he probably got the idea of his father ""going into a war"" from them. I gotta admit it's a good point. I was struck by the same thought in the scene where Colton's father jokes about they're not being any swords in Heaven, to which Colton seems to hitch himself up and say, almost indignantly, ""Oh Yes they DO have swords in Heaven!"" And sometime later he comments that a war will take place where people will fight with either swords or arrows. Kinda low tech for the human race, isn't it? But to me it wasn't unexpected, considering all this war business was brought up after he watched the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe movie. (BTW-I thought the author went into unnecessary detail about the Narnia plot. Who doesn't know about it, really? Looked like he was just trying to up the word count.)One of the more peculiar instances I found in the book was where Colton's father and wife look outside to see an astonishingly vivid and beautiful rainbow. They go outside to have a look, then summon Colton over, thinking he would enjoy it. But the kid comes out just long enough to say ""Oh yeah, I know, I asked God to send one,"" before he leaves to play. So...he prayed to God to send him a lovely rainbow, but spends all of what, 5 seconds, looking at it? He's not in the least surprised it's there, because apparently he knew it would come, but the book doesn't mention anything about him looking out for the rainbow beforehand, and he didn't seem all that impressed by it anyway. Either the kid's getting spoiled by all the ""signs"" God's sending him for his enjoyment, or maybe, just maybe, he's taken the chance to reinforce the idea into our heads that he's ""Been there, seen that,"" and has that special connection with our heavenly father.Again, I'm not suggesting Colton is deliberately lying or making things up because he's some devious little punk that wants to make fools of us all for buying into his stories. But I DO think a good chunk of it is indeed fabricated, that he's only relying on the truths taught to him by his Christian family to help support his and his family's particular beliefs. Like I said, I am a Christian and I certainly do believe there's a Heaven and God and Jesus and all that, but I can't take this book as credible evidence.To be fair, I've never died or had a NDE or an Out Of Body experience. I'm in no position whatsoever to say with 100% accuracy what is or is not on the other side. For all I know, it could very well be exactly as the Bible tells us-or it couldn't. I wouldn't know.All that's left to say is that, if there was just ONE thing about this book that may have gotten me a little miffed, it's this: I had to pay 6 bucks for this. This story has a VERY simplistic writing style, and it's short. I have nothing against simple and sweet, I even have a few others of that sort in my kindle library, but then, they were either freebies or 1-3 bucks. This was a little over 6. It really, truly wasn't worth the buy, at least not to me. I'm not angry I read the story, just that it should cost so much for so little.

In this case, the author in question, Juliet, living in 1946-London receives a query from a complete stranger living on the isle of Guernsey, a little bit of England off the coast of France, one of what are known as the Channel Isles.  Unable to expend the resources to protect it, the UK allowed Germany to overrun Guernsey during the war, and its inhabitants lived under Nazi Occupation for five years.  The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is formed as a spur-of-the-moment ruse to cover illicit activities from the Nazis but ultimately grows into a group of people who use literature and camaraderie to help one another get through the hardships and heartbreak of the war.  This book is about how Juliet comes to know and love what once were complete strangers and how they change her life forever, as she does for them.A cast of enchanting characters populate Guernsey:  a quiet stone mason/pig farmer, quite common but the backbone of the group; a senior lady who mothers everyone and lends the disparate group an air of respectability; an aging fisherman who is forced to send his grandson to England to escape the Occupation, then loses his daughter and her newborn on the day the Germans roll in; an eccentric free spirit rumored to be a witch who sells her herbal concoctions in a market stall; a drunken valet impersonating his absent lord of an employer and draining his wine cellar; an orphaned love child in desperate need of a mother; a holier-than-thou busybody who condemns everyone and everything; a courageous young woman, the heart of group, who binds them all together with love and self-sacrifice.  Juliet is courted by a rich, pushy American, is doted on by her editor, supported by her girlhood friend, and embraced by the good people of Guernsey.I find ""correspondence"" novels somewhat gimmicky and often strained, especially because letters between friends tend to rely a great deal upon previous mutual understanding which doesn't translate well into storytelling.  Either the reader is forced to accept that the correspondents write tomes filled with unnecessary (to the recipient) minutiae with each and every letter they send, or the details feel too sketchy, unsatisfying, or even confusing to the reader.  However, Mdms. Shaffers and Barrows weave an engrossing, heart-warming, and sometimes tear-jerking tale with just the right balance between plausibility and necessary narrative.  The voices of each character are distinctive, humorous, and natural.  The tone is light and generous, albeit sad at times.  This is, after all, a story about the privations of war, starvation, oppression, betrayal, and brutality, but also about hope and courage and love and sacrifice.The book ends with joy and victory.  True, the war is over, but life is still difficult.  Shortages abound and the healing is slow.  Europe still reels in the aftershocks of pandemic destruction.  But, the new day is dawning, Guernsey is picking itself up and dusting itself off, setting about the work of rebuilding, as is London and the rest of the UK.  Hope gleams brightly and love, if not able to conquer all, overcomes a great deal.  It inspires hope and infuses fresh courage and determination in our friends.

There are some quotes from the book and some bad words for all you youngins:The book follows Brooke who goes to an Underground Boxing Ring with her friend and finds herself completely infatuated with Remington ""Riptide"" Tate (Remy).  In her words he's mesmerizingly perfect. :)  And trust me, the way he's described in the book, um yeah I would say so.If you love your cocky, alpha male, bad boy, sexy as hell, fighter, then you are definitely going to love Remy.They have an instant connection and an intense first meeting to say the least, in front of everyone that is there to see the fight.Brooke has gone through some things in her past, being a former athlete, now into sports rehab.  She is in between jobs and trying to find her place in a life that didn't turn out the way she dreamed.After their first encounter shes contacted by Remy's team and asked to come on the road with him to be his physical therapist.  She's hesitant but Remy doesn't really give her time to think about it (hence the Alpha Male reference).You know they feel something for each other but their relationship starts off as just friendl and she works for him, but quickly feelings start to develop and get stronger.  They share intimate moments, especially when it comes to sharing music with each other (it plays a big part for Remy, you'll find out why when you read) and Brooke is ready to throw herself at him, but he has some deeper, darker issues he needs to work through.The connection between Brooke and Remy is really just intense.  The first half of the book I was like OMFG please just do it already.  I was dying. The sexual tension between them is ridiculous.  I will tell you there was no actual sex for about the first half of the book, but I was totally hot and bothered anyway.  No sex required.And let me just tell you, the discipline that Remy has, freaking crazy!  Especially when you discover some of the deeper issues he keeps hidden.  I mean holy crap!!!And Brooke, I really loved her, but come on girl, with all the ""stretching"" and ""therapy"" she had to do for him,  I would have had him flat on his back, clothes ripped of and been all over that!  She was the definition of sexually frustrated if you ask me.  But that's what happens when eventually all you're getting are insanely erotic kisses from Remy.The more you learn about Remy in the book, you fall deeper in love with him.  At times my heart ached for him.  The moments he was able to express himself I could just see how much he cared for Brooke and how he struggled with it.I don't want to give too much more away because you really, really need to read the book for yourself.  But I absolutely loved it.  I loved the authors writing style, how she pulled you in.  I got involved with the story, so into it that I read it all in one sitting.  It started off with the intense meeting and didn't let up.  I really enjoyed it.I will tell you all, there is a HEA.  There are some twists and turns along the way, outside sources causing problems, and Brooke also having a bit of an inner battle, and a big ole' case of miscommunication, but it definitely is a good ending.And you also get a tiny sneak of Remy as the Epilogue is from his POV.I definitely recommend!!

Every year the Capitol forces one girl and one boy from each district into a giant arena where they fight to the death, on TV, simply to remind everyone that the Capitol is in charge. The last one standing gets fame and fortune.Sixteen year old Katniss Everdeen is selected to be one of the victims from District 12. Her hunting skills and knowledge of the forest are helpful, but to win the support of the audience she must pretend to fall in love with her District 12 male counterpart, Peeta.It becomes one of the most confusing love stories I have ever read.The story itself is fine, insofar as a story about children murdering each other can be fine. There is plenty of suspense, action, outwitting of enemies, survival, explosions, and occasional humor. The setting is descriptive and the characters are well rounded. But throughout the whole book you have to also deal with a semi-fake-romance between Katniss and Peeta.The book is written in first-person from Katniss' point of view. From the very beginning, we are told that she only puts up with the romance to get support from the rich audience, who in turn might send down helpful gifts or tools into the arena to help them survive. Unfortunately she also knows that Peeta really does like her, and so you end up with a convoluted love triangle of which one point is the entire population of the city.It's one of those situations where the reader understands and predicts things much, much faster than the characters do. Katniss describes Peeta as a nice, generous, strong, giving, attractive person, and then spends the majority of the book annoyed that she has to pretend to be in love with him. Much of my reading was spent waiting for the eventual ""Katniss eventually falls in love with Peeta"" chapter.It would be like Sherlock Holmes identifying the culprit as a large, balding man with a walrus mustache and then spending the majority of the book obliviously buying pastries from the large, balding, mustache-d baker. We are never given a reason why Katniss does not actually like Peeta, other than a weak ""there's another boy back home who I am also indifferent towards"" excuse.I really want to like the Hunger Games. The story and setting are unique and interesting, and set up nicely for more in the same world. But the awkward love triangle, where Peeta loves Katniss, Katniss wants to please the audience and so pretends to love Peeta, and the audience wants to watch them die for sadistic entertainment, just makes no sense. It would be better if we were given a reason why Katniss doesn't like Peeta in return, but we never do.And for someone named Peeta, we sure do see him eat a lot of animals.

Simply written, action-packed and fast-paced, it's hard to put down. I just wish it was longer.The storyline is generally chronological and easy to follow, as Kyle talks about his time as a Navy Seal and sniper in the Middle East in a post-9/11 wartime environment. The chapters are separated into significant blocks of time, like deployments, and Kyle basically fills the pages taking about significant events or stories from those time periods. Each of these stories range in legth from a paragraph to a couple pages. Kyle mostly details the various patrols, battles, firefights and sniper missions that made up his deployments, with very little political talk or spin, which i liked. The only non-SEAL content of the book is the first part, which talks about his background and childhood, leading up to him entering the Navy, which is helpful in seeing what drives him and what may have helped him in training or his deployments.Aside from his missions, Kyle talks about his joint operations/patrols with the Army and Marine Corps, some of his SEAL teammates, sniper training, equipment and psychological aspects of war and killing insurgents. There is enough detail in the book to make it very interesting.I also liked that Kyle seemed like a down to earth guy for the most part, and you weren't overwhelmed by egotistical rants about how great SEALs are, like in some books. (If you know enough about them and understand their role and what they've accomplished over the years, its not hard to already have great respect for them, you dont need it pushed in your face, as it can take away from the stories)There isnt much discussion about BUD/S training, but for those that have read even a few SEAL books, you'll already have seen that information.

If you're looking for post-BUD/S training info, tryThe Finishing School: Earning the Navy SEAL Trident. I found the lack of BUD/S talk one of the positive things about this book, as nearly every SEAL book seems to have at least 25% devoted to BUD/S, so it gets old and redundant after a while. However, the author does talk about post BUD/s and pre-deloyment related training, which is interesting.He also doesn't get too much in the weeds on command structure or military procedures and processes.

This wasn't that. I found the first chapter kind of boring and the first third plodding. Then I hit page 219. This book's pace feels a little like the first hill of a roller coaster ride. It chugs up the hill and you wonder what all the hype is about, then at p. 219 it starts a free fall down the hill gaining momentum until the end. I read the first 219 pages in a week and the last 370 pages in two days.Plot summary:Reporter Blomkvist is hired by rich patriarch Vanger to examine the cold case of how his niece Harriet disappeared 40 years ago. In their research Blomkvist and his unorthodox assistant Salander uncover gruesome family secrets.My opinion:Holy cow is this good. The story is complex, rich, and in-depth. Most of the details you think are just color are actually significant so pay attention. Larsson may have written one of the most fascinating characters in fiction in Lisbeth Salander the goth, brainiac hacker. Blomkvist is an odd hero; he's ethical as a journalist though morally suspect in a Bohemian kind of way that is a lot more forgiving in a 25 year-old than in a 45 year-old. The characters may not be likeable to some, but they are complete, well-rounded, fascinating and complex. The plot is compelling if gruesome and disturbing at several points. Be warned.There were some writing style things that bugged me personally: A lot of the scenes start in one POV and end in someone else's POV (the pivotal office scene on p. 220 is an example). The names can get very confusing. Where most authors try to avoid even using the same letter in naming their characters, Larsson uses names like Henrik, Harriett, and Harold living on Hedeby Island off Hedestad. He'll refer to a character by three names such as: Berger, Erika and Ricky, but despite some of these minor annoyances, the story and characters are excellent.This book is compelling, fascinating, unique, unpredictable and not to be missed. It's complex and adult -- and definitely not for the under 21s in my opinion.

This wasn't that. I found the first chapter kind of boring and the first third plodding. Then I hit page 219. This book's pace feels a little like the first hill of a roller coaster ride. It chugs up the hill and you wonder what all the hype is about, then at p. 219 it starts a free fall down the hill gaining momentum until the end. I read the first 219 pages in a week and the last 370 pages in two days.Plot summary:Reporter Blomkvist is hired by rich patriarch Vanger to examine the cold case of how his niece Harriet disappeared 40 years ago. In their research Blomkvist and his unorthodox assistant Salander uncover gruesome family secrets.My opinion:Holy cow is this good. The story is complex, rich, and in-depth. Most of the details you think are just color are actually significant so pay attention. Larsson may have written one of the most fascinating characters in fiction in Lisbeth Salander the goth, brainiac hacker.

Sky has also never gone to public school (or any school) before, but she's enrolling for her Senior year in order to list some extracurricular activities on her college applications. Upon attending school, she signs up for none, unless you count being stalked by Dean Holder as an extracurricular activity. At nearly 18 years old, Holder is the first guy Sky has EVER been attracted to, despite making out with many. Too bad that he makes her feel uncomfortable because he's a stalker and all. At least for two days. Then things get crazy.The first 60ish% of Hopeless is 1&#9733; material. I hated absolutely everything about it. The first thing Sky tells us is that she's not a slut unless being slutty means making out with lots of guys. Um, well, that's not what being a slut means, so no you're not a slut. I actually think it's great that she's comfortable enough to do what she wants with guys and stop them when it starts crossing into territory she doesn't want to go. What I'm not okay with is all of the &#34;slut this&#34; and &#34;whore that&#34; and &#34;I don't have sex so I'm not a slut&#34; and blah, blah, blah! This all spans several chapters. Sky really wants us to know she is not a slut, since she's never even been attracted to a boy before, and only makes out because it lets her shut her brain off and not feel anything. Of course, on her first day of school she's already the school slut, but she holds her head high. Wonderful.Then she meets the one boy who gives her butterflies and makes her want to do naughty, naughty, dirty things. Meet Holder! He follows Sky to her car after glaring at her, demands to know her name, snatches her ID, and clearly has anger problems. Sky thinks he's sexy as hell, but she's also nervous because of his &#34;intense&#34; behavior. Holder proceeds to stalk her for the next two days, and actually gets pissed off when she points out that she doesn't know him, because ya know...she doesn't. Then later on, he gets pissed off again about a bracelet she's wearing, grabs her, yells at her, then disappears for a whole month. Sky's reaction? She wants an apology so she can give him a second chance. By the way, she thought he was just on drugs. How about NO!Does Holder apologize? Nope. He climbs through her window in the middle of the night, climbs into bed with her, and they start making out. I don't know about you, but I'd scream my head off if someone just appeared in my bed with their lips all over me! Then he cooks her breakfast, because nothing says I'm sorry like fresh bacon. He gives this epic speech about how he won't apologize because he doesn't want forgiveness. I don't really think it's up to him whether or not Sky forgives him (which she does), but let's just play along. Now they're in &#34;live.&#34; That's somewhere between like and love, if you were wondering.Let's talk about Holder a bit more. Clearly he's unstable. He literally stalks Sky and shows abusive tendencies. Sky even points out all of the red flags, but she clearly doesn't care, because...he has a tragic past that totally explains his behavior! Okay, so, his story does make it clear why he is the way he is, but it in no way excuses his actions. He admits to nearly beating a kid to death like it's no big deal. Aside from grabbing Sky's arm over the bracelet, later when all of the craziness of Hopeless comes out, he shoves her aside hard enough that she falls! I understand why he did it, but again, not an excuse! I can't say why because it's a huge spoiler. Anyone who is capable of this is not boyfriend material! Does Sky think any of this is wrong? Nope, they just have lots of sex to forget about it!Now, I did really like the plot once it showed up. However, it had already been tainted by everything I already mentioned. Hopeless really felt like two distinct books, and it's certainly long enough that it could have been. That first 60% is all about this unhealthy relationship and there are some hints about what's to come. The last 40% was actually quite good. I flew through it because I had to know what the heck was going on. I did figure out the situation with Sky's father as soon as he was mentioned, so it was just a matter of waiting another 300 pages for everyone else to realize it to. This made it not as shocking when it came out, which is unfortunate, because this could have been really emotional.While I liked the last part of Hopeless a lot, it did feel like the author had a checklist of issues and included all of them. There's adoption, sexuality, suicide, grief, repressed memories, child abuse, incest, kidnapping, mistaken identities, and probably some others that I'm forgetting. There's even a token gay friend. I actually did like Breckin, but I was annoyed that he was only the token gay friend. Once the plot appeared, it was twist after twist after twist. When you thought the worst has appeared, more comes!Hopeless is...I don't even know. The relationship between Sky and Holder was the biggest downfall. I think all of the intense plot twists were suppose to distract us from his previous actions, and probably excuse it, but it doesn't. This is not a healthy relationship. He has issues that he needs to get under control before he seriously hurts someone else. Sky has her own issues so that she apparently looks past his abuse, since she needs him to heal her, because sex heals all! And is this being pushed as New Adult? It's not. It is literally sexed up YA. The characters are 17 and in high school. There's just a lot of sex and violence, making it mature YA not NA. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(5727, 5741)",1,0.0,False

And like all curious minds, I caved figuring it had to be at least halfway good considering all the mad crazy eyed people singing its praise.  Unfortunately, about midway into the book I kept questioning if I was reading the same thing.  From all the craze, I expected great writing, engaging characters, an interesting plot, and namely all the ingredients for a good novel. What I received in reality was a subpar erotic romance with one dimensional characters, and an iffy plot.Fifty Shades of Grey starts with the main character, Anastasia, or Ana as she likes to be called, who is on the cusp of graduating college.  She's a clumsy, nave, young female, who never wears makeup, tries to hide in a crowd, and doesn't see her own beauty.  And, because she is so utterly sweet, is cajoled into interviewing Christian Grey, a mega rich, surprisingly young man with a million dollar company, for her best friend's school paper.  From that moment forward, it seems Christian just can't keep his eyes off little Miss Ana, and manipulates a few non-chanced meetings. Things seem to get hot and heavy between them, but Christian tends to frighten Ana, especially with his needs and intense nature.  As an adopted orphan, he went through his own living hell, and has the emotional and physical issues to prove it. But Ana is slowly losing her heart to him, and can only hope that she has the stamina and strength needed to not only help Christian, but to see if he can learn to care for her as well.**Slight Spoilers**With the synopsis, such as it is, out of the way, let me start by saying I still don't understand the hype.  If people are reading this for the erotica alone, then I pity them as there are tons of authors who actually know how to write to keep a reader engaged, and the love scenes are way hotter.  If you don't believe me, just check Amazons kindle section in fiction. They have enough variations in erotica for all kinks of life.  Now if you are going into this for the romance/plot...I still hold by my ""there are way better authors out there"" mentality. The plot isn't new or unique by any standard, and the writing was subpar at best.  It all boils down to Christian having major issues from being abused as a child, and because of this he uses BDSM as a form of management for his internal struggle.  It's like he has to have control over everything as an adult as he couldn't control anything as a child.  (think Sleeping with the Enemy without the husband being totally psychotic)  Ana is totally innocent in all things sexual, and Christians kink causes such a big shock that she doesn't know whether she likes it or not.  So nearly the whole book is a revolving ""yes, no, yes, no"" with her.  And speaking of the characters: I found that Christian had more personality than Ana, and that's saying something as this is told in first person from Ana's point of view.  Christian is definitely an alpha male (which I do love alpha males), but his personal demons cause him to be slightly cruel in my opinion. Ana is a complete spindly individual who was written so nave that it held me in shock.  She doesn't understand some of the innuendo or ""devices"" Christian wants to use that even if you aren't in the world of BDSM you've at least heard of.  If I could, I would give this book two and a half stars, as it wasn't horrible, but it could've been written a lot better.  It did cause me to want to know what happens at the end, so I'll give it that, but all in all Fifty Shades of Grey just didn't do it for me, and I feel slightly duped for giving in to my curiosity.

The characters are what really makes this book stand out. While the overall plot is fascinating, if the characters didn't come alive to me then the book would have been meh to me. As it stands however, DeStefano makes Rhine, Gabriel, Jenna, Cecily and Linden all become real to me.Rhine's character is very conflicted throughout the book yet she is a likable character. I don't know what I would have done in her situation. I can't even fathom knowing that I would be dead in a few years. What makes her different from the other wives is that she knows what the real world is like and she knows what having a real family is like. Therefore unlike everyone else, she has hope and she is doing all she can to live for that hope.Jenna's character is devastatingly tragic for me. I really wish we could have known more about her. When we're introduced to her, it's almost like she's already doomed from the start. She's quietest of the three wives and the one that keeps to herself the most. She loves reading which made me relate to her the most. Since she pretty much knows her fate already, she just takes each day one at a time. Also as the oldest, she seems to be the wisest of the group. This is drastically different from Cecily, who at the youngest, seems to be the most flighty and immature. Yet it is her who has the biggest influence on Linden's father due to her circumstances. It's quite sad to read about what she has to go through afterward and how she is kept from what she loves most. The thing that got me is that Linden is not a bad guy. I was so ready for him to be like his father and for me to hate him, but he wasn't and I didn't. I felt immensely sorry for him throughout most of the book. His father on the other hand, oooh it's almost like reading about Umbridge all over again. Still when you know WHY he's doing it, it makes sense though his obsession with finding a cure makes his character seem unloving towards his current son.Overall, Wither is an absolutely fascinating read. The world that DeStefano has created seems to be a bleak and hopeless world for the young. However for characters such as Rhine and Gabriel, there is resistance and a fighting chance for survival. I cannot wait for the next book in the series though since this is a trilogy, I bet the 2nd book will have an even worse cliffhanger. Even if you don't like other dystopia book, I really think you should try this one. It's an engrossing read and will keep you glued to your seat as you frantically turn pages. HIGHLY recommended.

Clearly, the guy has got something going for him. And whatever else you might say about The Da Vinci Code and its successors in the Robert Langdon series, lots of people read them.Far be it from me to advance some psychosexual explanation for this surprising phenomenon. The numbers don't lie. I can only wonder why.OK, admittedly, I've read all those Dan Brown novels. Yes, I admit it. And I even found the suspense in the first couple of them to be compelling. Brown's early novels -- Digital Fortress and Deception Point -- were fascinating to me. And I couldn't wait to get to the end of The Da Vinci Code because the historical mystery was brilliant and the suspense was excruciating.Inferno, not so much. Although there were many surprises in store for me in the book's final chapters, I'd already figured out some of the fast ones Brown was going to pull as he thundered toward the climax. Because, often enough, it's possible to foresee the plotline based not on what an author writes as on what he doesn't write. That sometimes smacks of manipulation, which invariably makes me uncomfortable.Now, just in case you want to know what Inferno is about, listen up: Robert Langdon finds himself in a hospital bed in Florence with a raging headache and a case of short-term amnesia. He can't remember a thing about the past three days, and he doesn't have a clue why the back of his head is bandaged or how or why he got to Florence.

Clearly, the guy has got something going for him. And whatever else you might say about The Da Vinci Code and its successors in the Robert Langdon series, lots of people read them.Far be it from me to advance some psychosexual explanation for this surprising phenomenon. The numbers don't lie. I can only wonder why.OK, admittedly, I've read all those Dan Brown novels. Yes, I admit it. And I even found the suspense in the first couple of them to be compelling. Brown's early novels -- Digital Fortress and Deception Point -- were fascinating to me. And I couldn't wait to get to the end of The Da Vinci Code because the historical mystery was brilliant and the suspense was excruciating.Inferno, not so much. Although there were many surprises in store for me in the book's final chapters, I'd already figured out some of the fast ones Brown was going to pull as he thundered toward the climax. Because, often enough, it's possible to foresee the plotline based not on what an author writes as on what he doesn't write. That sometimes smacks of manipulation, which invariably makes me uncomfortable.Now, just in case you want to know what Inferno is about, listen up: Robert Langdon finds himself in a hospital bed in Florence with a raging headache and a case of short-term amnesia. He can't remember a thing about the past three days, and he doesn't have a clue why the back of his head is bandaged or how or why he got to Florence. Sienna Brooks, his physician -- a lovely young blonde woman, of course! Hollywood must be appeased -- tells him he's been shot in the head. Meanwhile, we are introduced to a shadowy character who runs a mysterious and powerful global organization from his headquarters on a massive converted yacht anchored somewhere in the Adriatic. He appears to be mixed up in Langdon's misadventure in some way, but it's clear we won't figure out how until we've read further in the book.

You see, I get lovingly &#8216;bullied&#8217; into reading books a lot. For some reason, those books seem to be the ones that I pick up last. I have no reason and definitely no excuse. That just seems to be the way things go. In the case of Darkhouse it&#8217;s even worse, I&#8217;ve had a couple people recommend it. I even had one of my blogging buddies offer to buy me the entire series if I would just pick this book up and read it. That was a pretty reasonable, no strings attached request considering it was already on my kindle (and has been for over a YEAR.) Not to mention the fact that it was FREE. *hangs head in shame* Now that I&#8217;ve gotten that off my chest, I can move on with the review.Darkhouse wasn&#8217;t at all what I expected. From the moment I &#8216;met&#8217; Perry I was hooked. All good characters have flaws. If they were perfect the average reader wouldn&#8217;t be able to relate to them. For me, Perry was much more than relatable, she was real. I loved her. I loved her &#8216;voice,&#8217; I loved her personality and I loved her spunk. She was lacking in self confidence and she didn&#8217;t have a lot of support (even from the people who loved her) but there was just something about her that made me like her. I just knew that once she found her niche things would turn around for her.Then there was Dex. I&#8217;m still not quite sure about how I feel about him, but to be fair, neither was Perry by the end of the book. Coming into the Experiment in Terror series late, I know that there is a lot more to come and to be honest, he kind of grew on me. There&#8217;s a lot to be learned about Dex and I&#8217;m willing to be things get a whole lot more interesting.As far as the story goes&#8230; yeah, it was just scary enough to keep the pages turning. Karina Halle definitely kept me on the edge of my seat. I&#8217;m not sure if I would have gone to the lighthouse the first time much less the times that Perry and Dex returned, but if they hadn&#8217;t, there wouldn&#8217;t have been a story, so who am I to argue. (I&#8217;m also a confirmed chicken and not afraid to admit it.  )The characters were great, especially Dex and Perry. Out of all of Perry&#8217;s family members, Ada and her uncle Al were the ones that I liked the most. Her parents irritated me, for a lot of reasons. You&#8217;ll have to read the book to understand why, but if you still don&#8217;t know exactly why, feel free to ask. Some of it is because of not wanting to give anything away and a lot of it is because I didn&#8217;t like the way Perry was treated. Something tells me that Perry and Dex are going to be good for each other in more ways than one.So yeah, I definitely enjoyed Darkhouse and could kick myself for waiting so long to finally pick it up.

This is hand-down the most beautiful cover I have ever seen before (and I have seen some pretty beautiful covers before like ""Fallen"" and ""Torment"" by Lauren Kate, ""Halo"", and whatnot). When I originally bought the book I thought that if the book wasn't that great, I would be okay with that, just because the cover is so beautiful... (which thankfully I didn't have to worry about).Anyways, on to the story. This book is very much the case of girl and boy meet, as they look at one another/ touch one another they fall madly and deeply in love (all within an hour of knowing one another). I hate when this happens in books, mainly because it is not realistic whatsoever, and I personally believe that the stuff that happens as two people fall in love is extremely interesting. However, I didn't fully hate that this happened in this book. I mean, it did bug me, but it didn't completely turn me off of the book (*cough, cough, ""Halo"" by Alexandra Adornetto)... I think that what made up for this occurring was the boys....Oh, the boys... It's weird, lately while reading books where the female character has to choose between two boys, I haven't been able to choose which boy I prefer, or if I do choose between the two boys, I only like one over the other by a fraction (ie. Gale and Peeta in ""The Hunger Games"" trilogy) and in the first half of the novel, I, for the life of me, could not choose between Ren and Shay. I also found it weird that I liked Ren in this book. Usually I am anti-player boy, but with Ren, I was almost able to overlook the fact that he was a player, mainly due to the fact that he clearly cared about Calla and when he was a sweet, he was a really sweet (ie. giving her the ring). On the other hand, well, Shay was the perfect snarky/ sarcastic boy who also clearly cared about Calla. So how is a girl to choose? I did end up picking my favourite between the boys about halfway through the novel, but I still felt really bad for the boy that I didn't choose (the one who Calla didn't end up with in the end) and I think that because of his sacrifice at the end of the novel he still might have a chance with her.While reading this book I found myself growing more and more frustrated with Calla. I felt like she was playing both boys way too much in this book. I understand that she was confused and everything, but there was another option available, she could have isolated herself from both in order to think over the decision carefully without having any outside influences impacting her decision (as opposed to making out with both of them, making them both think that he was the one she was obviously going to choose in the end).I did find that this book was pretty predictable in some matters, but not in others. When it was first discovered that Shay was the Scion and that the Scion was a ""gift"" or something or another, I groaned, predicting (correctly) how this was going to play out with the union between Calla and Ren. On the other hand, I did think that what happened between Calla and Shay in the cave would eventually happen, I just didn't think that it would happen that suddenly or in that instance. I wish that in that part that it had been more elaborated upon, I found it to be quite rushed (it only took up a couple of pages at most), I would have loved hearing more about the process of transformation and whatnot. So it was nice that some things were still able to take me by surprise (and I am sure that lots will take me by surprise in the next novel in the series, ""Wolfsbane"", as so many questions were left unanswered in this book).I loved the secondary characters in this book (which is also quite surprising as I typically loathe them). I found them to be so dynamic and multi-faceted. For instance, Sabine, the obvious bitchy/ slutty girl, who despite it all, is obviously an extremely caring person as she does everything in her power to protect her pack member, Cosette, from the big bad world, Neville, the quiet boy whose music and poetry speak volumes, and Ansel, the little brother, who throughout the novel is discovering himself and what he wants in life, all the while, protecting his older sister, no matter the cost to himself.All in all, this is a great book (both the story and the cover).

The lines between friendship and duty are sometimes blurred for Amir and later it is an act of betrayal that eventually consumes Amir and causes him so much pain in his life.

It opened my heart and my mind. The depth of sadness and humanity is felt within the first few pages.The author is able to make us feel what living in Afghanistan was like before the Soviets took over and before the Taliban began its reign of terror.

Hosseini's story is told through the eyes of Amir, the son of a wealthy and prominent man in Afghanistan. Amir's best friend Hassan, is also his father's servant's son. The lines between friendship and duty are sometimes blurred for Amir and later it is an act of betrayal that eventually consumes Amir and causes him so much pain in his life. We witness his fears, insecurities and guilt and the internal struggle to do what is right.It is truly a story of betrayal and redemption with family loyalties at stake, hidden family secrets and childhood friendship borne of innocence and doomed by one single act.The storyline of this book will stay with you, haunt you. It opened my heart and my mind. The depth of sadness and humanity is felt within the first few pages.The author is able to make us feel what living in Afghanistan was like before the Soviets took over and before the Taliban began its reign of terror.

That said, I am impressed with Wally Lamb's writing, because he genuinely fooled me into thinking he was a female writer.  It also helped that I got the audio book featuring the performing talent of the impressive Linda Stephens.Delores Price is a sad person whose life story begins in 1956 when her family gets a TV set as a gift to her family through the courtesy of her philandering father's mistress.  Delores recounts the destruction of herself and her family from that first day when she is merely 4 years old, a dismal tale of a child who goes largely ignored after her mother has a miscarriage, effectively ignoring her little girl, and her father begins to become more verbally and physically abusive.  Her father eventually leaves Delores and her mother until her mother has a mental breakdown and our poor little heroine is sent off to live with her grandmother, a racist, Bible-belting harpie who makes her success with other neighborhood children virtually impossible.  Eventually, Delores's mother comes back home from the hospital, gets a new job, and starts dating lots of guys--including sleeping with the married boarder upstairs who ends up raping a 13 year-old Dolores.  From there on things get worse.  Dolores gets fat, her mother fights with her constantly until she is killed by a drunk driver, and then Delores goes off to college, suffering one embarrassing situation after another until a family friend pays for a seven year stay in a mental institution.  Through unfinished therapy and a bad marriage, this girl goes through everything you can imagine, and then some.  This book is fast paced and throws in every situation imaginable until it plays out like a controversial and tacky miniseries.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, however.  Along the way, Lamb puts in some great laugh-out-loud dialog along with some truly disturbing and tear-jerking moments.If you love very highly charged stories with lots of tragedy and trash, you will love this book.  There are some very touching people in this story, and Lamb shows that people are neither good nor bad--we all have moments of weakness as much as our better traits--and nobody is infallible.  If this book seems too trashy and rediculous to swallow, I would recommend somebody more on the level of Meg Hutchinson.  Personally, I enjoyed it, but I wouldn't get it for keeps.

Whatever I had expected from this third and final book in the trilogy, it definitely wasn't this...At the end of ""Catching Fire"", Katniss and 2 of the other contestants have been broken out of the arena by the rebels.  When Katniss finally wakes up from a drug induced stupor, it was to find that Peeta has been captured by the Capitol, and that District 12 has been turned into a pile of smoldering ash by President Snow's fire bombs.  Katniss, her childhood friend Gale, and her mother and sister all end up living in District 13, a district that serves as the base of the rebels and a district whose existence President Snow has taken great pains to conceal.  Life in District 13 is not easy, as your every movement is planned out through a rigidly set schedule and every scrap of food you eat is rationed.  To top it all off, the rebel leaders are determined to make Katniss the symbol of their cause without giving her any real power, while far away in the Capitol Peeta is being tortured for his associations with her.  What is Katniss to do, and does she have what it takes to become The Mockingjay, the symbol of rebellion that the rebel leaders want her to be?If you start this third book in the trilogy expecting more of the same, you are in for a big surprise.  Gone are the hunger games, and gone are the moments of triumph that brought some much-needed lightness to its two predecessors.  Instead, this book is grim and bleak - each word, each passage mired in such hopelessness that you just know it's not going to get better..that it can't get any better without the author compromising the integrity of the book.  With President Snow torturing Peeta in the Capitol in an attempt to break her, Katniss has become a brittle husk of her former self - jumping at shadows, going through her days in drug-induced stupor as she tries to forget what has happened to Peeta, to her friends back at District 12.  As a matter of fact, despite her best efforts, throughout most of the book she is merely a pawn in the hands of the rebels as they wrest for control of the districts, just like she was President Snow's pawn in the hunger games.  She did come up for air a couple of times during the book, as rage at what the Capitol is doing to Peeta and the determination not to let President Snow win give her some needed incentive to stand up and help the rebels succeed, but those moments of brilliance are often short lived.  Often, just when it looks like she's about to triumph and rise above herself, something tragic would occur to turn her back into this hollow shell for whom even going through the motion of living is a chore.  And then there's Peeta, a formerly loving and gentle character rendered unrecognizable by his torture at the hands of President Snow. We do get to see a lot of Gale in this book, but what we get to see if often not flattering, as Gale's hatred of the Capitol often paints him as a guy who would be willing to do anything to crush the Capitol regardless of the loss of human lives.Intellectually, I can understand why the author chose to go down this route, and that maybe, she had to go down this route.  After all, it was clear even from the beginning that this trilogy is more than just an adventure story, that it is about the lasting effects of war and the myriad of questions they raise.  Another side of me, however, still cannot help but wish for a happier ending for the characters that we have come to care about. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3492, 3506)",1,0.0,False

The depth of these characters are necessary: the author switches point of view frequently between a set of characters in this novel.

Factions were created to eliminate undesirable qualities but on the contrary, it simply forces people to go too much the other way.

I think the character development in this novel was excellent. As Tris fights for what she wants, she matures and becomes a very different person, or rather, discovers who she really was to begin with. The secondary characters are also very enjoyable to get to know as they each have a distinct personality.

We meet a few male characters early on and for every single one I asked the question, ""Is this her love interest?"".

Panem is made up of 12 districts and the Capitol, all controlled by President Snow and various other members of the Capitol city. The citizens of the rest of the 12 districts exist only to provide for the Capitol; provide food, clothing, medicine, coal and very importantly, entertainment.Many years past, the citizens of the 13 original districts had risen up to rebel against a very unfair living arrangement. District 13 was obliterated and the Hunger Games were begun as a way to control the other districts. Each year, a boy and a girl from each district, between the ages of 12 and 17, is ""reaped"", their names chosen from a list of all of the children in that district. Once chosen, those two children join the 22 others from the remaining districts for a fight to the death in an arena, termed the Hunger Games. This spectacle is broadcast as required watching for all citizens of Panem, who in the 12 districts get to watch those they know and love get brutally murdered by other children.In District 12, Katniss Everdeen, a 16 year old living in the poorest of the districts, supports her mother and beloved younger sister, Prim, with her illegal hunting and creative ways of providing for her family.On the day of the reaping this year, Prim is the one whose name is chosen. Katniss immediately volunteers to go for Prim instead. In her mind, she has agreed to die for her but cannot bear the thought of Prim dying in the Games.What unfolds from here is a spectacular tale of rising up against oppression, with Katniss becoming the symbol for the rebellion. She is joined in the Hunger Games by the first of two love interests, Peeta, who is a baker's son she's known for years.Throughout this story (it is truly one long story broken into three parts), the author does an amazing job of writing flawed characters. Put into this world, there are few who are selfless, or even marginally kind. Katniss herself is surly at best, having been forced to care for her family since her father died when she was 11. For any young adult reading this novel, it truly shows how a young girl feels inside at this age; not always able to see the true motives of those around her or believe the truly good things about herself.This story also a commentary on many social and political issues, interspersed with lessons about what should and should not be trusted in life. The politics of those on Katniss' own side of the war, for example, is a lesson on how those in power are those who disseminate the information, and how they spin it and whether how they act on in is in the best interest of the people. It is a lesson on how human beings treat each other and why, how arbitrary things are in life and how betrayal is a part of that.Although these books were written for YA, they are easily accessible for adults. I found myself riveted, in no small part because of how much the author made me root for Katniss. She is an extremely complicated character, but one I would want on my side in a rough situation. She can't help but protect those who are smaller or weaker than she is, and even those who aren't. She is cold and calculating, though, which makes her decisions and her words unlikable at times, but she is as real a character as I've ever read.I was struck by the more esoteric parts of Suzanne Collins' writing as well. For example, she references other literature, most notably numbering Katniss' army squadron (from the final book, Mockingjay) 451. The numbers have no meaning in the army, and this number is most easily remembered from Ray Bradbury's tale, Fahrenheit 451, another futuristic story about government control. This is only one reference, however. She uses character's names (eg. Cressida, Castor, Pollux) to further reference historical and literary ideas, as well as metaphorical ideas (naming the very evil President Snow, whose breath smells like blood and roses).In all, these novels are well-worth reading for those of all ages who like a gripping futuristic tale that isn't all that far-fetched.

It wasn't an easy road, because honestly nothing has ever been easy for Qhuinn.Lots of things happen in the BDB world.  The Band of Bastards, lead by Xcor, are still on their mission to dethrone Wrath with some shady faction of the glymera.  Assail continues to build the empire that Rhevenge let go of months (or at least I think it's months) before.  Trez and iAm, the Shadow bodyguards from Rhevenge's days as the Reverand, get a bit more of a storyline as Trez tries to avoid a commitment he's had since the day he was born.  And then there was the weird storyline with Assail and Sola, a cat burglar who Assail becomes ""involved"" with.  This was a lot of action and there were times when I was completely about who and what was going on.  For the first time ever, I had a sticky note attached to my Fire to help me keep everything straight.  Did things really need to be that complicated??  And to be honest, I could have cared less about all of that....I just wanted Blay and Qhuinn.And we did get Blay and Qhuinn.  From the opening prologue, all I wanted to do was find Qhuinn and give him a big hug.  He tore my heart open and I wanted him to find someway to find where he belonged.  Of course, I knew that was with Blay, but Qhuinn really needed to work through issues with his past and his own sexuality before he could really ever be happy.  Of course, being Qhuinn and having that sometimes thick head of his, it takes him practically until the last page to finally have the light bulb come on, but when it did it was like a tremendous weight was lifted off his shoulders.On the flip side of that relationship we have Blay.  Blay who's still in love with Qhuinn but dating Saxton.  Blay who can cut Qhuinn to the core with a look or a few words, but can't help but still be drawn to him.  My problem with Blay was how he treated Qhuinn for most of the book.  He was unbelievable harsh.  So harsh I spent most of the time I was reading wanting to cause bodily harm to him myself.  Blay put up an emotional wall to try and protect himself from being sucked into Qhuinn's world again, but as he did that he cut Qhuinn down...a lot.  Nothing was more harsh than when Blay and Qhuinn were in the hallway down in the clinic and Blay fileted Qhuinn.  Sure I can understand why he wanted to protect himself from someone he didn't think could love him forever, but given the emotional state Qhuinn was in for most of the 591 pages, I would have thought Blay would have truly recognized that acting like he was wasn't the best way to get things across to Qhuinn.That leaves Layla.  I'm on the fence about her.  Given what happened between Layla and Qhuinn in the last book, I would have thought she'd have a bigger role in this book.  She was there, but she had as much ""page time"" as all the other side storylines.  I question her judgement because of her fascination with a certain vampire and wonder that will mean down the road with her, Qhuinn and... (trying to avoid spoilers).  To be honest, I could do without her.  She's never been the ""sharpest pencil in the box"" and I atrributed that to being sequestered all those years with the Scribe Virgin.  But now I just don't think she'll be good for anyone and cause much bigger issues.I really, really enjoyed this one.  The emotionally charged story between Blay and Qhuinn reminded of Zsadist's story and it had me hooked from the very beginning.  I could have done with less of the other storylines (see my comments about the sticky note above) because really all I wanted was for Blay and Qhuinn to finally get together and to see what those Bands of Bastards were up to.  However, the continuation of the BDB world has been set up perfectly and I will now need to sit back and wait for next March to see what JR Ward has in store for us next.

Sure I can understand why he wanted to protect himself from someone he didn't think could love him forever, but given the emotional state Qhuinn was in for most of the 591 pages, I would have thought Blay would have truly recognized that acting like he was wasn't the best way to get things across to Qhuinn.That leaves Layla.  I'm on the fence about her.  Given what happened between Layla and Qhuinn in the last book, I would have thought she'd have a bigger role in this book.  She was there, but she had as much ""page time"" as all the other side storylines.  I question her judgement because of her fascination with a certain vampire and wonder that will mean down the road with her, Qhuinn and... (trying to avoid spoilers).  To be honest, I could do without her.  She's never been the ""sharpest pencil in the box"" and I atrributed that to being sequestered all those years with the Scribe Virgin.  But now I just don't think she'll be good for anyone and cause much bigger issues.I really, really enjoyed this one.  The emotionally charged story between Blay and Qhuinn reminded of Zsadist's story and it had me hooked from the very beginning.  I could have done with less of the other storylines (see my comments about the sticky note above) because really all I wanted was for Blay and Qhuinn to finally get together and to see what those Bands of Bastards were up to.  However, the continuation of the BDB world has been set up perfectly and I will now need to sit back and wait for next March to see what JR Ward has in store for us next.

I was getting a bit bogged down with reading it. I think my favorite section was the introduction. In the author's introduction she mentions Rosa Parks and a few other famous people. There's a questionnaire to find out whether you are more of an introvert or extrovert or in-between. For myself, I definitely am an introvert. She also explains the psychology of introversion/extroversion.There are four parts to this book. In Part Two: The Extrovert Ideal, Susan Cain mentions Dale Carnegie and the changes that he went through and became a great public speaker. Shealso talks about the Tony Robbins seminar (he was driving be bonkers), the Harvard Business School, Saddleback Church, plus many other studies and examples.Part Two: Your Biology, Your Self? has many example of people who were/are extroverts/introverts. I did finally find a nugget that I liked. On page 173, it says,""If you are an introvert, find your flow by using your gifts. You have the power of persistence, the tenacity to solve complex problems, and the clear-sightedness to avoid pitfalls that trip others up....So stay true to your own nature. If you like to do things in a slow and steady way [I do], don't let others make you feel as if you have to race.""Part Three: Do All Cultures Have An Extrovert Ideal? and Part Four: How To Love, How to Work, I will not write much about. I skipped over most chapters.The conclusion has a quotation that I like. It's from Anais Nin and it says, ""Our culture made a virtue of living only as extroverts. We discouraged the inner journey, the quest for a center. So we lost our center and have to find it again.""Susan Cain shares some ideas for those who are extroverts wanting to help introverts or those who are introverts themselves. I like this, especially since I myself was a quiet child and my children are more quiet (in public anyway): ""If your children are quiet, help them make peace with new situations and new people, but otherwise let them be themselves. Delight in the originality of their minds. Take pride in the strength of their consciences and the loyalty of their friendships. Don't expect them to follow the gang. Encourage them to follow their passions instead.

So far I've finished the first book and have not read the second or third (until I lose interest, I'm on the waiting list to get them at the library--I'd rather wait than actually buy the books). Before I read this book, from what I heard I assumed Ana and Christian executed the contract, had a D/S relationship going on, and she left when he went too far. I also thought both characters were older (especially Christian--27 is eyebrow-raising age for someone who's amassed such incredible wealth). Not so. In the entire first book the heroine agonizes over whether or not to sign the D/S contract, and whether or not this is what she wants for her first sexual relationship--and in fact she does not sign the contract. They never truly get into the D/S so the issues I thought might be raised--like will she find a paradoxical ""freedom"" or newfound self-confidence in being a submissive--never arise. (For a good movie about how a couple starts off in a D/S relationship and finds a way to translate it to everyday life, I'd suggest 'Secretary' starring Maggie Gyllenhall.)I'm not going to summarize ""Fifty Shades"" or address the ""retro"" message people have major problems with: if it bothers you in x-rated romance fiction I don't know why you'd pick up this book. What bothered me more than anything is how Ana expected and insisted on having a ""plain vanilla"" relationship with Christian--and had the laughable presumption to believes she could change him!--after he explicitly told her: I don't do flowers and romance; I don't have girlfriends; I cut ties with three former subs because they wanted more from me than I was capable of giving; ""I'm fifty shades of f***** up."" If that is how he wants to live his life and experience the other sex in consensual relationships, who is she to demand more from him? I don't see how she's so special Christian should be fascinated with her to the point he forgets the needs that have driven his chosen lifestyle. This goes back to the Twilight/Bella parallel another reviewer pointed out. Anastasia really is Bella, only she gets to have lots of sex. Even the tea Ana prefers (English breakfast) is boring.Ana knows what she's getting into. She chooses to pursue Christian even though she anticipates it will not end well and he will break her heart, because the attraction between them is so strong; but she makes the fatal mistake of believing she can change him. When that doesn't work, she flies out at him and dramatically leaves. I sympathize with Ana, I really do. When I was a college student younger than she, dating my first boyfriend, I ended up wanting more from him. When I realized I would never get it I broke up with him and it was extremely painful. Had I heeded the writing on the wall that was there at the beginning, I could have spared myself a solid week of tears and freakishly swollen eyes. For someone who's supposed to be so intelligent and mature, poor Ana makes another classic relationship newb mistake: asking extremely personal, inappropriate jealous questions about her boyfriend's exes. I had to laugh. I won't even go into the emails other than to say there were too many of them, and it was quaint to see a college student in the year 2011 emailing a guy back and forth like Bridget Jones' Diary ca. 1996. Kids today text.Like some other reviewers I also had problems with the Britishisms. Why bother setting the book in the US if you refer to Christian's gray ""flannel"" pants (I think she means ""slacks""), ""ringing"" someone on the telephone, going to the ""cinema"" or use ""bloody"" as a curse word? That's simply not done here and makes it painfully obvious the writer doesn't know her chosen setting. Of course the same applies to American writers trying to set stories in Britain (and I'm looking at you, American writers who use modern colloquial/anachronistic phrases in Regency romances). If Ms. James had followed the maxim, ""write what you know"" for the setting, the result would have been less distracting. In that same vein, I found it very improbable that Christian's parents are a doctor and a lawyer, and yet are so rich they live on an ""estate"" and have ""staff."" The vast majority doctors and lawyers in this country are not millionaires. Either Christian's parents are extremely successful leaders in their fields who must work all the time, or they come from wealth (or both I guess)--but that's not explained.I decided to give the book three stars because it interested me enough to want to find out how Christian and Ana ultimately get to the happy ending that must be coming. The sex was nothing that shocked me. For the record I'm a married woman in my 20s, and I've never been able to orgasm with the amazing frequency and ease Anastasia does without using a vibrator. I guess some women do, even having never so much as ""touched"" themselves before their first time. Mazel tov. I'm interpreting this aspect of the book as fanciful.

Conflicted. Frustrated. I don't know what to do. Well...I know what I have to do but that doesn't mean that I am going to like doing it. When you know the capabilities of an author...a character...a story line...and when you love it so passionately, anything less than amazing is not good enough. That's what I'm faced with here. I feel like Real set the bar of what I was expecting for the whole series&#8230;and Mine did not measure up in my book. Stone me now&#8230;curse me if you will, believe me, the words that I have to say are not fun for me to admit&#8230;but I can&#8217;t lie about how I feel.Brooke Dumas...did I love everything about Brooke in Real - not exactly but I got over it because for some reason, on some level I connected with her and felt for her. So all the annoying stuff kind of...didn&#8217;t matter. I know it doesn't make a lot of sense but it works in my crazy brain. Well in the beginning of Mine, Brooke drove me about 10 shades of crazy with some of her antics and logic. If you are going to make decisions and then get mad at the results of those decisions...it's time for you to grow up! She was being completely irrational and utterly annoying at times. Drove me bonkers! Because that's not the Brooke I loved in Real. Then, it was like a heavenly light opened up and finally I got my Brooke back. She was strong, not only for herself but for Remy, I loved the way she handled him and their relationship and just&#8230;everything. I was proud of her and how far they had come together.&#8216;I&#8217;ve been broken and put together again.I&#8217;ve been loved, and I have loved.I&#8217;m in love, and I will be forever changed by this man. I used to dream of medals and championships, but now I dream solely of a blue-eyes fighter who one day changed my life, when he put his lips on mine&#8230;&#8217;Remy...Remington Tate deserves a million stars. Ten million. Alright infinity stars - there...it's settled. He is not perfect...he has flaws...he has issues and he is no where near infallible...but the man is so freakin&#8217; in love with Brooke it makes my heart soar. Remy is like no other book bf&#8230;he defies categories and logic because even his wrongs add up to so much right. The #1 thing that has me excited about Remy is the prospect of being in his head. He's just...*sigh*...there are no words. Well...there are actually lots of words....like loving, strong, protective, kind, sexy, alpha, dominating, endearing...he's just so complex and the more I get to know about him the more I crave him. There are so many layers to this chess playing, @#$ kicking, Brooke loving lion. He's like a drug and I totally want to be on a Remy high...forever.&#8216;And I want him like my next breath.I want him more than any one of these screaming women wants im.I want every fragmented part of him. I want his body. His mind. His heart. His beautiful soul.He says he&#8217;s mine, but I know that there&#8217;s a part of Remington Tate nobody will ever have.I am his, but he is untamable and unconquerable.The only one who can defeat Remington Tate is himself.&#8217;The thing that kept this book from being another 5++++ book was the repetitiveness. It was out of control...enough to the point where I was rolling my eyes. A lot. I loathe repetitiveness...I've stopped reading books because of it. What do I mean by repetitiveness? A few examples...talking about &#8216;his hair&#8217;, &#8216;his abs&#8217;, &#8216;his eyes&#8217; &#8211; I get it&#8230;the dude&#8217;s gorgeous, I&#8217;m aware. I love his looks&#8230;but I don't need to be reminded of them all the time, and it was constant. If that was all the repetitiveness then maybe I could have handled it better, but it was also using the same words, over and over, to describe the same things. I didn't understand the point and unfortunately, I needed more than that. They have this great and amazing love and connection &#8211; build off of that. Expand! They&#8217;ve not been in a relationship for that long, I wanna see all of those moments! So what kept me going? One word. Remy. Plain and simple. That's it - his character completely carried this book and made it worth reading for me. Because any other time I would have stopped reading before I reached 50%. I hate saying that. I hate thinking that. It just...sucks.&#8216;My lungs ache for breath and the rest of me aches for his hands on me. And when my gaze flicks upward to find those blue eyes pinned on mine, his face hurt and sweaty, all the testosterone in the world courses through him, pulling and enveloping me, so I can barely take living right now I want him so much . He makes me feel this all-consuming, soul -searing, heart-wrenching, painful need for him that&#8217;s more than physical, more than emotional.&#8217;I was warned about the repetitiveness too...so I was prepared to possibly hate it and maybe that softened the blow a little bit because while it grated on my nerves, I was able to shrug it off and push forward. If I am being honest, I probably would have DNF&#8217;d it had I not been prepared. That makes me want to cry. But despite the annoyance, I was glad I did read it because there were fleeting glimpses of the amazingness that was in Real. Like the amazing quote worthiness...I did swoon and love all my special little Remy moments...he and Brooke still blew me away with their love and devotion to each other. But then that only makes me wonder if the repetitiveness hadn't been so bad...what could this book have been? It's a sad thought to ponder...&#8216;His words caress me.Nobody ever taught him how to love.He does it instinctively.&#8217;I can't lie...this book did evoke emotions out of me, even though the half of the time the emotions were usually out of frustration, that wasn&#8217;t all I felt&#8230; I already admitted I swooned, but I cried, I gasped, it got to my little feelers...so I did have love for this book and that does mean something to me. I am an emotional reader and if an author can still pull emotion out of me even when I'm at my wits end with frustration...that's saying a lot IMO. I did not see a lot of this plot coming, which is another positive thing. I don't know what I was expecting but the story line was definitely unpredictable and I appreciated that it kept me on my toes. And seriously&#8230;the prologue&#8230;L.O.V.E.D. every word.&#8220;Remy . . .&#8221;&#8220;This is the last time I live without you. I&#8217;m half mad already and halfway into the f^@$ing grave.

Conflicted. Frustrated. I don't know what to do. Well...I know what I have to do but that doesn't mean that I am going to like doing it. When you know the capabilities of an author...a character...a story line...and when you love it so passionately, anything less than amazing is not good enough. That's what I'm faced with here. I feel like Real set the bar of what I was expecting for the whole series&#8230;and Mine did not measure up in my book. Stone me now&#8230;curse me if you will, believe me, the words that I have to say are not fun for me to admit&#8230;but I can&#8217;t lie about how I feel.Brooke Dumas...did I love everything about Brooke in Real - not exactly but I got over it because for some reason, on some level I connected with her and felt for her. So all the annoying stuff kind of...didn&#8217;t matter. I know it doesn't make a lot of sense but it works in my crazy brain. Well in the beginning of Mine, Brooke drove me about 10 shades of crazy with some of her antics and logic. If you are going to make decisions and then get mad at the results of those decisions...it's time for you to grow up! She was being completely irrational and utterly annoying at times. Drove me bonkers! Because that's not the Brooke I loved in Real. Then, it was like a heavenly light opened up and finally I got my Brooke back. She was strong, not only for herself but for Remy, I loved the way she handled him and their relationship and just&#8230;everything. I was proud of her and how far they had come together.&#8216;I&#8217;ve been broken and put together again.I&#8217;ve been loved, and I have loved.I&#8217;m in love, and I will be forever changed by this man. I used to dream of medals and championships, but now I dream solely of a blue-eyes fighter who one day changed my life, when he put his lips on mine&#8230;&#8217;Remy...Remington Tate deserves a million stars. Ten million. Alright infinity stars - there...it's settled. He is not perfect...he has flaws...he has issues and he is no where near infallible...but the man is so freakin&#8217; in love with Brooke it makes my heart soar. Remy is like no other book bf&#8230;he defies categories and logic because even his wrongs add up to so much right. The #1 thing that has me excited about Remy is the prospect of being in his head. He's just...*sigh*...there are no words. Well...there are actually lots of words....like loving, strong, protective, kind, sexy, alpha, dominating, endearing...he's just so complex and the more I get to know about him the more I crave him. There are so many layers to this chess playing, @#$ kicking, Brooke loving lion. He's like a drug and I totally want to be on a Remy high...forever.&#8216;And I want him like my next breath.I want him more than any one of these screaming women wants im.I want every fragmented part of him. I want his body. His mind. His heart. His beautiful soul.He says he&#8217;s mine, but I know that there&#8217;s a part of Remington Tate nobody will ever have.I am his, but he is untamable and unconquerable.The only one who can defeat Remington Tate is himself.&#8217;The thing that kept this book from being another 5++++ book was the repetitiveness. It was out of control...enough to the point where I was rolling my eyes. A lot. I loathe repetitiveness...I've stopped reading books because of it. What do I mean by repetitiveness? A few examples...talking about &#8216;his hair&#8217;, &#8216;his abs&#8217;, &#8216;his eyes&#8217; &#8211; I get it&#8230;the dude&#8217;s gorgeous, I&#8217;m aware. I love his looks&#8230;but I don't need to be reminded of them all the time, and it was constant. If that was all the repetitiveness then maybe I could have handled it better, but it was also using the same words, over and over, to describe the same things. I didn't understand the point and unfortunately, I needed more than that. They have this great and amazing love and connection &#8211; build off of that. Expand! They&#8217;ve not been in a relationship for that long, I wanna see all of those moments! So what kept me going? One word. Remy. Plain and simple. That's it - his character completely carried this book and made it worth reading for me. Because any other time I would have stopped reading before I reached 50%. I hate saying that. I hate thinking that. It just...sucks.&#8216;My lungs ache for breath and the rest of me aches for his hands on me. And when my gaze flicks upward to find those blue eyes pinned on mine, his face hurt and sweaty, all the testosterone in the world courses through him, pulling and enveloping me, so I can barely take living right now I want him so much . He makes me feel this all-consuming, soul -searing, heart-wrenching, painful need for him that&#8217;s more than physical, more than emotional.&#8217;I was warned about the repetitiveness too...so I was prepared to possibly hate it and maybe that softened the blow a little bit because while it grated on my nerves, I was able to shrug it off and push forward. If I am being honest, I probably would have DNF&#8217;d it had I not been prepared. That makes me want to cry. But despite the annoyance, I was glad I did read it because there were fleeting glimpses of the amazingness that was in Real. Like the amazing quote worthiness...I did swoon and love all my special little Remy moments...he and Brooke still blew me away with their love and devotion to each other. But then that only makes me wonder if the repetitiveness hadn't been so bad...what could this book have been? It's a sad thought to ponder...&#8216;His words caress me.Nobody ever taught him how to love.He does it instinctively.&#8217;I can't lie...this book did evoke emotions out of me, even though the half of the time the emotions were usually out of frustration, that wasn&#8217;t all I felt&#8230; I already admitted I swooned, but I cried, I gasped, it got to my little feelers...so I did have love for this book and that does mean something to me. I am an emotional reader and if an author can still pull emotion out of me even when I'm at my wits end with frustration...that's saying a lot IMO. I did not see a lot of this plot coming, which is another positive thing. I don't know what I was expecting but the story line was definitely unpredictable and I appreciated that it kept me on my toes. And seriously&#8230;the prologue&#8230;L.O.V.E.D. every word.&#8220;Remy . . .&#8221;&#8220;This is the last time I live without you. I&#8217;m half mad already and halfway into the f^@$ing grave.

Katniss should be overjoyed, right? Wrong. Whether she likes it or not, her whole world has changed since the second she left the arena. Even though Gale and her family escaped and are alive, District 12 is no more. The only home she has ever known and the only part of her father she had left has been obliterated. And then there is Peeta; Katniss is filled with worry, regret, and an overall state of confusion by the fact that Haymitch just left him in the arena at the mercy of The Capitol! After all the time and effort they spent to keep him alive, how could he just abandon him? The Capitol has him now, and for all she knows he could be dead. Katniss doesn't have much time to fathom many of these shocking truths about her new life though because one seems to dominate them all. District 13 is real, and they are ready for a revolution. But is Katniss?Everyone seems to have a say in what's going on except Katniss! She has no idea or part in her rescue from the Quarter Quail! If she had, things would have been much different! There is no way she would have left Peeta's side, and this idea haunts her constantly. The variables may prove to be too much for Katniss to handle. Just when she thought her life couldn't get more hectic, the unthinkable is asked of her! She has had no voice or knowledge about the rebellion, but these new leaders want her to become the Mockingjay, to fuel it? This decision is a big deal. Not only is this decision crucial to the rebellion's success, but it will result in Katniss having to ignore her feelings of furry and mistrust toward this new government. Her decision may be the deciding factor of the rebellion's outcome, but may end up also being the deciding factor for Peeta's life as well. Can she and will she risk it? But the even bigger question is this; Will Katniss be able to become the Mockingjay if it requires complete dedication, no matter the personal stakes at risk?Suzanne Collins has done it again! Another thrilling addition to the Hunger Games series has been added! Mockingjay is another amazingly well written and engrossing Collins novel. Just like Katniss's  ability to fuel the rebellion against the Capitol as the Mockingjay, Suzanne Collins has become the Mockingjay for the Hunger Games frenzy. She may not have as much risk on the line as her main character, Katniss, but there is one thing that is evident. Whether Collins realized it at first or not, the Hunger Games has officially caught fire, and she is its Mockingjay.Educational Value: 5 out of 5 - One of the qualities of Mockingjay that makes it not only very entertaining but educational as well is that this book stresses that we, the people, should not be scared of our government and encourages us to take a stand for what is right. One of the themes that runs through this series is the multiple injustices that The Capitol has inflicted on its citizens which result in constant whispers of a revolution.This novel itself clearly entices people to take a stand for what they believe! Many people need something to inspire them to have faith in themselves and to take action! Mockingjay may just be that little nudge of hope that people need to take a stand for their beliefs.Entertainment Value: 5 out of 5 -  This novel, along with the other two from its series, is one of the best written novels that our generation has ever seen, and  we owe it all to Suzanne Collins! She did a fantastic job tying love, action, suspense, heartbreak, and sadness into a series! After reading these novels, it appears as if you are a part of the story. It's like you have been through everything the characters have and you seem to have a connection with each one! Everything from the imagery to the plotline is just amazing in Mockingjay! This series seems to be the ""Catching Fire"" of Suzanne Collins' career! I look forward to the rest of her accomplishments as an author.This review was first published on Kindle Kids' Corner @Kindle Nation Daily.@Ebookbelle ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(4126, 4140)",1,0.0,False

Life in Hitler's Germany is tough even for non-Jewish Germans...their food is rationed, there are no extras of anything, there are strict rules to follow and family members may be taken away at any time to serve Hitler in whatever way he so chooses.The families do everything possible to keep life as normal as possible.Hans begins to read with Liesel each night when she wakens from her nightmares, first from A Gravediggers Handbook that Liesel, ""The Book Thief,"" recovered after it was lost in the snow by an apprentice gravedigger at her brother's burial and then from books Liesel steals from the mayor's wife's library.  She later continues her reading and writing lessons in the basement with a Jew named Max (the son of an old friend of Hans) who shows up one night needing help.Life gets tougher on Himmel Street; the war begins spiraling out of control, Jews are marched down the street of Molching on their way to concentration camps, air raid sirens become part of normal life, Rosa loses many of her washing jobs bc of prejudice, and the family is frightened for their lives 24/7 if Max is found in their basement.Is it even possible for this story to have a happy ending?Should it?What I LikedDeath, the narrator - foreshadowing - I could almost hear music...you know the kind that comes on while you're watching a scary movie...the killer is around the corner...if only the heroine could hear the music, right??  That's when everybody starts screaming, ""Don't you go in there, Girl!! Just don't do it!""  Even when you've seen the movie before, you still hope that she won't go in there...that's how this story felt to me.I knew how it would end.  We all do.Liesel - in the past when someone mentioned the name Liesel, I would think of the older sister in ""The Sound of Music""...that won't happen anymore.  This Liesel is unforgettable.  Her strength, her soul, her ability to adjust to her surroundings, her ability to pick up and keep moving, her ability to love, her ability to see the world around her realistically...all of that and more...nevermind the fact that this child is only 9-13 years old throughout the story.Format - I'm sure there's a word for this type of structure, but I don't  know what it is...The narrator, Death, goes back and forth in time as he pleases and interrupts the flow with comments and/or bolded newsflashes of sort.  I would think the danger of this kind of format would be a chopped up feel, but there is none of that here.  Quite the contrary, the most effective flashes and context seem to be incorporated seamlessly this way.Death complaining about having too much on his plate - Most of us see Death as that hooded creature with the scythe...it's a Hollywood version that's become ingrained in our brains.  But, Death as the storyteller in The Book Thief doesn't seem to be a frightening thing at all...the way he gently scoops the victims up in his arms and takes them away, the way Death truly mourns over the lives of worthy humans, the way Death sees all that's happening in the world as a waste, but not something he can stop almost endears him to the reader.  I could go on and on about the symbolism here...how mankind hurts itself over and over, etc. but I'll let you experience that for yourself.The humor - both Death's sarcastic remarks and Liesel and Rudy's attempts to carry on conversations with adult words tickled me from time to time.  I appreciated the ability to have a rest every now and then from subject matter that weighed so heavily on my chest.  The German curse words were my favorites :)The History - once again there are things here that I never even knew about...scores of Jews escaped Germany while they were able and ended up in Australia...hence, Zusak's (an Australian) interest in the Jewish families who survived and the members/branches of those families who were left behind and essentially wiped off the face of the earth.Hans Hubermann - how the heck do you not like a man like Hans?What I Didn't LikeThere is literally nothing about this novel that I didn't like, except of course, the subject matter.  How in the world this part of our history exists completely baffles me.  And, then sometimes it doesn't; I can look around at the world we live in today and see some of the same mindset that guided the worst genocide in our nation's history, and I get scared.  Really.Hitler was one man.One of the statistics Death brings out in this novel is that at one point in history 90% of Germans backed Hitler.90%.Out of every 100 people, 90 of them believed what Hiltler proposed was right and/or believed that his strategies/actions had to happen in order to create a powerful German human race.Even as I type those words, it seems so stupid...like something we'd all snicker at and say the person needs psychiatric help.But, time and time again, things happen that we think never would.How did this happen?90%.It's called blind conformity.It's a disease, and...This book is a classic.Overall RecommendationEverybody needs to read this book.The End.

Perhaps Meyers went this route since it is a young adult series.  But it seemed like an easy way out.  Had she wanted to continue the series, the battle could have occurred with us not knowing the outcome while Jacob flees with Renesmee.

Plus, she fails to resolve that fact that Bella and the Cullen's are okay with letting their kind continue slaughtering humans.  I would have extended the series with the golden eyes growing in numbers and a show down coming against the crimson eyes.  If Bella is such a good person, a natural protector, a shield for others, how can she just go on forever living blissfully knowing her own mother and father, or members of the pack could be slaughtered by vampires that don't care about them?  I just see so much potential in the story once the plot gets beyond Bella's gawking of Edward and her remorse for Jacob.  I daresay it is almost idiotic to go into so much detail about the Volturi and all these vampires and then just say 'the end.'  I see why the reviews are less than the other books, although I have a different set of reasons than most.  The birth scene didn't bother me, nor did the lack of romance at the honeymoon.  People get hung up on the most banal things.  I actually think this was the best book by far as it was easily the most compelling.  But Meyers blew it by wrapping everything into a nice little bow and ending it so suddenly.  I am not against happy endings, but in this case it is just too much.  Even fantasy worlds wouldn't have endings like this.  Come on.  That and the gaping moral loophole that I mentioned just leave me thinking Meyers got tired of the series and threw in the towel.  The Volturi should have been destroyed.  They are murderers!  Hello?  And then the Cullens should have become the new rule setters and forced their breed to go 'vegetarian' or be torn apart and burned.Anyway.  I recommend Gabaldon's Outlander series to you all.

I keep cheering them on to make it work because they have that special connection that is only between the two of them. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1137, 1151)",2,0.0,False

I don't think this is close to another ""Hunger Games"" but it shouldn't be.  Who wants to read the same book over and over again?  ""Divergent"" has an amazing plot and I think its a fairly unique one when you think about how many dystopian novels are hitting the shelves.  The story is basically about a world where there are five different 'factions' that people are associated with.  They live for these factions and work for these factions and have their entire belief systems set up to define the type of person an individual is.  Tris is a teenage girl who has been raised to be Abnegation, a selfless faction whose core belief is putting other before yourself.  When she comes of age and is able to choose for herself she decides to leave her family and faction and join the Dauntless, the brave and fearless faction who runs patrols around the border to ensure everyone's security.I had several important questions that never found sufficient answers and that is why I ended up giving the book three stars instead of more.  What is Divergent? That question is never really answered.  Sure its a person who has more than one faction that they show aspects of.  Yet so do other characters in the story who are not considered Divergent.  Also why is this world the way it is?  How did these factions come to be and why are the citizens so easily manipulated into these factions?  Why are people rebelling?I did like the characters a lot and as I mentioned earlier the plot moved along at a nice pace.  I especially like that the heroine is not a girly girl and is mentioned as having a childlike body and few curves.  I think that made her feel different than some of our other YA heroines.  I never really felt like Tris's friends were really friends and perhaps thats the way the story is intended.The resolution to the story is a little too quickly wrapped up and yet it was positively a thrilling conclusion and I think the author made some very brave choices in where to take the story and the characters.  Things are wrapped up pretty nicely although of course not everything is resolved so that the reader is left wanting to know more.  I just hope that the follow up gives up more background and also makes the explaination for a Divergent more clear.  I felt like the story told us what to believe but didn't really explain why we should believe.

The man has a gift for storytelling in his creativity and his imagination, there's no denying this. However, his characters are a bit...lacking. I think it says a lot about a fantasy author from what type of setting he chooses to set his story in, since you can basically choose anything. Martin chose a medieval type setting, where the men are strong, decisive, brave, cruel, and MANLY (well, except the eunuchs), and women are boring. Almost every woman he writes is so preoccupied with sex, being a whore, her husband, being a whore, wanting power for her son, being a whore, getting married to a prince, being a whore, or stabbing people in the back. I'd say the only females not concerned with these things are too young, but Martin is not above pedophilia.

It's not like he's a pedophile, he wants to protect her and be there for her. Be anything Renesmee needs him to be. That's just how it is. The ending is satisfying- everyone stays as family.

Recently ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" has been creating the same sort of public reaction. Fortunately, there's a little more in ""Girl"" to hold a readers attention and worth the price of the trip that author Stieg Larsson takes you on.""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" is the dual story of Mikael Blomkvist, a crusading financial reporter in Stockholm, and Lisbeth Salander (a play on salamander?), an anti-social possibly mentally ill but gifted private investigator.As ""The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo"" starts Mikael Blomkvist has been found guilty of Swedish libel laws because he wrote a story about a prominent industrialist that he couldn't back up with documentation. Mikael takes a leave of absence from his magazine, Millennium, until the heat is off. Mikael accepts a position from Henrik Vanger, the head of another prominent industrialist family to ostensibly write a chronicle of the Vanger family history. Mikael's actual assignment is find the killer of Harriet Vanger who disappeared off an island at a family gathering while the island was cut off from the mainland. The classic murder in a locked room scenario. As Mikael crawls through the Vanger family history he discovers a family that put the dysfunction in dysfunctional. There are Nazi's in the family, religious zealotry, abusive parents, promiscuous children, relatives who embrace the family and relatives trying to disavow the family connection at all costs. A little bit of something for everybody.The parallel story is, of course, Lisbeth Salander's. Lisbeth is literally ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo."" Lisbeth is a ward of the state, although in her mid 20's, her life has been held in check because of a mysterious childhood incident that has put her at the mercy of a failed system and corrupt guardians. Lisbeth has a very subjective moral code that deals mostly in black and white assumptions of people. Her saving grace is her abilities to find information via computer (a hacker) and her job as a freelance private detective.I don't read a lot of mystery's, but I found a lot of the plot points to be pretty transparent that details seemingly mentioned off handedly by characters are going to be important in the solution to the mystery, almost like having it highlighted IMPORTANT POINT HERE! The motivating reason for Mikael to move to Hedeby, to solve the mystery of the missing and presumed dead Harriet is predicated on an obvious bit of misdirection in a basic misunderstanding of motives. I think it is assumed by the author that the reader will assume the interpretation of the characters is correct.The title of the book when it was published in Sweden was ""Men Who Hate Women."" I read an interview with the U.S. publisher of ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" and the title and cover design were made more intriguing for the U.S. audience. But ""Men Who Hate Women"" (if not as catchy and intriguing) is a more apt and descriptive title of what the book is about. Early on Lisbeth is given very little to do with the main plot of finding the murderer of Harriet Vanger, but she runs into her own man who hates women. The development of Lisbeth's character is slow in coming, the bits and pieces of her back story are intriguing and develop a mystique around her; Larsson is slow to get her into the central mystery of the story.You're probably thinking that with all those shortcomings this is an unfavorable review. No, despite these shortcomings ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" works. The story is simple but elegantly constructed and I found it to be entertaining and readable. The main characters are sympathetic despite their flaws. The bits and pieces we're given of Lisbeth at the beginning are intriguing, like lightning flashes in the dark, we want to see more than her silhouette. Mikael for his faults is a sympathetic character and as he lurches about in the Vanger family history we learn he's basically a decent person, but compared to the Vanger family, most other families would be considered normal. We're also given villains to be shocked at, and not one, but at least three love stories. As all the threads of the mystery are pulled together they seem natural and organic to the characters, no details of the mystery are obscured from the reader, there's no left field revelation that appears out of no where in the solution of the mystery and there's no dues ex machina in it's solution.The proof of the success of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is, is the reader interested in the characters enough to go along and see what happens in the next book of the trilogy?

I will definitely be checking out other works from this author, and can't wait to see what happens to this world in future works. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(896, 910)",1,0.0,False

I have a lot to say about this book and I felt like after I read this book, I was letting so many other blogger's opinions of the novel get to me so I decided to close Goodreads and just write my damn review. I've always prided myself on giving honest and truthful reviews no matter what other people say/think. This book garnered A LOT of controversy and flack and I can see why but I will also sit here and defend my opinion of this novel because you know what? I freaking loved it. I loved this book.First of all, this book reminded me of the show Intervention or Hoarders...the people on those shows are complete and utter train wrecks. Hot messes. Totally unable to understand why they do what they do. But I still watch it. Each and every time. I even ENJOY and look forward to watching these train wrecks. Why? I don't know. I just do. I'm guessing I'm not the only one either, otherwise the shows would be off the air. Anyways, Beautiful Disaster is kind of like those shows. Abby and Travis are train wrecks themselves. They have unhealthy personality traits and an unhealthy relationship. But the thing is...I've been there. I've seen it. And I've also seen it work out for the better like it does in this book. In my opinion, a lot of  the ""reasons"" people didn't like this book so much has me scratching my head. A lot of people call Travis abusive and I straight up disagree. I've seen firsthand what an abusive relationship is, and I do not feel that Travis is abusive to Abby in the least bit. Does he have some anger/obsessive personality traits? Yes. But he doesn't hit her, he doesn't call her a bitch or a skank or verbally abuse her. He just doesn't always communicate his feelings in the most appropriate ways... and you know what? Neither do I. Neither do a lot of people. It doesn't mean they are abusive people. The other thing that has me scratching my head is that people are getting SO UPSET over Travis and Abby's relationship when I can think of a hundred other books that make me cringe with the way they portray the relationship. 50 Shade of Grey? That is NOT a healthy relationship but instead of beating it to a pulp, people are eating it up! Twilight...ugh... don't even get me started. I'd much rather have a protagonist like Abby, who is smart, witty and stands up for herself than a character like Bella Swan. But the thing people are also forgetting is that in this book, Travis and Abby's relationship DOESN'T work until they figure out who they are separately and how to fix what's broken in them. When they are able to face their own demons, the become the very best of themselves and then the relationship is able to prosper. Which I think is a beautiful, beautiful thing. Everyone always says pessimistically, ""people never change,"" but I disagree. Sometimes, when it's with the right person and for the right reasons, people can and will change.Okay, now that I got that part out of the way, the other reasons why I love this book.... I thought that ALL characters were fabulous and I thought they all broke down the stereotype that I initially thought they'd all be in. Abby is a ""good"" girl, smart, driven and yet... she has a troubled past, she's a smart ass and even she is not without temptation to the badass hotties. Travis is the tattooed fighter that has an enormous ego...yet he's smart and affectionate and has a vulnerability that is adorable. America...oh, America. She is the best friend every person should have. Loyal to a fault, protective and yet just brave enough to encourage her friend to do some stupid things. But it's in the little details that make me love America. A couple of her off-hand comments that make me feel like she and Abby have an incredibly close friendship. I even like Shepley, who reminds me so much of one of my friends. I liked the premise of the novel, though I found that to be secondary to my attachment to the characters. Was it a little unrealistic? Yeah. Did I care? Nope. I've been reading for so long that I'm the type of reader that is able to suspend belief, even in a contemporary novel, if A. I like the characters and the plot enough and B. if it was written well enough. In my opinion, McGuire did both of these things, so the unrealistic parts didn't bother me. Actually, I kind of enjoyed it because I thought it put a twist on Abby's story and made her seem that much more interesting.One last thing. I know a lot of people were annoyed with Travis's pet name for Abby... but I loved it. I actually ADORED it. Maybe that's because in my relationship and close friendships with people, I have a rather unorthodox/silly/stupid nickname that seems ridiculous to the rest of the world but to those that are involved...it shows me how much I mean to them.Honestly, the only thing that REALLY bothered me in this entire story is that McGuire used a lot of unnecessary dialogue attributions and she said so and so ""laughed once,"" about a million times within the book and it annoyed the crap out of me. That was my only minor nitpick.Overall, I loved this book. I read it in less than 8 hours and relished every moment with the cast. Obviously, just by seeing the Goodreads reviews, this book is not for everyone and honestly, I don't even know how to recommend it since so many different people seem to either love or hate it. So I guess my advice is... proceed with caution BUT don't ruin your judgement of the book by reading all the one or five star reviews. Find out for yourself. If I had followed some of my fellow bloggers instead of my own heart, I would have never picked up this book and that would have been a really sad thing.

Now I've read the first 3 of this now and I think it's interesting to read the reviews now vs the time they were written.Just sticking to this 1st book, overall I agree with the reviews and ratings. It's an excellent story and excellent writing. The one thing that is different now than then is that it is no longer unique. Many fantasy books (and more importantly perhaps, movies) have created whole new worlds and I don't find Jordan's that different really (replace Orges with Trollocs and Clerics with Aes Sedai, etc). Sure it's different, but not amazingly so. Also, the 3 main character theme vs the traditional one is now old hat thanks to Harry Potter, Percy Jackson and decent supporting cast TV shows (Stargate, Firefly) and movies. So again, at the time, this was all breakthrough and wonderful, but reading it now it's great, but not shocking is all.What I actually find great about these books is the pace at which they move, given the sheer size of each book. The interest, suspense and action all keep moving and while each book is a story in its own, also ties to the larger arc. Well done there.Jordan captures the gender stereotypes well also. Again, new at the time to have main female characters and strong female characters, but old now (and somewhat overdone, especially in TV/movie areas). What might be nice is to see smart male characters. What I find lacking in a lot of fantasy novels is any real politics/trade discussions. Ok, so not as exciting as swashbuckling perhaps, but would be nice to have more depth from time to time.Anyway, based on only 3 books of the series, this is great overall and I'm looking forward to more. But in that I'm also looking for more character and world development along with arc continuations.Edit:Now I've read the 1st 6 books and I can say the story has kept up it's good pace and intrigue, and characters have changed, developed, which is good. I particularly like that we see more of the world and its politics and slowly see more of the Dark One's plans/actions.I suppose at this point there are only 2 things that are bothering me. First, the repeated and dominant use of the device of Person A believes that Person B needs to be protected (from others and themselves) and doesn't need to be asked/included in discussions - the condescending paternalist attitude that constantly leads to missed communication and crossed goals. Once or twice, fine, but it's always there.Related to this is the constant Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus aspect. One might expect the average person in the story to adopt these views, but these characters are not average. Perhaps it's a reinforcement of the story setting where no one is enlightened and all kings are blood-thirsty savages with no brains that need Aes Sedai to guide them and all women are helpless and need men around to protect them, but I seem to have higher expectations.Edit update: 1/3 of the way through Book 10Ok, things did slow down a bit.

I'm in my 40's I'm not exactly in the demographics for this book.  Recently I caught the movie on Netflix and really enjoyed it.  Figured the book had to have more information about everything (books are always better than the movie) - so I picked the book up (well rented it on my Kindle Fire).  AND I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN.  I had seen the movie, I knew actually how it ended, but I was so totally enthralled with the story.  It is a very interesting and very well written story.  As soon as I finished it, I wanted to start reading the second book.  In fact, I just started reading the second book yesterday.  I sat and read for 7 hours last night.

I'm in my 40's I'm not exactly in the demographics for this book.  Recently I caught the movie on Netflix and really enjoyed it.  Figured the book had to have more information about everything (books are always better than the movie) - so I picked the book up (well rented it on my Kindle Fire).  AND I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN.  I had seen the movie, I knew actually how it ended, but I was so totally enthralled with the story.  It is a very interesting and very well written story.  As soon as I finished it, I wanted to start reading the second book.  In fact, I just started reading the second book yesterday.  I sat and read for 7 hours last night.
