My husband though thought the tenders were a bit softer. All the tonkatsu were extremely well made. The not smothered by sauce half was beautifully breaded and stayed really crunchy. Wished I asked for the sauce on the side since the saucy half did lose its signature crunch and became soggy. All three sauces were very tasty. I especially enjoyed the carbonara (had a bit of unexpected heat) - be warned though, the sauce was heavy - can be overwhelming for someone to eat the entire tonkatsu on this sauce alone.

The restaurant exterior is dark and with a small R&D sign so you'll really need to look twice to find it. Once you enter the restaurant you get a great feel of openness and hospitality.

It was tasty but not something I'd order much of. $18.4) Crab Bimbimbap - R&D chili sauce, kimchi egg - a typical bimbimbap dish with small chunks of crab and egg.

So glad I did as it was the highlight of the night. I was hesitant because my boyfriend and I aren't the greatest fan of red beets but you can hardly taste it when mixed with the labneh which had the perfect consistency and creaminess. Served with some delicious barbari bread, this dish is one you don't want to pass up on. 5/5Crispy Squid ($13) - This one was a decent portion but the individual pieces of squid are very small. Lightly fried and the spices and garlic sauce (toum) give it a nice kick. Very flavorful dish overall and tasted great with our rice. Probably one of the least traditional items because frankly, it's basically calamari with some Eastern Mediterranean seasonings. But I wasn't there to judge (nor would I know) how authentic their food was, so 3.5/5 Turkish Manti Dumplings ($14) - I was looking forward to this the most but it ended up being the biggest disappointment of the night. Such a shame. The dumplings were underwhelming to say the least. I actually didn't even know they were filled with eggplant until the fourth one or so because the ones I ate prior had nothing in it. The molasses balanced the yogurt really well but other than that, nothing special. 2/5Tartufata ($30) - Probably the most expensive rice I've ever had.The truffle and mushrooms were decadent and the fried chick peas were amazing. Crispy and flavorful. The rice itself is very ordinary. So all things considered, I can't say it was completely worth it. I wouldn't order it again because I'd like to try their other rice offerings which looked and sounded just as appealing. 4/5Seared Cauliflower ($8) - It's considered to be a side so I'd recommend ordering this with one of their meat dishes (ribeye, lamb shoulder, etc.) because I think it'd compliment it quite well. We just thought cauliflower with duck fat sounded awesome so we couldn't resist and ordered it anyway. I prefer stronger flavors so I loved this but heads up it can be a bit heavy. 4/5As for dessert, we had the Loukmades ($12) - Fantastic! We were pretty full and while waiting, we kept negotiating how many bites each person would take to finish it. Ended up fighting over the last piece. Pretty much burnt honey icecream on a krispy kreme donut (but a different shape). So good and a must-order!! 5/5  Service was lackluster.  Our server was kind and filled our water pretty often but eventually disappeared. We found ourselves waiting a lot - to order dessert, to ask for the bill and to pay. Service shouldn't end after the customer finishes their main course but rather when they walk out the door. Also, typical of many high-end restaurants, they explain what's in every dish but it was spewed out so quickly that a lot of it was incoherent. Didn't really add any value to our dinner.  A little overhyped but I'd come back because their menu still has a few other interesting items I'd like to try. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone who's looking to celebrate a special occasion or somewhere nice to go for a first date. Just don't expect to be blown away.

I find the location to be very suspect. Although, it is located inside the hotel, the only way to have outside access is through the elevator that runs directly into the restaurant. If you were to enter through the hotel, you would have to go downstairs to the lower level where the meeting rooms are located and turn left and walk to one end of that level in order to find the entrance, which is preceded by a long hallway. Interestingly, the hostess station (and I say hostess station because I didn't see any hosts) faces the elevator entrance and not the hotel entrance, which is off to one side before the bar. The hostesses were attentive enough but not too bright, as I described the person that I was looking for to be in a bright red dress and they weren't sure. So, I proceeded to give the name under the reservation. They quickly took me to my table. The restaurant is quite dark and doesn't look like it has been renovated since the opening; however, this doesn't seem to be an issue, as everything seems very well appointed. The bar was quite cramped and there were a lot of people waiting inside. Although, it was only 6:30 pm, the restaurant was filled, so, if you are going, perhaps, a reservation would be in order. I'd hate to be cramped inside that little bar. The place is loud, so, if you are on your first date, this place may not be for you.As we were a large table, we were located on a stage type area with 2 seat tables lined up to infinity. I am not sure whether they had a table that was big enough to seat our entire group, but it didn't seem to be a problem. Even the people located on the wall had enough room to walk behind a seated person. Remember this point.It took the waiter awhile but eventually, he came by to insure that we had water. Drinks were not offered at this point. When my whole table arrived, many of us were surprised that the water wasn't filled sooner. When it came time to order, the waited tried to efficiently start from one side and go to the other; however, that side wasn't ready, so, he skipped to my wife and I, who were seated on the outside middle of the table. We ordered and I accidently placed my drink order and was surprised to find that the waiter was rude about it. He wasn't ready to take drink orders. By the time the orders were completed, the waited left to put in our order. It was at this point that we discovered that there was a kid's menu that NO ONE had told us about, including the waiter. So, we had to place a second order into the kitchen. The kid's menu comes with a main course, side, dessert and drink. Once again, the waiter was rude to me when I placed the drink order for the kids, telling me that I needed to wait, as he wasn't ready to take the drink orders. The meal came, and there seemed to be confusion over who had what. It was made worse, when the kid's orders came and the waiter didn't know who it went to. I saw no attempt for the waiter to try to get to the side with the wall, they just claimed that they would pass it over, as it was too far. The waiters also need re-training, as they would move their body between you and your meal and ask for forgiveness later, rather than asking before moving. I recognize that the meal is hot; however, this is no excuse for the lack of etiquette at this location.Needless to say, the meal was delicious.  Although, I said delicious, I didn't say it was right. Almost no one at the table got what they ordered in terms of how the steak was cooked, unless you had ordered it well done or medium rare. We didn't bother to send it back, but needless to say, we were disappointed. We were surprised that the kid's meals, which were about $23 each were SO LARGE! Then again, the price tag was high too. The chicken fingers came with 5 large chicken fingers and burnt fries. The children's filet came medium rare, she wanted it medium with tons of mashed potatoes. Someone ordered julienne fries, which turned out to be similar to hickory sticks. I ordered the steak fries and they were overcooked with one end on each burned. The mushrooms were well cooked. The $12 salad was large with fresh cheese, no side salads at this place.All in all, our total was over $1000. The starting price for a steak was $60, with the average price about $75. There are other things on the menu that aren't as pricey, such as the chicken, which was about $34. So, So overall, the waiter is rude, the food is undercooked, the prices are high.

I enjoyed eating the tater tots though they could be a bit more crispy and warm. Save yourself money and just head to Burger Priest or PnL for a quality burger that's probably cheaper.

It is quite a sizeable restaurant in the Distillery District and the decor and design of the restaurant is romantic and lovely, somewhat reminiscent of a bistro in Paris. The atmosphere is what potentially will draw me back to try brunch on the patio in the summer. However, the food unfortunately did not live up to the beauty of the restaurant itself.I would also like to note that despite the lovely display of various breads in the center of the restaurant, the bread served to our table was not as crunchy and soft as we expected. On the bread spectrum, it was more on the hard crust and dense interior side of breads, unlike what we would expect from a Paris bistro.We started with the salt cod donuts for an appetizer. It was served in the cutest little iron skillet with a side of smoked potato dipping sauce. The donuts had a thin crispy shell and a creamy inside similar to mashed potato. Despite being cod donuts, I could not really taste the cod, however they were pretty tasty overall with the creamy smoked potato dipping sauce. For main dishes, we had the hunter's stew with rabbit, pheasant sausage, and beef cheek and the veal meatball tomahawk, which was tomato braised and served with a side of gnocchi. The hunter's stew was served in a small bowl, with a side of mustard sauce and a flaky pastry bread. Although the meats were tender, the flavour was lacking depth and it was a forgettable dish except for the fact that it was quite small. The veal tomahawk was also tender, slightly better in flavour, and larger in portion. I enjoyed the side of gnocchi (garnished with parmesan and basil, to the best of my knowledge) better than the veal tomahawk itself. For dessert, we had the most disappointing praline profiteroles. Three profiteroles were beautifully plated, accompanied by chocolate chantilly, caramel crunch, hazelnut, and strawberry coulis. Unfortunately, the pastry itself was very hard and dense to the point that I had difficulty splitting the profiterole for a more manageable bite. The profiteroles were not very sweet but the delicate flavours were overpowered by the exceedingly sour strawberry coulis. The only part I enjoyed of dessert was the hazelnut and caramel crunch but I would not recommend this dessert.Honestly, I wish I could love this place based on concept and atmosphere alone, but the quality and taste of the dishes at Cluny did not reflect the price point.Overall rating: 2.5 stars ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2599, 2613)",1,0.0,False

It was served in the cutest little iron skillet with a side of smoked potato dipping sauce. The donuts had a thin crispy shell and a creamy inside similar to mashed potato. Despite being cod donuts, I could not really taste the cod, however they were pretty tasty overall with the creamy smoked potato dipping sauce. For main dishes, we had the hunter's stew with rabbit, pheasant sausage, and beef cheek and the veal meatball tomahawk, which was tomato braised and served with a side of gnocchi. The hunter's stew was served in a small bowl, with a side of mustard sauce and a flaky pastry bread. Although the meats were tender, the flavour was lacking depth and it was a forgettable dish except for the fact that it was quite small. The veal tomahawk was also tender, slightly better in flavour, and larger in portion. I enjoyed the side of gnocchi (garnished with parmesan and basil, to the best of my knowledge) better than the veal tomahawk itself. For dessert, we had the most disappointing praline profiteroles. Three profiteroles were beautifully plated, accompanied by chocolate chantilly, caramel crunch, hazelnut, and strawberry coulis. Unfortunately, the pastry itself was very hard and dense to the point that I had difficulty splitting the profiterole for a more manageable bite. The profiteroles were not very sweet but the delicate flavours were overpowered by the exceedingly sour strawberry coulis. The only part I enjoyed of dessert was the hazelnut and caramel crunch but I would not recommend this dessert.Honestly, I wish I could love this place based on concept and atmosphere alone, but the quality and taste of the dishes at Cluny did not reflect the price point.Overall rating: 2.5 stars ANSWERNOTFOUND",and hopefully better,"(70, 90)",5,0.5,False

The sashimi was definitely fresher than the ones I normally eat at AYCE restaurants, so I'm ok with paying a higher price for my meal, for $17.The sea urchin was interesting. I've never had sea urchin before so I decided to try some here.

You don't get a lot of quality Asian fusion places, especially ones that do sushi/sashimi with the same high standards as really good Japanese restaurants in the city.

I contemplated getting more of the torched salmon at regular prices, but I was too full by the end. 2) Bacon Wrapped Beef Tenderloin and Pan Seared Foie Gras Rouge - Not from the regular menu, this was a piece of Winterlicious originality. Everything on the plate tasted amazing, even the brussel sprouts. I can say for certain though that my first bite into the foie gras was the best, most orgasmic bite of the entire meal. It's also pure fatty goose liver goodness so even though you only get 3 small medallions of beef tenderloin, everything together made me quite full. 3) Green Tea Opera - (originally $14.5) - I was more than happy to see their signature dessert on the menu. It's really something special. Rich green tea mousse with crunchy hazelnuts. Served with a tiny scoop of fragrant house-made green tea ice cream. My fiancé had the Japanese Tiramisu. Tasty, but we both agreed the opera was better. Given the prices of the appetizer and dessert, that puts the beef and foie gras dish at $20! Sometimes, you can't even get a liver pâté dish at that price, let alone a whole piece of foie gras. On top of that, everything was cooked and flavoured to perfection.

Bonus: ask for a container to bring the soup home if you want to enjoy it with some rice for lunch the next day!3. the thai milk ice tea is preferred over the lemongrass ice tea since the lemongrass is so subtle that I could barely detect it next to the stronger flavour of the thai milk ice tea.Only small issue is the lack of coat hooks for the larger tables that use stools instead of chairs.  There is no convenient hook or coat stand nearby for guests at those tables.Till next time. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1441, 1455)",2,0.0,False

We checked out the noodle bar on the ground floor as well as the milk bar on the second floor. We did pop up to the third floor to check out what it looked like.I did a bit of research before coming and saw that the pork buns and momofuku ramen were a popular choice. And of course, we had to try the cereal milk and crack pie soft serve.The breakdown: Pork buns: really well seasoned, well cooked, delicious, BUT pretty fatty. Truthfully though, I am more than okay with a bit of extra fat because it was absolutely delightful. The burst of flavours really shook up my taste buds. Highly recommend. Momofuku ramen: Really well presented, flavours were on point for the first few bites and as a whole, the dish came through nicely. But once you start dissecting each piece of the dish, you'll find that the pork is a under-seasoned (nothing special about it, just tastes like meat), the egg was a little too raw for my liking, and the broth gets pretty salty. The reason why the dish comes together nicely is because the broth balances out the flavour of - or rather lack thereof - the pork. Overall, you could probably find a better bowl of ramen at a cheaper price elsewhere. Soft serve: You have to get it with the corn flakes. Get the full experience. The cereal milk flavoured soft serve reminded me a lot of the Horlicks drink I grew up on. It was... very interesting to say the least. I preferred the crack pie flavour. Feel like the soft serve here was a little overrated. Overall, tasted good, but my life has not changed. Milk bar upstairs: I bought the birthday truffles, a chocolate chocolate cookie and a blueberry and cream. Disclaimer: I have a crazy sweet tooth. Out of the three items I bought, I highly recommend the chocolate chocolate cookie. It's very soft and really hits the spot, but not in the way where you feel like your heart might explode from sweetness overload (although you should probably enjoy it with a glass of milk or something to tone down the sweetness if you find it too sweet). The atmosphere here was very interesting. Going from the first to the third was an experience in itself. I felt like I was going from a somewhat average area to a more upscale spot. Let me explain: the first floor almost looks like a picnic/caf area. The second floor has the milk bar and from what I remember, a small seating area (I could be wrong, I was too excited to go into the little milk bar shop area). The third floor looked really nice and classy, a nice place to go for a glass of wine maybe. Service was great. Our server, Michael, checked in on us every so often to make sure we were enjoying ourselves. He didn't overwhelm us with his presence though and we never felt rushed. I'd definitely come back for the pork buns and the milk bar. Jury is still out for whether or not I'd have another bowl of ramen + soft serve though. Cheers.

Overall, you could probably find a better bowl of ramen at a cheaper price elsewhere. Soft serve: You have to get it with the corn flakes. Get the full experience. The cereal milk flavoured soft serve reminded me a lot of the Horlicks drink I grew up on. It was... very interesting to say the least. I preferred the crack pie flavour. Feel like the soft serve here was a little overrated. Overall, tasted good, but my life has not changed. Milk bar upstairs: I bought the birthday truffles, a chocolate chocolate cookie and a blueberry and cream. Disclaimer: I have a crazy sweet tooth. Out of the three items I bought, I highly recommend the chocolate chocolate cookie. It's very soft and really hits the spot, but not in the way where you feel like your heart might explode from sweetness overload (although you should probably enjoy it with a glass of milk or something to tone down the sweetness if you find it too sweet). The atmosphere here was very interesting. Going from the first to the third was an experience in itself. I felt like I was going from a somewhat average area to a more upscale spot. Let me explain: the first floor almost looks like a picnic/caf area. The second floor has the milk bar and from what I remember, a small seating area (I could be wrong, I was too excited to go into the little milk bar shop area). The third floor looked really nice and classy, a nice place to go for a glass of wine maybe. Service was great. Our server, Michael, checked in on us every so often to make sure we were enjoying ourselves. He didn't overwhelm us with his presence though and we never felt rushed. I'd definitely come back for the pork buns and the milk bar. Jury is still out for whether or not I'd have another bowl of ramen + soft serve though. Cheers.

I got the Shoyu Ramen. Noodle: Al dente, bouncy.Broth: Amazing. I usually don't drink the broth but the Hokkaido's is so flavourful. Asked for less salt which was perfect. When you walk into the restaurant, the first thing that hits your nose is the smell of pork bones simmering away. You can also ask for less lard but why. Toppings: I love bamboo, glad it's included. I also had seaweed, slice of fish cake and green onion. Extra toppings are pricey (corn is $2.50, egg $1.80) which I didn't opt for. Chashu: Seems like I got the chashu scraps...got two small chunks of meat cut along the grain and a slab of pure fat. While it was tender, it was upon leaving the restaurant and seeing the display of noodles that my friends told me that they both got 2 regular slices of chashu. What the. Service: Friendly.

But our night didn't escalate that much after that...I asked for window seating in my reservation and was given a seat in the centre. We still had a view of Toronto but I wish they adhered to our seating preference, or at least notify us beforehand that there was none available for that moment. We were greeted by our waiter and he placed our napkins on our laps; I felt like a princess. The menu for the night:- White wine - Pinot grigio- Daily bread and chick pea spread - Coastal half dozen oysters- Rabbit saddle - Risoni risotto - Screeched tarte au sucre I appreciated how our server poured both my guest and myself some wine to taste. At other restaurants, typically only one guest would taste. As for food, I had everything besides the rabbit saddle. The bread was warm to touch with a firm crust. The spread reminded me of hummus - why don't they just call it hummus? It was nice how another server continued to bring us more bread while we were waiting for our mains, which did take a while to reach our table. Oysters were oysters - they tasted fresh.Risoni risotto - I enjoyed this a lot. It was different from other risotto dishes I've had as the rice was more flat and long. The risotto itself seemed to be loose. To explain, the rice would not stick together. However, I preferred this because it didn't make me feel like I was eating baby food. The kale crisps were divine - they were crunchy, thin, and added just enough texture compared to the star of the dish, the risotto. Screeched tarte au sucre - This reminded me of a creme brulee, but less sweet and less torched. Would have liked a bit more crunch on the top though!

But our night didn't escalate that much after that...I asked for window seating in my reservation and was given a seat in the centre. We still had a view of Toronto but I wish they adhered to our seating preference, or at least notify us beforehand that there was none available for that moment. We were greeted by our waiter and he placed our napkins on our laps; I felt like a princess. The menu for the night:- White wine - Pinot grigio- Daily bread and chick pea spread - Coastal half dozen oysters- Rabbit saddle - Risoni risotto - Screeched tarte au sucre I appreciated how our server poured both my guest and myself some wine to taste. At other restaurants, typically only one guest would taste. As for food, I had everything besides the rabbit saddle. The bread was warm to touch with a firm crust. The spread reminded me of hummus - why don't they just call it hummus? It was nice how another server continued to bring us more bread while we were waiting for our mains, which did take a while to reach our table. Oysters were oysters - they tasted fresh.Risoni risotto - I enjoyed this a lot. It was different from other risotto dishes I've had as the rice was more flat and long. The risotto itself seemed to be loose. To explain, the rice would not stick together. However, I preferred this because it didn't make me feel like I was eating baby food. The kale crisps were divine - they were crunchy, thin, and added just enough texture compared to the star of the dish, the risotto. Screeched tarte au sucre - This reminded me of a creme brulee, but less sweet and less torched. Would have liked a bit more crunch on the top though! The crust tasted slightly undercooked but overall, good flavours in the dessert.One thing that would've made my experience better is having the menus labelled for persons with dietary restrictions.

Interesting decor with upbeat music playing in the background. Not a fan of dimly lit restaurants. I know it's supposed to set the mood but it only makes me sleepy lol. I sat at one of the tables with bar stools and it wasn't very comfortable. There are hooks on the side of the table to hook your bags and jackets to but I think it would have been better to have hooks on the walls for jackets. Weren't a lot of hooks and if you were wearing a long coat, it'll drag on the ground. My friends got the Khao pla tawt (fish) and Khao soi, and I got the ox tail. No complaints about the fish and the only thing my friend had to say about the khao soi was that it was a little too creamy for her but if that's your thing then give it a try. I enjoyed my ox tail dish very much! The sauce was amazing and there was more meat than I expected. Meat was fall off the bone so very very tender. Haven't tried anything else there but definitely planning to!It's a nice touch that they added the Wi-Fi password and network on the menu but unfortunately, it didn't work when I was there (Dec 15).

Tables were all occupied, but we were still able to find a spot by the bar to gather around. Plenty of space in the restaurant I noticed for big groups if you're able to come at a good time to grab a table. Good selection of beers on tap, and menu seemed like there were a lot of comfort food type options. Some of what we ordered  were sweet potato chips and calamari. Chips were good, calamari was less than average. My friend's chicken wrap was good as I was told. Food was brought out with good timing, and drinks the same way. Service was average and as expected from being at a casual restaurant. The only annoyance of our experience at C'est What was with one of male bartenders that served us occasionally.

The food was placed in small independent bowls and they fit nicely on a wooden plate. A lot of my co-workers say that this place has one of the best a la carte in Toronto and I can agree. There were some pieces of fish that I didn't enjoy but I generally enjoyed it. I especially like the fried shrimp but they only give 1 :(Great service at this restaurant. The place itself looked very classy and everybody there was well dressed, while I was proudly enjoying my meal in my jeans and sweater on the other hand.In terms of value, I paid around 40 dollars for the meal. Just to warn you beforehand, if you are a short average looking male, this meal will definitely not fill you up. I went during lunch time too so I can't begin to imagine how much this would cost at dinner.Overall, the food here is a good try but I don't see myself coming back. The amount of food I recieved was way too little for the amount that I paid for. And that's it for today's episode of javing it with Javier. And remember food is life!

The neon blue sign is almost illegible! I came by myself after a coworker had suggested it and ate at the bar.  No, it wasn't awkward like some places can be when you eat by yourself.I was pleased to notice that all the workers in the kitchen were of Asian descent - not sure if they were Thai, but it's a start towards authenticity, I guess.  All the waitresses were chatting away in Thai as well.  I ordered a Thai tea to start - I noticed that they actually use condensed milk in their Thai teas, making for a much sweeter and thicker tea than I would prefer.

The fried egg on top was very crispy and well done while keeping the egg yolk still tender, and overall, the fried rice wasn't too overly flavoured.

We looked and nothing was available.. Busy Wednesday.. So instead we said we'd finish our drinks and leave. She started arguing, yes arguing and told us, move, I have a table wanting to sit here.. Yup, we were still sat. We had no problem moving for her friends, however the manner In which it was done was crass and terrible service. She was not friendly or accommodating. We are two dudes on a night out after finishing work at our bar, looking for a pint. Not a couple on a date wanting to be sat in the restaurant section. She was rude and this resulted in us leaving without any intention to return. Real shame and queen st need to sort out this clear error in recruitment. Maybe she should be put in training at the bloor st location or just learn manners. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1601, 1615)",1,0.0,False

However, the service fucking sucks. First time I came here was for drinks - we were told it would be a fifteen minute wait. Forty five minutes later, we're seated finally at a table (with a fucking hole in the middle. Some kind of repurposed plank of wood with actual gouges in it that go clear through the table. I narrowly avoid dropping my beer through the hole multiple times throughout the night). I digress, after our drinks we order a bill each and the server gives three out of five of my friends the wrong bill. After they point it out, she gets all flustered and angry and starts fiddling with the receipt machine and it breaks, apparently. She says she can't remember what we ordered and my friends proceed to tell her what they ordered and what the price was. She ignores them and goes, well .... let's just say it was $15. Most of them had only ordered a single beer, so they were like .. no? By that point though, we just wanted to leave so they paid the bill and we left. Next visit was in the summer and the place was nearly empty inside, we request a patio seat and the server goes I'll check if there are tables available and leaves. Ten minutes go by and we're still waiting at the front, a couple comes in behind us and a male server seats them, ignoring us. Then he comes back and asks if we've been taken care of. We're like ... uhh yeah, I think so. We're waiting on a patio seat. He just nods and goes to take care of his tables. Then another five minutes go by and we flag him down and tell him our hostess never returned and we'd like to be seated. He seats us on the patio next to a giant pipe sticking out of the wall. It's flush to our table and MY seat, so I'm forced to accommodate this awkward fucking pipe that's pressing into my arm. Rest of the meal was uneventful but I haven't returned. I have heard some awful stories about the behaviour of the bartenders, hitting on girls at the bar during their shift and giving them extra special attention while ignoring everyone else.

After they point it out, she gets all flustered and angry and starts fiddling with the receipt machine and it breaks, apparently. She says she can't remember what we ordered and my friends proceed to tell her what they ordered and what the price was. She ignores them and goes, well .... let's just say it was $15. Most of them had only ordered a single beer, so they were like .. no? By that point though, we just wanted to leave so they paid the bill and we left. Next visit was in the summer and the place was nearly empty inside, we request a patio seat and the server goes I'll check if there are tables available and leaves. Ten minutes go by and we're still waiting at the front, a couple comes in behind us and a male server seats them, ignoring us. Then he comes back and asks if we've been taken care of. We're like ... uhh yeah, I think so. We're waiting on a patio seat. He just nods and goes to take care of his tables. Then another five minutes go by and we flag him down and tell him our hostess never returned and we'd like to be seated. He seats us on the patio next to a giant pipe sticking out of the wall. It's flush to our table and MY seat, so I'm forced to accommodate this awkward fucking pipe that's pressing into my arm. Rest of the meal was uneventful but I haven't returned. I have heard some awful stories about the behaviour of the bartenders, hitting on girls at the bar during their shift and giving them extra special attention while ignoring everyone else. Also heard a story about a bartenders general sliminess towards a middle aged couple and it made me physically sick.Their chain also employs a transphobic, verbally abusive social media team. Seeing this restaurant headline in a Buzzfeed article for posting a transphobic instagram image and responding to backlash like 5-year-olds was the last straw.My final verdict: garbage trash establishment. You couldn't pay me to step foot in here again. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2826, 2840)",1,0.0,False

Convenient location, efficient customer service, clean and spacious atmosphere, and most importantly - good food. Although the broth might not be as rich as that of Kinton or Sansotei, which might be the only downfall, the food quality is nothing less than these two. Ramen was nice and chewy (portion size may be a wee bit smaller than usuals). You also don't get to 'customize' your noodles or broth as they are pretty set on what's on the menu. What you see on their menu is what you're gonna get (maybe you'll get to add an extra egg or two, for extra of course).Seating for Japanese places are in general smaller, and although this is no different for this restaurant, you do get a bit more arm space between the next table. As opposed to Kinton and Sansotei which tend to have a darker decor (literally), this place is pretty bright with natural lighting (glasses all on one side of the wall) and a bigger lot, which I personally like, especially in good weather.Presentation of the food is also quite nice.

Make reservations. Since it opened, this place has gotten great buzz for providing authentic, flavourful Thai food. As a result, people from all over the city have been flocking to this casual downtown joint for lunch and dinner. (They also do take out orders.) My friend and I arrived at 6pm on a Thursday and the place was already almost full: tables of two and four, plus the larger tables at the front that could be utilized for larger parties or cafeteria-style seating and the bar were occupied by a mix of couples, friends and colleagues from the surrounding businesses. While we waited to be seated, I noticed a sheet of laminated paper at the host's stand imploring potential, hungry customers to be patient while waiting for a table to become available.2. Come hungry. Portions are more than reasonable and priced accordingly. We were starving and decided to try a number of dishes and split them between us: cold rolls filled with home-made chicken sausage, lettuce, carrots, mint leaves and Thai basil (Po Pia Pak Sod Gai Yaw); crispy squash fritters (Gra Bong); a curry dish with bell and hot peppers, kaffir lime leaves and the ubiquitous Thai basil (Gaeng Panang); pad Thai; and a house specialty of stir-fried minced beef with holy basil, topped with a fried egg (Pad Gra Pra). We also ordered the only beer available, Singha. Not entirely sure why there is only one, but it's a light, refreshing beer and I had no complaints about it.3. Temper your expectations. The food at Khao San Road is good, yes,but it was not exemplary. It wasn't bad by any means, but I had very high expectations that were sadly unmet. The exception was the Pad Gra Pra which was very, very good. It's a house specialty so if you go, you might be best to stick with the items on that particular part of the menu. There was nothing wrong with the food in particular; however, after hearing such glowing reviews from both friends and reviews, I was anticipating more.Additionally, we found the service lacking. Our order was taken promptly and our first round of drinks appeared in short order. The problems started when food began to arrive at our fairly small table faster than we could eat.

Once we had all our food, our server disappeared, a problem on two fronts: we had no room to maneuver and we wanted another round of Singhas. We were able to flag her down eventually and we were served with much reluctance from that point.Khao San Road is not a bad restaurant by any stretch. The food is better than average but not spectacular. Stick with the house specialties and you'll likely do well. If you're going to go in for a sit-down meal, reservations are a must.

On a Friday afternoon with nothing to do, I decided to line up for Uncle Tetsu's because I figured the afternoon line would be shorter than the lineup after work hours. I got in line at around 1:50 PM and I think by the time I left it was around 3:20, so about an hour and a half wait. I think I chose a pretty good time too, because later on the line just got longer and longer.I bought a cheesecake and also four madeleines, for a total of $17.56. Everything is baked fresh, so the cake and madeleines were warm when I first got them and still slightly warm by the time I got home like an hour later. I tried the cheesecake first when it was warm and fresh, and then later on in the evening after I had chilled it, and I definitely preferred it chilled. When it was warm and fresh, the cake was hard to cut, and the slice pretty much fell apart when I transferred it onto my plate. It therefore did not feel like I was eating cake, more kind of like this weird, fluffy custard texture... not a fan. The taste was light though and I didn't mind it, but the texture threw me off because it felt all weird and bubbly and airy. After chilling, the cake solidified so that it actually resembled a cake a lot more. It's like this perfect texture in-between the rich creaminess of an American cheesecake and the light fluffiness of a sponge cake. Quite honestly I've never had anything like it, and I thoroughly enjoyed it! The flavour was also just as light, you can kind of taste a light cheesiness but it is not overwhelming. The madeleines were not quite as interesting, but they were quite tasty nonetheless when they were fresh and warm, and I mean you might as well try them after standing in line for so long.As for the million dollar question: was it worth the wait? Honestly I really did enjoy the cheesecake, and I didn't even mind the lineup so much despite the fact that I waited alone. It got a little bit chilly and drizzled a little on the particular day I went, so that was a bit rough, but I've had worse experiences (i.e. waiting 7 hours in the winter for a $20 Rob Ford bobblehead...) so this was nothing in comparison.

We were here for a work friend's birthday group of 8 or 9. We ordered drinks and food and it was all delivered with speed and accuracy, considering it was a busy Friday night. The food was great. I ordered a burger and fries. My sister ordered a chicken flatbread.My second experience, left me a bit unsatiated, as we left without eating. We were there for the RedPath Waterfront Festival at Sugar Beach and wanted to have a sit down meal. Our group of 5 asked for seats on the patio, at around 7:45 pm. We were given pagers and were told the wait would be about 45 minutes. We expected that, so we walked up and down the lakeshore. We were finally seated at about 8:30 and ordered food and drinks right away. At 9:30, we still hadn't received our food. It's not like we ordered huge meals, we ordered two flatbreads, a salad to share, and shrimp something. We flagged down our waitress, and she informed us that we would have to wait ANOTHER 20 MINUTES. We had somewhere to be at 10, so we said forget the food, bring us our drink bill. The manager came out and apologized for the wait, he explained a large party had come in and unexpectedly backed up the kitchen. He took care of our drink bill and gave us a $25 gift card to come back again.

The first time being the end of May. The weather was beautiful for a late Friday night. The patio was busy (as usual) but the ambience and service was good. We were here for a work friend's birthday group of 8 or 9. We ordered drinks and food and it was all delivered with speed and accuracy, considering it was a busy Friday night. The food was great. I ordered a burger and fries. My sister ordered a chicken flatbread.My second experience, left me a bit unsatiated, as we left without eating. We were there for the RedPath Waterfront Festival at Sugar Beach and wanted to have a sit down meal. Our group of 5 asked for seats on the patio, at around 7:45 pm. We were given pagers and were told the wait would be about 45 minutes. We expected that, so we walked up and down the lakeshore. We were finally seated at about 8:30 and ordered food and drinks right away. At 9:30, we still hadn't received our food. It's not like we ordered huge meals, we ordered two flatbreads, a salad to share, and shrimp something. We flagged down our waitress, and she informed us that we would have to wait ANOTHER 20 MINUTES. We had somewhere to be at 10, so we said forget the food, bring us our drink bill. The manager came out and apologized for the wait, he explained a large party had come in and unexpectedly backed up the kitchen. He took care of our drink bill and gave us a $25 gift card to come back again.

I would order the chicken tacos again. (Be warned! Some of the table sauces are quite spicy!)3. If you like guacamole, you will love their chips and guacamole. The chips, which can be a tinge greasy, are tasty and made in house.4. The service, aside from being a bit rushed, was good. The recommendations for food and drinks were perfect.5. The vibe is loud and fun. I noticed that there was quite a diverse crowd here, which is nice as well.6. They have indoor and outdoor seating.
