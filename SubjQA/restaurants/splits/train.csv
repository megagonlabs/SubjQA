Although there was a line, I got seated immediately by the bar since I was dining alone.The place is very noisy as most of the other reviews indicated.  The menu is surprisingly short for an izakaya (at least from my experience in NYC).My favorite dishes were the kinoko cheese bibimbap and the tori karaage.The kinoko cheese bibimbap was rice served in a sizzling stone pot, mixed with chunky pieces of garlic-sauteed mushrooms, shredded cheese and a super tasty sauce made of seaweed.  It's such a simple but brilliant dish.  Really appetizing and extremely delicious.  The tori karaage was truly succulent and fried to perfection.  They use dark meat chicken and the chunks of chicken were very well marinated.The tontoro (grilled pork cheeks) were at first ordinary but then I tasted them with the tiny smudge of yuzu-flavored wasabi/mustard and it was brought to a whole new level.  Such an interesting combination!The ebi mayo was the biggest disappointment.  Although the shrimp used were fresh, they had too much batter and ended up tasting very ordinary, even with the spicy mayo dressing.For dessert, I tried the almond cream.  That was a great way to end a heavy meal.  It was like almond-flavored jello.  Not that creamy as it claims on the menu.  But good nonetheless.Would definitely come back again.

Walking down Parliament street we totally missed this restaurant and had to back track to find it. It's actually located in the basement but there were street level signs.Stepping inside it was very under whelming. Without all these positive yelp reviews and my desire to indulge in there famous jerk chicken I may have just turned around and left. The restaurant is really dated with old school wood panelled walls, tiny rickety cafeteria tables, and matching wood panelled banquets with saggy pinstriped cushions.Before I had chance to consult with my hubby of our intentions of staying or leaving our lovely waitress Kim warmly welcomed us and told us to grab a seat anywhere. It was just past 4pm and the restaurant although tiny had about 8 other guests dining. We took a seat against the banquet beside the bar at a corner table. I have to admit the seats were a bit uncomfortable as the wood panelled banquets were awkwardly angled at least they had some sort of cushion and the small table seemed to be at awkward height as well but nothing I couldn't manage. Kim came back and delivered us the menus, informed us of the specials, and brought us a pitcher of ice water with sliced cucumbers inside which was a nice touch. They also have daily specials that change all the time but we both knew what we wanted the jerk chicken dinners. We asked to sub the jasmine rice that it comes with for peas and rice and Kim said no problem. I thought there would be an extra cost to do that but surprisingly there wasn't. Kim asked if we like our jerk chicken spicy or mild and we both wanted spicy. She also explained that they grill the chicken made to order so it may take a while. We were both cool with that as hearing our food was not precooked and being made fresh for us was another bonus.Kim was really nice and chatted with us and keep us posted on the status of meals. What was also nice to see was as guests came in you could see that they were all regulars as she greeted them by name and had there drink orders memorized.When our meal finally arrived I was in heaven. After that first bite of chicken I knew why there were soo many regulars and why it was so raved about. Seriously some the best jerk chicken i've ever had! The chicken itself was soo juicy and tender, seasoning was perfect, nice grill flavour, and the heat was good without being too much. What I also loved about this chicken was it was all boneless chicken, mostly thigh meat, and not saucy so you get that nice dry jerk seasoning through the moist tender meat. The meal also came served with a garden salad and homemade coleslaw. Normally I hate coleslaw but this one was pretty good, not too creamy and it had a nice tangy sweet and sour flavour. The peas and rice were also really good and the hidden gem in this dish was the bit of oxtail gravy over the rice and a little piece of oxtail with bone. The oxtail was also amazing, so tender and flavourful you could tell they really stewed it well. It was such a nice surprise to find it under the chicken but such a tease because it was soo good it made me want more.At the end of our meal we were highly satisfied. The portion was ample with lots meat and we definitely fulfilled our jerk chicken craving. This restaurant is also really affordable I think our meal was $11 each which I thought was a total steal! Fresh, flavourful food and a waitress that's soo warm and welcoming you can totally see why so many people keep coming back here. I will definitely be returning to get my jerk chicken fix and to try the oxtail dinner! ANSWERNOTFOUND",$ 11,"(3420, 3423)",5,0.0,False

The restaurant was dimly lit with rustic lighting and candles, which were a lovely touch. The tables were wooden, and again, went with that rustic feel. Everything was just amazing. I think I'm doing a horrible job at describing this place and I'm not doing it any justice, so just pay them a visit.Second, and the most important, was the food. I needed to be wheeled out of here when I was done. Here's a rundown of what we ordered:-Fresh Mozzarella with Pingue Prosciutto: the crostinis were really good, as was the fig jam, sea salt, proscuitto and the cheese of course. We also asked for a side of the tomato jam which went well with the cheese. I suggest spreading some fig jam on the crostini, sprinkling some sea salt on it, then topping it off with some cheese. It was sooo good!-Straight up meatball: We just had the classic meatball. I'm not a huge fan of beef or any type of ground up meat, but this meatball was delicious! It was doused in tomato sauce and cheese and sat atop a piece of bread... it was just so good-Bianca Pizza: I thought this pizza was really good... and it was... until about a few slices in. This pizza, in theory, is really yummy- the caramelized onions add a bit of sweetness and the tomatoes, a bit of tang, but the herbs and overkill of parmesan cheese made it just a slight bit too salty for my friends' and I's liking.Sidenote: We let the waitress know when she asked us how we liked the food and she was nice enough to take the pizza off the bill... Grade A customer service.-Chocolate panna cotta: I really wanted to love this, and I did love it for a few bites, until the balsamic flavor became too much to handle. The chocolate of the panna cotta was done well- it wasn't too sweet and it wasn't dull, but the balsamic flavor became very overpowering after a few bites. It added a nice tang in the beginning, but after, that's all you seem to taste.-Tiramisu: delicious... simply delicious. The espresso flavor really came through on this one-Zeppole: Yum! Who doesn't like dough balls and chocolate?-Blood orange and cucumber mojito: mojito done to the next level. It's a regular mojito that tastes so much better than a regular mojito. Sooo good. I will never drink regular mojitos again.Overall, I had an awesome time here. Our waitress was amazing. She gave us tons of suggestions and was very knowledgable about the menu. All of the staff members who came by our table were really nice and friendly- especially the hostess who stood by the door and brought us over to our table. I will, most definitely, be back for another visit. Everything was great! P.S. We were told by our waitress that there is a live DJ on Thurs, Fri, and Sat nights! and $7 cocktails and $5 pints!

Wow - I am still salivating at the memory of my meal here. Now let me start this by saying that I don't particularly enjoy beef - seriously, I just don't. But my friends really wanted me to come here with them because they were sure this would be the place to finally convert me to the pleasures of eating red meat - particularly steak. So I agreed in joining them here for dinner. The hostess showed us to our table and proceeded to explain to us how things work. Basically, there is a salad buffet at the back of the restaurant that has a variety of things like: mashed potatoes, sauteed veggies, fried cassava root, fresh salads, olives, bread, soup, etc,etc,etc..... After you have filled your plate with whatever catches your eye, you proceed to your seat and wait for the very hunky gauchos to bring you unlimited amounts of delicious meat. And you get to check them out while they do this - just make sure your date doesn't catch you (mine did) as this can make things a bit uncomfortable.... Anyway, I tried a large variety of meats including seasoned flank steak, pork loin, Parmesan chicken thighs, fillet Mignon, bacon wrapped fillet Mignon, peppery BBQ ribs, salmon, lamb, steak with cheese, suckling pig, homemade sausages, etc.... so much meat I can't even remember it all. There is a little menu card on the table, and if you see something on there that you'd like to try but haven't, just ask the next gaucho that comes around and they will bring it to you. Oh - and make sure to have the grilled pineapple, not only is it sweet and delicious, but it will aide you in digesting all those massive amounts of meat. Service here was great - all the servers were super friendly and accommodating, and our drinks were refilled continuously. We came on a Friday night, and they have live entertainment. A Brazilian band plus Samba dancers and Capoeira performers. They only have these on weekends, so I guess that's the best time to check this place out. Oh and if you get caught checking out your cute gaucho, fret not. Your date can check out the skimpy dressed Samba dancers and make things even :) Definitely a place worth checking out at least once, but I enjoyed it so much that we are returning in a couple of weeks.

We were running late but they had us seated right away. First, we looked at the rather limited cocktail menu and apprehensively ordered some of those expensive cocktails. We were so glad that they turned out to be so good (got our money's worth). I think their bartender recently won some competition and he truly knows his craft. We ordered a bunch of food items from the menu (mostly appetizers). Unfortunately for us they all came out in a hurry which was a slight blemish on the part of our server. We requested that they send some dishes back to the kitchen since we were not ready to take it all in at the same time and they obliged. Our server was very well informed and also stopped by our table to inquire about the dish we were served. Our favorite bites of the night were the oyster po'boy sliders (why are they so tiny?) and the octopus. The octopus is a complex dish but I loved the combination of the harissa and salsa verde (perfect for my palate). The king crab rosti was nothing memorable and it left a sour after taste. Moreover, for 32 bucks I would consider it rather expensive for what it's worth. We also ordered a side of skinny fries (highly recommended even if you are on a diet :)) which we really enjoyed dipping in some herbacious aioli. For dessert we had the angel food cake with burnt marshmallow crust which was very light and fluffy. Overall, this place has an upscale yet casual vibe.

Firstly, one of my friends always raves about their coconut cream pie, and I wanted to see if it lived up to all that hype. And secondly, restaurant was running a $62 three-course Lobsterlicious special and I just can't seem to resist these prix fixe menus. Three types of bread were served, and I had one of each. One small complaint was that the butter was really hard to spread onto the bread.The bread basket was quickly followed by a complimentary amuse bouche: prosciutto with winter lettuce, toasted pine nuts, tarragon relish and Meyer lemon aioli. Everything tasted pretty good together, but it didn't wow me.Here are my picks for the Lobsterlicious menu:My choice of starter was the Dungeness crab ravioli with mustard greens, bok choy, radish and a uni butter sauce. The bok choy made the overall dish feel very Asian. The single raviolo was packed with crab meat, and the uni butter sauce was absolutely scrumptious. After demolishing everything else on the plate, I soaked up all the remaining sauce with bread. For my main, I opted for lobster gnocchi. Oddly enough, I loved everything in my lobster gnocchi that was not lobster- the snap peas, carrots, pearl onions, beet, and herb gnocchi! The vegetables were bright and vibrant, and I especially enjoyed the sweet beets. On top of that, the gnocchi was absolutely lovely, as light as a pillow. I also thought that the presentation was stunning with all the colourful veggies. My gnocchi was accompanied with a Parisienne lobster thermidor sauce, topped with toasted bread crumbs and gruyère cheese. On paper, this was everything that I should love- rich, cheesy lobster sauce topped with bread crumbs and cheese. Every spoonful contained large chunks of lobster meat. I couldn't believe that I could ever have too much lobster, but this was the case for me! Everything was so rich.For desserts, I went with the Araguani chocolate mousse with earl grey ice cream, lemon curd, honey tangerines and blood orange reduction. Clearly, I don't know my chocolate well, because Araguani is a 72% cocoa dark chocolate bar made by Valrhona, one of best chocolatiers in the world. I think the mousse was a misnomer, because it was more like a dark chocolate bar filled with chocolate mousse. As expected, it was too dark for my liking, although the earl grey ice cream was amazing!Here's what my bf ordered:Lobster bisque to start. The soup was topped with armagnac cream and chives. For me, the soup was intensely rich, and the armagnac on top of that was overwhelming. I was slightly put off by so much alcohol in the soup.8 oz filet mignon with porcini whipped potatoes, wild mushrooms, French green beans and Bordelaise sauce. I particularly loved the whipped potatoes, which packed an incredible punch of mushroom flavour. The steak was also executed very well. For desserts, he ordered Scaramouche's famous coconut cream pie with white chocolate shavings and dark chocolate sauce. This was like heaven in a slice of pie! Even though it was impossibly decadent and rich, I just couldn't stop taking more and more bites! The white chocolate and coconut were such a great pairing, and the pie crust was perfectly flaky and delicate. Not great for the waistline, but it was so phenomenal that it was almost worth every calorie!Who says you can't get full from fine dining? I was absolutely stuffed at the end of the meal! It was definitely a memorable experience, but I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon. After all, it was one of the most expensive meals that I've ever eaten, and I can't justify the price despite the generally positive experience.

I had always ordered a couple of staples, which were cooked reasonably well and filled the void in my stomach.However (and this is a big however), I have since lowered them to 1 star. If I could give them no stars, I would. I eat here fairly frequently, at least once sometimes twice a month and I don't even live in Toronto. Last month I ordered the soup and sandwich deal and was told the soup of the day was either tomato chickpea and cream of broccoli. I usually quite enjoy their cream of broccoli soup, but what I was served (both taste and texture) was more like a wilted old lettuce soup. It was disgusting. I kept trying to eat it, thinking to myself - there's something wrong with this soup. My mother-in-law was the first to pipe up to our waitress about it (whom we tried to track down for a good 10 minutes because no one ever checks on their tables there). There's something wrong with the soup, I tell her. Oh, no there's nothing wrong with it - it's actually asparagus soup and I just forgot to tell you. Exact words. Not paraphrasing. It was disgusting. I was brought the dreadful tasting tomato chickpea soup instead and just couldn't bring myself to finish it.And this is just the beginning because - wait - there's more. Last week I went in again and decided to order the Phad Thai. Big mistake. I have had the dish before both there as well as from many other restaurants in the Greater Toronto area and have always quite liked the dish.  The dish had two pictures of chilli peppers next to it, which most restaurants have despite the dish being more sweet than it is spicy. I took a bit of it and almost threw up. There was no flavour there - it was just spice. I complained to the waitress who at first gave me a bit of attitude but said I could order something else. I had a strange feeling so I said Are you planning on charging me for this food I can't eat?. Of course I am, there's nothing wrong with it. She replies haughtily. I tried to explain that it was beyond hot and that it was nearly impossible to eat. It's not normally like this. Well that's not our fault, its yours because you didn't read the menu. I was aghast and she even brought the menu over to point out the two chilli peppers. She was beyond being explained to and was at a point where she was arguing with me, not letting me speak and telling me that it was my fault.She kept telling me I had to pay for a meal that was inedible even by the poorest of standards so I ended up walking out. I had at one point even asked to speak to the owner or manager. She actually smiled at me, crossed her arms and said they weren't in that day. She said she was in charge and that's just the way things are.I have never been treated so rudely at a restaurant before in my life. Yes, the prices are good and the servings are large - but the service is gawd awful to the point where they should be reported to the Better Business Bureau. The atmosphere is tolerable on some days and  rank the next - the music being the most obvious culprit. With no standards as to what can and will be played you can be tortured with just about anything your nightmares can come up with - and mid lunch, I just don't want to hear a skipping CD of some woman who is swinging a cat by the tail to drums when all I want to do is listen to the person across the table from me tell me a story.For the average student this place may be fine as long as you never have a complaint and stick to the same meal each time. Never complain because it's the customers fault, not the kitchens. Bring some ear plugs or your MP3 player and last but not least, shut up and eat the food they give you....or else....or else you can just skip it altogether. Probably your best plan of action.

Despite all the warnings about the ambiance, it still shocked me. I personally enjoyed the atmosphere and the lively energy but big mistake in bringing me dad here. He absolutely hated the noise. Now guu actually takes reservations now, and we came in on reservation. But even with a reservation, they seated us at the bar. I might have been okay with this If I was with a friend, but since I was with my family , it was disappointing that we couldn't face eachother and talk. We saw empty tables but the guy said they were reserved an for 6 people, however, when we saw people come, there were only groups of three, so....not very happy with the seating arrangement.Now for the food. We ordered quite a lot, I actually planned to spend around 60 but with some add ons, it ended up over 100 for 3 people. So for the food, we started off with takowasabi, it was super fresh and extremely strong wasabi. I liked it but only had one bite cause of the strong wasabi. Next came the tuna sashimi which was amazing. Other favourites include the ebishrimp, the ikapiri, the mushroom udon, and the kakimayo. The worst dish was the tontoro, which was overcooked and had to be spit out because it was so tough you couldnt swallow it.Overall, I liked the experience and would return to try more of the menu! Ps. They are extremely busy and not very organized. Our food came out fast then extremely slow. Also one of the waiters delivered the wrong bibimbap which he had also mixed up so it was too late. But the people were very happy and nice. I would consider going again only during down time or maybe on like a slower day ANSWERNOTFOUND",celebrate,"(41, 50)",2,0.0,False

I'd heard amazing things about them from NYC.   Not sure I would return.  The food was okay, way better gyro in the area for much better price.My biggest issue was the staff, I get how it's busy and you only make minimum wage but the majority of the staff looked like they hated life.  There was a short line but only because the staff couldn't move slower.  I grew up in restaurants and I never would have hired the majority of these people.I got my food to go, had to tell the person three times.  Cutlery by the fountain pop was totally empty, had to tell the cashier more was needed, ordered a fountain and and had to ask for the cup.  Where is the Manager????  Is no one interested in the client experience?  My guess is the manager was doing some menial job in the back.These sad people couldn't wait to leave, and it was only dinner time.   To offer an area to improve, it is in management.  All these issues relate to having very low quality or inexperienced managers.Managers, get involved.  Talk to your guests, get involved in the dining experience and train your people or this will be a short stay in Toronto.After the very poor experience I had originally i decided to give it another shot.  It seemed more organized.  But still lots of staff not focussed on customers but focussed on random conversations between themselves.  I don't mind waiting in line if the staff are working on fulfilling the customers orders but for over 5 minutes there were 9 of us in line and the staff was not taking any orders they were fulfilling the web orders.  That seems totally counter intuitive, the people who come to your restaurant get less prompt service than the customers who stay home.  If your web orders are going is well create a station where you fulfill those but give the customers priority service if they walk into your restaurant.I hope they figure it out but judging by my continued experience with very low customer service I don't have much hope.  This sort of service issue starts with the managers and boss figuring out what they want to offer their customers.  At this point I'd say the are making poor decisions.

The soup that came with the omakase was a lot less than the first time I've been here. The soup was incredibly salty and tasted a bit grainy. Next, when the Yuzu roll came, the fire was admittedly superb, and the taste was good.Next, the omakase. The biggest disappointment. I am not a sushi connoisseur, so I can't attest that I know what each piece was and what the specific type of fish used was. However, some of the 18 pieces seemed to be copies of each other. What is the point of an omakase if it does not even have 18 unique pieces on the plate? Not worth the money. The variety was not good, but the taste was. My boyfriend seemed to really enjoy it, which was the point of coming here.The spider roll was fine. Not plated great for the price, so the aesthetics had a lot to be desired. The avocado was creamy inside and melted in my mouth.The taste was good for the dishes ordered, but the omakase felt like they were ripping me off from my experience and my money. Service: Service was terrible, terrible, terrible. Once I was done my tea, there were no refills or anything for a little while. In fact, I did not see the waitresses doing anything, except the bare minimum of giving our food. There was nobody going around refilling the tea, despite it being a full house. A few times, I saw them talking to each other because there was nothing to do. At least they gave the food for us.... The table of three beside me who came before my table did not get food. During the middle of our meal, they actually all got up and left. The lead waitress, who I assume is one of the owners tried pleading with them and sort of followed them out the door. Awkward... Just another reason why service wasn't that great. Tip to the servers: If a table hasn't gotten their food while all the other tables have, maybe go up to them or the chefs to follow up? Yeah?As soon as we were done eating, the servers really went into action and cleared our plates and seemed to have an aura surrounding them that said, Leave! Now!

They are unlike anything I'd ever tasted, and the sweet and sour sauce they serve with it really elevated things to the next level.

The chicken was delicious and there were no weird pieces- which is very important to me : )Khao Soi: It's no wonder this is one of their signature dishes. We ordered it with beef at the recommendation of our server and were not disappointed. The beef was obviously slow cooked, and was so tender that it fell apart on our forks. The rich curry sauce was like heaven.I would definitely recommend ordering multiple items and sharing. Each dish is so flavorful and rich that it's nice to be able to have some variety. Our bill for the above dishes plus 2 drinks was about $50. Not bad, considering we took enough food home to have it again for dinner the next night.

The po pia are fresh rolls filled with home-made chicken sausage, lettuce, carrots, mint leaves, and Thai basil. A tamarind-garlic sauce topped with peanuts and Thai coriander is on the side for dipping. The chicken sausage is springy and the vegetables serve to give a nice crunch and faint sweetness to the roll. Fresh and tasty, this is a light way to start your meal.Accompanying my starter was the Thai iced tea. Infused with Thai spices, this is a sweet and creamy drink made with condensed milk. The tea they use is strong - almost herbal - and it reminds me of my mother's Ceylon tea that she loves so much. Not so light, but delicious and cooling. I sipped it happily, reminded of visits to Malaysia.Gra bong are squash fritters made of deep-fried squash with red curry paste, shrimp paste, lemongrass and eggs. Like the onion bhaji, a lot of people seem to love this. Also like the onion bhaji, I am not one of those lovers. They're crispy, a little chewy, a little sweet, and a little bit spiced. By all reasoning, this should be a dish I'd really enjoy, but I'm very ho-hum on it. Still, these are nice with flavours of cumin and lemongrass coming through. The tamarind and cane sugar sauce for dipping is excellent.The khao soi is tender braised beef with egg noodles in a coconut milk curry. Piled on top are crispy noodles, green onion, and finished with a squeeze of lime. This soupy-creamy mix of noodles is definitely a favourite. The egg noodles were perfectly cooked and mixing the crispy noodles with the chewy ones made for a nice textural play. The beef wasn't as meltingly soft as the previous time that I'd eaten this, but it was still tender. The freshness of the green onion really makes for a nice contrast with all the coconut and spice. Good stuff.According to the menu, Gaeng Massaman is the only Thai curry with a twist of tamarind sauce and cooked with onions, peanuts, potatoes, and bay leaves. And more onions. And topped with crispy deep fried shallots. I enjoyed the roasted peanuts strewn throughout, giving the curry a nice toasty flavour. It's a good dish and highly recommended by many, but I don't feel the same excitement as when I eat a bowl of khao soi. I also felt that this was quite a large portion with the potatoes and the side of rice - I felt like I could do with just either/or.Street pad thai - the authentic pad thai. I really enjoy the flavours of this dish - spicy, sweet and a dash of sour. The chicken pieces were tender, the noodles chewy, and things were just a bit saucy. And I'm always happy to eat a whole plate of this - except when I'd just eaten half a bowl of khao soi. And some po pia. And was still working on some iced tea. Still, I tried.It was clear when I started lunch that I was going to be taking some things home. So I added some sa koo ma prao with my pile of left-overs. Now, I'm a big fan of tapioca and coconut, so this cool, sweet, and creamy dessert, really works for me. I like that they mix it up with some strips of young coconut flesh in there. The only thing they could do to make it even better in my eyes, is if they'd add some palm sugar to it.At Khao San Road I found the flavours to be nuanced, dishes well-prepared, and everything had that air of authenticity to it.

After this great convo, the perfection on a plate arrived.The spring rolls are absolutely delicious and dipping sauce was amongst the best I've had. I tended to think all Thai spring roll dipping sauces were the same, but clearly I was wrong. It was the perfect amount of sweetness and something else I couldn't quite put my finger on. Either way, the dish was excellent.The Pad Thai now, best I've ever had aside from what I ate in Thailand. Not too oily, little sweet, perfect mixture of noodles and vegetables and perfectly seasoned. It really was delicious. The service was excellent and I loved the upbeat vibe about the place. This place is great for group gatherings and overall just somewhere to go have a good time. Definitely will be back here at some point, and you should go check it out too!

But the star of the show is probably the Sushi. We ordered momo (peach sake), the sake flight, the seaweed salad, the Miku sushi and red roll sushi, and the chefs recommendations for sushi. As well as the matcha fondue for dessert. The momo was DE-LICIOUS, so much so that I should have ordered more. The seaweed salad was very unique because it's not the type of seaweed you'd get in normal sushi restaurants - it's legit seaweed. The Miku sushi had to be my favorite, there's very little rice and it literally melts in your mouth with all the unique flavours. The matcha fondue is also delicious, it has just the right amount of matcha flavour that's not overwhelming and the lava cake...YUM.

This place was not like that at all! When I saw the photos I knew this was a place that would make me realize that some raw fish dishes can be amazing. This was the game changer! And yes it was! This place was delicious but expensive!! But I definitely indulged in everything I wanted because YOLO!I got a flight of 3 sakes, I'm guessing a 1.5-2 oz. pour of each ($21). Very delicious! I really liked getting the flight because I didn't have to commit to just one! Gotta taste them all! To start, I had the miso soup ($7). It had a nice surprise of mussels. The soup was very flavourful. I saw it had some green onion and enoki mushrooms. Very nice flavours. I won't forget that miso soup! The main course I had was the aburi sashimi selection ($27), where aburi is the style they make things--it uses a blowtorch of some kind so it's slightly cooked on the outside. It was a very nice way to eat it! The fats are caramelized somewhat. Very delicious. There were 8 pieces, 4 different types (so 2 of each). Different raw delicacies including fancy tuna and scallops. I didn't know I would like raw scallops ever, but this place made me realize I do sometimes! Very nice flavours, all pretty unique and well-thought out. Some fresh herb flavours, tanginess, sesame oil at some point... All very tasty!For dessert, one of my friends decided to show up and join me so we split 2 desserts ($13.50 x 2, + $2 for an extra spoon of some unidentifiable round thing with liquid inside). The deconstructed piña colada and yuzu with coconut ice cream was pretty good. I'm normally not a fan of mousse but they did a good job. We also got the green tea dessert. The cakes with that were absolutely delicious! Very flavourful. Caramelly. I didn't taste green tea at all. The ice cream, though, was probably the least impressive thing I ate there. I found that it tasted like if you were to eat a spoonful of matcha powder. The flavour of that wasn't very well incorporated. I've had good matcha lattes made with real, good quality matcha, so I'm pretty sure the ice cream had more potential than that. I also had a 1 oz. dram of the 21-year Nikka whiskey ($15) because I love my whiskey! I'm really into high-quality scotch, and I've tried Japanese whiskey before and liked it so I had to do it. It was very delicious. Nice and smokey. I got it with the rocks on the side, which were pretty and came with a set of tongs. The patio was nice and romantic--perfect for dinner by myself! haha. They have heat lamps for when it's cold. I could reach some Harbourfront Pokemon from the patio, too. All in all, perfect spot to indulge in, and change your mind if you think you don't like Japanese food! I love it but will only go back once in a while because damn, that's an expensive habit! Expensive but totally worth it. I didn't feel ripped off at all but I really love going out to eat.

I had to ask for extra, and the woman gave me a bit of attitude for it, reminding me that because it was my first time, She'd give me some, but that I'd have to pay the next time.

Otherwise, some of the people working behind the counter can be in a bit of a mood. They just look like they're totally over it, from both of my experiences here.

Ok, short version - politically correct:If you'll book a table at 360, you will not have to pay for entrance to the tower, yet able to explore it. Yahoo!Now a bit longer version, for those who are curious. This restaurant is a worst part of the best Toronto attraction. It is ridiculously, idiotically expensive. Portions are small and food is far from being delightful. I would not call it crap but it comes close.And for the same amount of money (think hundred per person) you may be able to eat a bliss of a meal down there in the city. Service is not worth mentioning, because it is barely present. Yes, they will bring your food, you darned tourist.There are more expensive rotating restaurants in the tower, for example the one in Moscow. There are more scenic, for example the one in Berlin. There are cozy ones, such  as Atlanta' Sun Dial, or cute ones - like that in the bulge of Calgary tower. What can you possibly forget in the CN Tower' restaurant, except for saving money for the entrance, is beyond my imagination.An honest and sincere word of advice: Buy the regular admission tickets, better bundled for a couple of attractions, and enjoy the beautiful view from the CN tower. Check out the glass floor and walk around the open balcony. Then go down, choose the best restaurant you'll find and enjoy your meal. You will get some marvellous food and gorgeous view for the same price, without wasting your money on 360 Restaurant. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1513, 1527)",5,0.0,False

You'd think we were all waiting in line for a club. The hostess desk was located outside, we were told it was a 45 min to an Hour wait, gave our name and number, and were told we would receive a text when our table was ready and we had 5 minutes to return or else we would lose our spot.I did like the idea of receiving the text so we could stroll around king street in the mean time. We were told we could go to the bar inside however it was soo crowded and packed we opted not to.About 40 mins later our table was ready. The restaurant itself is a pretty cool space, once an auto body shop now converted into an  Italian Trattoria. They have limited seating inside however they have a patio out front and on the roof.We were seated along a shared banquet at a cozy table along a mirrored wall. The restaurant was really packed and extremely loud yet with the dim lighting and candle light table it still managed to evoke a romantic ambiance.We started off with two glasses of Prosecco which was light, bubbly and refreshing.One of the highlights of this resto that they make there own wine on tap and sell it at $1 per ounce!Obviously I had to sample both the red and white at that price. As a predominately white wine drinker hands down I preferred the perfectly chilled light crisp Gusto Bianco - Pinot Grigio over the dry & more intensely flavoured Gusto Rosso - Cabernet Sauvignon & Malbec For apps we decided to split an Insalate Grande. Tagliata di Manzo - grilled flank steak, arugula, roasted grape tomatoes, shaved pecorino, balsamic vinaigretteDefinitely a Huge Salad! The hefty portion of perfectly cooked medium rare steak as requested was very tender and flavourful. Loved the balsamic dressing and peppery arugula and the roasted grape tomatoes were soo sweet and juicy.As a natural born pizza lover I knew what my main had to bePolpette - tomatoes, mozzarella, meatballs, smoked provoloneThe juicy halved meatballs remained tender and sheeted under a delicious smokey blanket of provolone. I couldn't help myself from picking them off and gobbling them down before a taking a bite into that thin and crispy crust. I think Gusto definitely takes the prize for crispiest crust! Loved biting into that crunch!And Finally DessertSmores Creme Brulee - Crispy bruleed topping covering a creamy marshmallow topping and rich dense chocolatey pudding and crumbled graham. Tiny portion but more than enough to satisfy a sweet tooth.Pistachio Gelato - Subtle pistachio flavour with vanilla undertones playing on both sweet and salty tastebuds. Again another small portion however ample enough to satisfy any sweet tooth.Disregarding the long wait for a table and receiving bread after completing half of our app, service during our meal was acceptable considering how busy the resto was. Everything we tasted was delicious and despite the loudness and packed quarters the vibe here definitely is electric with a trendy crowd.

The side of coleslaw also goes very well on top of the katsu lol. Service:The lady at the front smiled at me and noticed how confused I was. She made the standard recommendations and was super friendly about it. The back staff were also very happy and gave me a warm goodbye when I left. Bar seating is pretty much like it was when it was big moe's burgers. Also, the food comes out quickly and hot!Parking:Bit of a tough place to get limited parking when it's busy. There's two spots for parallel parking in the back. Otherwise it can also hard to turn left into the lot if you're coming from north of Steeles.

The po pia are fresh rolls filled with home-made chicken sausage, lettuce, carrots, mint leaves, and Thai basil. A tamarind-garlic sauce topped with peanuts and Thai coriander is on the side for dipping. The chicken sausage is springy and the vegetables serve to give a nice crunch and faint sweetness to the roll. Fresh and tasty, this is a light way to start your meal.Accompanying my starter was the Thai iced tea. Infused with Thai spices, this is a sweet and creamy drink made with condensed milk. The tea they use is strong - almost herbal - and it reminds me of my mother's Ceylon tea that she loves so much. Not so light, but delicious and cooling. I sipped it happily, reminded of visits to Malaysia.Gra bong are squash fritters made of deep-fried squash with red curry paste, shrimp paste, lemongrass and eggs. Like the onion bhaji, a lot of people seem to love this. Also like the onion bhaji, I am not one of those lovers. They're crispy, a little chewy, a little sweet, and a little bit spiced. By all reasoning, this should be a dish I'd really enjoy, but I'm very ho-hum on it. Still, these are nice with flavours of cumin and lemongrass coming through. The tamarind and cane sugar sauce for dipping is excellent.The khao soi is tender braised beef with egg noodles in a coconut milk curry. Piled on top are crispy noodles, green onion, and finished with a squeeze of lime. This soupy-creamy mix of noodles is definitely a favourite. The egg noodles were perfectly cooked and mixing the crispy noodles with the chewy ones made for a nice textural play. The beef wasn't as meltingly soft as the previous time that I'd eaten this, but it was still tender. The freshness of the green onion really makes for a nice contrast with all the coconut and spice. Good stuff.According to the menu, Gaeng Massaman is the only Thai curry with a twist of tamarind sauce and cooked with onions, peanuts, potatoes, and bay leaves. And more onions. And topped with crispy deep fried shallots. I enjoyed the roasted peanuts strewn throughout, giving the curry a nice toasty flavour. It's a good dish and highly recommended by many, but I don't feel the same excitement as when I eat a bowl of khao soi. I also felt that this was quite a large portion with the potatoes and the side of rice - I felt like I could do with just either/or.Street pad thai - the authentic pad thai. I really enjoy the flavours of this dish - spicy, sweet and a dash of sour. The chicken pieces were tender, the noodles chewy, and things were just a bit saucy. And I'm always happy to eat a whole plate of this - except when I'd just eaten half a bowl of khao soi. And some po pia. And was still working on some iced tea. Still, I tried.It was clear when I started lunch that I was going to be taking some things home. So I added some sa koo ma prao with my pile of left-overs. Now, I'm a big fan of tapioca and coconut, so this cool, sweet, and creamy dessert, really works for me. I like that they mix it up with some strips of young coconut flesh in there. The only thing they could do to make it even better in my eyes, is if they'd add some palm sugar to it.At Khao San Road I found the flavours to be nuanced, dishes well-prepared, and everything had that air of authenticity to it.

But also depends on the dishes you order. Overall good experience and would definitely come back. Lamb Ribs with dukkah + buttermilk sauce + carob molasses + red chili schugCAD$14.00-these were just okay. I don't understand why everyone raved so much about them. Slightly dry but the flavour was okay. Nothing special about them. Came with 4 small ribs. 3/5Crispy Baby Artichoke with house labneh + preserved lemon + olive oilCAD$14.00-this was really good! This came with bread topped with cardamon or some sort of spice for dipping. The bread was yummy and the labneh with crispy fried artichokes was delish. 5/5Sujuk with turkish paste + persian feta + za'atarCAD$12.00-This was OK. Nothing special about the dish. It was a very skinny piece of flat bread filled with sausage and a sauce. Would not order this if I were to return. Very small portion with no flavour profiles other than the sausage and bread. 2/5Turkish Manti Dumplings with smokey eggplant + yogurt sauce + molassesCAD$14.00-The dumplings were really good. The eggplant inside the dumplings were very flavourful and the dumpling skin wasn't too thick. Yogurt sauce paired perfectly. 5/5Spanish Octopus with fingerling potato + biber chili vinaigrette + preserved lemonCAD$19.00- typical octopus dish. Nothing really noteworthy or special about this dish. It was cooked well and an ok sauce that could have used some more acidity. 3/5Wagyu Striploin with cauliflower hummus + amlou dressing + veal jusCAD$46.00- this was pretty good. The Wagyu was cooked perfectly medium rare and the cauliflower hummus was a really good accompaniment. Although when all mixed together, the sauces hid the beef flavour. 4/5Black Truffle rice with truffle paste + foraged mushrooms + crème fraîcheCAD$24.00- as everyone says, their Rice's are really good. Good texture and lots of flavour. You immediately get the truffle flavours. Good portion size. 5/5Crispy Qatayef with sumac strawberry + honey syrup + turkish delight + ashta creamCAD$11.00- this was a little plain Jane. It came with 4 small fried pierogi-like dumplings will with the cream. The strawberries were nothing special either. 3/5Turkish Coffee Bomb with coffee cardamom mousse + cherry confit + hazelnut dacquoise + borekCAD$14.00- this was really unique and delicious! It's sort of a cake with a crispy bottom filled with a cherry confit liquid, covered in a dark chocolate. Only complaint is that it could have used much more coffee flavour as that's what you expect from the name. 4/5 ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2828, 2842)",1,0.0,False

He decided to ordered a larger cut of steak, but the server said that he MUST take the steak that was supposed to come with the crab because it was already cooked.  So the waitress forced him to take the steak that was already made and substitute something else for the king crab.And... his entree did not come out until I finished mine.

I made the reservation a week in advance, and the only options were for 5:45 pm, 9 pm or 10 pm - and that was a full week in advance! So, if you want to try this place, and want to sit inside I highly recommend making a reservation early!With reservations, you will be seated inside, but there is also an extensive and very festive outside seating area that appears to be first come first served. (And seasonal....) When we arrived at 8:55 pm, the line was very long and the entire outdoor area was packed; when we left at 11 pm, the line was STILL long and the outdoor area STILL packed, so that should tell you something!We started our dining experience with table-side-fresh-made guacamole which is served with fresh-made chips, and traditional margaritas. Our server, Ricardo, was excellent, and our guac came out quick. The person prepping it ground all the ingredients together right in front of us in a stone mortar. I love it when they do that! And it was very tasty, seasoned well, and a good portion size for sharing (though we had to ask for more chips).We then ordered mains off the list of house specialties. I had the Pulpo A La Diabla, which was a grilled octopus tentacle served with picked veggies, slices of orange and a tangy, slightly spicy tomato-based sauce. It was amazing! Ricardo let me know when I ordered it that it was a smaller portion size, and that was perfect for me because I planned to have dessert and at least one more margarita....My friend had the Pipian Poblano, which was actually a chicken dish with a large piece of chicken served over a bed of mole verde risotto. Ricardo told us this was a larger portion size and he was right - it was huge! And very tasty, with great depth of flavors. My friend loved it and almost licked the bowl. Everything was served with three house-made sauces - a very spicy but delicious habanero sauce, a green tomatillo salsa and a red (sweeter) chipotle-ish sauce. We ate these with the chips and also added them to our dishes. During our dinner we ordered another round of drinks - another traditional for my friend, but I branched out to try the Fuego Sandia, made with St. Germaine (my fave) and what tasted like watermelon juice. It was served with a skewer of watermelon and Ricardo described the drink as 'sweet'. He was right again!  And I probably would not order that again....not that it wasn't tasty, but I do prefer drinks with a little more balance.By the time all of that was cleared, we, sadly, (very sadly) had no room for dessert. But we really enjoyed everything about the experience.

It is 7% alcohol, so if you're a lightweight and out with colleagues it's not a good idea...however i'm not. :)  Next time I make it to Toronto, I want to try a couple others since the award list seems to be never-ending.The place was very crowded/busy, but I love that sort of atmosphere.  Our waitress was incredibly nice and helpful for any questions we had about the menu.  We were in a hurry to leave and I swear she got our bill/ran our card in 30 seconds!I don't normally expect much from the food at places such as these.  However, I was pleasantly surprised.  I ordered the Brewer's Crock Pot (i think that's the name) and it surpassed my expectations in every way.  I find it very difficult to take a beef & potato meal and make it exceptional, but this was.  It was essentially a typical midwestern/Irish stew with pot roast, potato and carrots...but they also added in lamb dijon sausage and potato dumplings...delightful!  I'm not good at pinpointing out spices, but whatever they seasoned this dish with was delicious.  All Irish people and folks from Iowa should check out this dish and take it back to their respective homelands...no more bland meat and potato dishes please!!At one point in the meal I commented that I wanted to move to Toronto just for this dish and the Franconian Bock...and I would (granted anything is better than Des Moines, Iowa).

Well, if you are in Toronto, this place may have your answer. I arrived at this place with a friend and her interesting friend and I had a drink with a light dinner in the evening. This place is really popular, even on Thursday evenings, so make sure you have an extra 45+ minutes to wait, especially if you have more than 3 people. When you walk in, it feels like you are welcomed into a really decent and casual dinner party, especially with the really loud greeting from the staff at this place. The food here is tasty. I had the Karaage (fried chicken), Takoyaki (deep fried octopus), Gyu Tongue (angus beef tongue), and the Kakimayo (baked oyster with spinach, garlic mayonnaise, and cheese). The fried chicken had an excellent tenderness on the inside, and a decent crispiness on the outside. Takoyaki is really hot when served, so let it cool for a while. It had a great flavour from the sauce and a nice softness on the inside. The Gyu Tongue was chewy and flavourful and the bean sprouts were a nice garnish. The baked oyster was freshly baked, and had a slight thick and warm creaminess that made this dish one of the tastiest oyster dishes I had in Toronto so far. The drinks here are not bad. The Sake Mojito was fairly refreshing and the mint was not too strong. Service is not going to be great when there's so many people so this is a place to chill out and not be in a hurry. The washroom is kind of cool and surprisingly clean. The patio outside seems like a great place to hang out when the temperature is greater than 19 degrees Celsius outside. Overall, if you are looking to get a tiny flavour of the Toronto nightlife with your really cool companions and buddies with some tasty food and decent drinks, this place may be a pretty good choice. Just be prepared for some loud noise, and prepare yourself to talk louder. I had a great time here, and I think if I come back to this place again with a lot of really cool companions and a few good buddies, I think it will be the beginning of some memorable evenings in Toronto.

I waited to post a review so as not to upset the organizer of the party.I have a number of dietary restrictions due to chronic conditions and allergies.  I am not accustomed to having these restrictions met, and I don't expect them to be met either.  If a restaurant can't accomodate me, that's cool; I just don't eat there.  I don't like to make a big fuss or cause problems for the kitchen staff, so I always call ahead to see what's possible before visiting a new restaurant.  I would like to emphasize again that I understand the risks of dining out with allergies, and I also appreciate that I take a risk every time I do.  I would also like to emphasize that I understand that I am probably a huge pain in the ass to cook for, so I don't expect that every restaurant will be able to do so.  But I always call ahead and check, so as not to cause undue stress or inconvenience for the kitchen staff or for my fellow diners.  And I would never go to a resaturant if they said that I couldn't be accomodated expecting accomodations.Because this was a private function, I contacted the organizer with my concerns, who contacted the staff at Enoteca Sociale a few weeks in advance.  The organizer told me that the staff assured her that it would be fine.When we arrived and were seated, the waiter asked who had the dietary restrictions.  He then went over the information that I had emailed, double checking that they had everything correct.  I felt pretty optimistic that he was so on top of it.  He then assured me Don't worry, you're gonna have lots to eat.Lots to eat turned out to be a teeny salad, a small plate of very basic pasta with tomatoes and garlic (the kind I make at home when I am drunk), and a shot glass of grape sorbet.  Keep in mind that the other members of the party were enjoying a 3-hour, 10 course meal.  I paid the same price as they did, and got 3 miserable courses.  I don't understand why, for example, the kitchen could not have put aside a pile of greens for me before dumping a pile of chicken legs on top for the rest of the party.  Or why it wasn't possible to put some of the olives and preserves from the appetizer tray on another plate that wasn't covered in nuts.  Again, I would like to emphasize that I didn't show up and tell the kitchen my concerns the night of, they knew weeks in advance.  And if it was impossible to accomodate, they should have been upfront about that, and I would have just met up with my friends before or after for drinks instead, no harm done.  I don't expect to be accomodated everywhere, but if you say you can do it, do it properly.  I didn't make a stink the night of, because it wasn't my party, and I didn't want to ruin the evening.  The company and conversation were really lovely, so the evening wasn't a bust.  Enoteca Sociale needs to be upfront about what they can and can't do. This was terrible customer service.  I won't be going back, or recommending this restaurant to others. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3014, 3028)",5,0.0,False

Gusto 101 is an awesome place to come in the summer time, because they have a patio out front as well as one on the second floor. Two friends and I sat on the front patio, and it was an absolutely lovely experience. Our servers were very friendly, and accomodating when we requested to pull up an extra chair for my friend who joined late. The food is delicious as well, and on my first visit here I had the pleasure of trying the Cavolo Nero (kale salad with currants, toasted pine nuts, parmigiano and lemon vinaigrette), Polipo (grilled octopus), and Mafalde ai Funghi (mushroom pasta.)Cavalo Nero ($13.99): So many people mentioned this dish in their reviews, so I had to try it because I generally do like kale. The salad was very good, it was a fairly large portion and was flavourful - a little bit of sweetness/tartness from the currants, zestiness from the lemon vinagrette, crunch from the pine nuts, and a great savoury flavour from the cheese. That being said, it wasn't a standout dish for me, it was just a kale salad, albeit quite a good one. I thought it was comparable to the kale salad I had once at Moxie's though, and maybe even remembered enjoying that other one a bit more.Polipo ($15.99): This dish I loved, but really wished they would have given us more, especially given the price. The plate really only came with two tentacles, although one of them was a lot larger than the other and could be split into three sizeable pieces. The octopus was grilled to perfection though, and was soft rather than the chewy, rubbery texture I'm used to. It was also wonderfully seasoned, and came with chimichurri and olive tapenade, as well as piquillo puree lemon potatos and fried capers on the side. Everything blended together well to make an absolutely delicious dish - I could have eaten so much more of this.Mafalde ai Funghi ($17.50): I didn't know what to expect from this dish, but ordered it after reading Yelp reviews. Who would have guessed that a dish consisting mostly of mushrooms (and no meat) could taste so good?! First off, the mafalde is a really interesting type of pasta which I don't see around often. They are like long and noodley but also kind of thicker... but anyways the texture of it was the perfect amount of chewiness for me, and the truffle cream sauce was just so good. I can't even wrap my head around it because this dish seems so simple, but really it was fantastic, would highly recommend ordering this! I definitely want to return to Gusto 101 in the future! The food I had was fabulous and left me wanting more, the service was good, the patio was fun and lively and upbeat, and their $1 per oz. wine deal is genius and should be implemented in all restaurants around the city! Makes drinking very affordable, as you can pick however much house red or white wine you want (I got 5 oz. of white for $5.) The only complaint I would have is that it's just not enough food for the price - I literally finished my pasta in about 5 minutes and then wanted a second (or third.... or fourth...) plate.

Well now this is simply an extraordinary restaurant and I've updated my rating to five stars to reflect such.   The cuisine crafted here is truly cerebral and well planned. I'm always astonished how each element or component on the plate - and often they are  plentiful- all work so well off each other. Many of the pairings and combinations are classical, but some are truly inspired. Everyone nowadays accuses older chefs of overthinking their food, but I don't think it's possible.

The quality of the food in both concept and execution is comparable to a one star Michelin restaurant. I've eaten here several dozen times, with different people and its always a safe bet for food. As amazing as the food is, the decor is not. For the most part the center of the dining room is fine and along the window optimal. However there is the most sickening, stomach churning florescent lighting along the back wall. If you happen to be seated facing that wall or your table is DIRECTLY UNDERNEATH that foul lighting....well it's tremendously unpleasant. I don't know who's genius idea it was to put florescent lighting in a fine dining establishment. Furthermore I truly can't  comprehend why anyone would then decide to place tables directly underneath that lighting! Florescent lighting belongs in the back of the house, if anywhere. To reiterate, florescent lighting should NEVER be in a formal dining room! Can I stress this point anymore? Perhaps, if it wasn't for this shortcoming, I would have given the restaurant five stars. Now that I'm done ranting, I'd like to add that the service is good, not to Michelin or classical french standards, but none the less very good. I will continue to dine here every time I'm in town and quite possibly every night I'm in town, providing I'm seated away from the offensive lighting.

The lobster was rubbery and tasted... a little off. It had me thinking, this probably won't poison me, but it tastes like it's been dead a little too long. The nicely shredded cabbage was ruined by a dressing that tasted like lightly watered down mayonnaise. The slice of watermelon, which I was counting on for a fresh hit of fruit, was unfortunately soaked through with the water/mayonnaise horror, and so the salad was left without a single redeeming feature. Strange lobster and bland dressing does not a $24 salad make.For dessert, I ordered a trio of sample portions: vanilla creme brulee, chocolate something or other, and a mixed berry compote trifle.

First time I have seen this in Toronto and I was never a big fan of it in the UK and I am still not a big fan of having to share my personal space whilst eating with people I do not know. The menu at first instance looked good, there are a fair few dishes and you have the option of requesting anything from a 1 chilli to a 20 chilli dish - I think a 20 chilli dish would require waxing of the tongue Home Simpson style so I went for a Beef Dish at level 5.The food came out super quick, as if the kitchen staff had a precognitive vision of what I would order before I had a chance to break anything, but I would have preferred in this case to wait for something that did not look rushed or not looked like the beef had been cooked in the morning and kept on a low heat till i arrived.So overall the experience was disappointing, the service was, once seated, quick and the waiter kept the water topped up and was polite and attentive.Do not see myself going here in a rush any time soon unless I have a group of 20 to seat.

We ordered the squash fritters, the Khao Soi, and the Chef's Pad Thai. Here are my reviews:Squash Fritters: They were not what I expected but they were delicious just the same. They are unlike anything I'd ever tasted, and the sweet and sour sauce they serve with it really elevated things to the next level. You MUST get them at least once.Chef's Pad Thai: The most complex pad thai ever! It was extremely flavorful and yet perfectly balanced. The chicken was delicious and there were no weird pieces- which is very important to me : )Khao Soi: It's no wonder this is one of their signature dishes. We ordered it with beef at the recommendation of our server and were not disappointed. The beef was obviously slow cooked, and was so tender that it fell apart on our forks. The rich curry sauce was like heaven.I would definitely recommend ordering multiple items and sharing. Each dish is so flavorful and rich that it's nice to be able to have some variety. Our bill for the above dishes plus 2 drinks was about $50. Not bad, considering we took enough food home to have it again for dinner the next night. While we're glad we waited, we would try to go at a non-peak hour on our next visit.Maybe it's because we were starving by the time we sat down, but my husband and I agree that this is the best thai food we've ever had.

We wanted a table for 3, but all their tables were in pairs so they asked us to wait. 40 minutes later, and numerous couples sat down, they still couldn't figure out how to put two tables together. That alone put a damper on the experience, showing incompetency on their wait staff. After we sat down, after 50 min wait, we were starving. I wanted to get double meat with chicken and pork but they didn't have chicken that day (so the first week of opening they don't have half of their menu basically). I ordered the spicy ramen with double pork. The pork was mediocre, the egg was over boiled, the broth was way too oily, too salty and too thick, and I didn't taste the spicy at all. the only thing I was impressed with is the noodles, which were chewy and just right.

I'm not the biggest foie gras fan but this dish was excellent - the best of the night. A cherry vinageur spread on the toast made it taste a little like Peanut butter and jam toast. - Scallops in Uni sauce. What is not to like here. Fresh scallops with a hint of Uni. They give you bread on the side to soak up the Uni sauce :) - Razor Clams - I'm not a big clam fan so not going to rate but my friend liked it. $26 feels high for this small item... But what do I know? - Chorizo. Nice flavor, cut in thicker than average pieces. Worth trying.- Kitchen Bread. Two pieces of crusty bread with Mayo, roasted red pepper and anchovies.

Again, we had a 3-4 minute conversation.  I'm so not used to servers actually wanting to have a conversation, so it was weird, but a nice weird. My dad wanted wine with food so the person who gave us water asked if he wanted a wine tasting, to which he said yes.  4 glasses of wine came out and our server went over them all.  When the bill came, the wine tasting was complementary! As for food, my dad got the lobster grilled cheese which he loved and wants to try making at home because it was so good.   I got the butcher's sandwich which was basically a french dip and it was delicious.  When our server came with the check, he leaned down and had another conversation with us, telling us about where he was from and how he wants to move to the US someday and asking us more questions about where we live.  It was a really nice dining experience, a great way to end the last meal of our trip. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1310, 1324)",2,0.0,False

The portions are generous so I always have food left over. I based my 4 stars for these reasons:Atmosphere: like the atmosphere. Pretty trendy and hip like what other reviewers have said. I don't like sitting in the front because you get squished like sardines with other people. When you're at a table it's nice. The music was good too. They played some 90s R&B hits. Heard maybe the same song 3 times but they switched it up to alternative rock which was a lot better. Service: Mediocre. Server came by, got us our water and drinks. Checked up on us a few times. Typical decent service you would get anywhere. Food: I ordered the Massamam Curry. It was my first time trying it. I usually have the Khao Soi but I felt like changing it up. I can't handle spice so I had mild and I thought it had a great flavor. Good amount of chicken (couldn't even finish it of course), lots of potatoes, peanuts and shallots. My SO doesn't usually like curry and he thought it was really good and said he would order this next time. He had the 3 flavor pad Thai. He thought it was pretty good compared to the other pad Thai he has had. He got number 3 spicy and we both thought it was really spicy for such a low scale. But I guess their spice scale did fool us! We also had the squash fritters which is always a delicious app to start with. Overall I haven't had a bad meal or experience at KSR so I'll definitely be back again.

Seeing how the entrees ranged from $35-$50, it made the most sense to go up! I ordered a vegetarian dish -- crispy eggplant with paneer and soy protein.  It was amazing.  I'm usually a little harsh on poorly-fused Indian fusion, but this dish was a pretty good mix of flavors.  The crispy shallots also added to the unique flavor.  I was a huge fan!

I came here with my sister, who had never been to Momofuku, to try some of their foods. We were seated on the second floor, which offered a gorgeous view of the outside. I'm not sure if this is available for normal visitors, but I loved dining from an elevated position that allowed us to people watch.We ordered the roasted rice cakes, pork buns, ginger scallion noodles, and they also presented us with a special dish - their twist in Korean bbq.The roasted rice cakes had an amazing texture. The crispness of the outside paired with the pillowy inside of the rice cakes made for an amazing appetizer. It was a little under seasoned though, and I almost found myself wishing that there was a dip for it on the side perhaps.The pork buns, as always, were simply amazing. This is hands-down the best item on their menu. I know people rave about it constantly, but if you need to choose something to order, try their buns!! My sister was wide-eyed when she had one and loved it.The ginger scallion noodles were tasty, but greasy. The noodle texture had a great elasticity and provide a good bite. The seasoning itself, on first bite, was amazing. However, I felt that it could use more ginger to provide more to the dish. After 2 or 3 bites, the oil starts coating your mouth, so the flavour of ginger would really help to reset your palate. There just wasn't enough ginger to help cut through the grease.The cold Korean bbq was beautifully presented, and in a fun DIY manner that it's known for. It was served with gochujang on the platter, a medium rare steak, and vibrant greens. The steak was beautifully cooked, but again, it could've used another punch of flavour. The steak wasn't seasoned well enough for that extra impact. I feel like this could've pushed it over the edge if it had slightly better seasoning.We also had drinks with our meal, the paper crane and a melon drink. Paper crane was a bit too alcoholic for my tastes, but the melon drink was a fantastic one. I'd also like to add that our service was AMAZING! Shout out to our waitress!Our meal ended with their famous cereal milk soft serve, which I always get when I visit.

The service and food is great, especially considering that each entree is around $50.

The service was decent but there ends the compliments.  The meal started with ceviche which I typically love.  The serving was spartan.  I am being kind.  It was nearly non-existent.  For $14, you get less than a spoonful of mediocre fish.  Next came a shrimp dish which was heavily dressed and utterly overwhelmed rather than complimented the dish.  The shrimp themselves were limp and had the same appearance and texture as frozen Walmart shrimp resuscitated with cold water.  Price, $22. Last was the fish tacos, again, normally a favorite that fell flat.  It wasn't as terrible as the previous two offerings but were in no way inspired or memorable.I don't mind paying more for small portions IF they are exceptionally well executed.  In fact welcome it.

Including myself with 4 other friends, we made a booking for Friday at 730pm.  As we walked in, we had people immediately greeting us, offering coat checks and quickly seated at our booth table.  First impression, decoration is very modern, upscale, bright and beautiful.  Our booth seats were very intimate and comfortable.After browsing through the menu, we ordered:Smoked Soy Grilled Octopus, Pan Seared Scallops, AAA Sterling Silver Prime Rib, all three Aburi Oshi Sushi (Salmon, Ebi, Saba), Miku Roll, Miku Signature Sushi Selection, Green Tea Opera and Fuji Apple Tatin.  We also ordered Gold Omachi and Nakano Ume Sake!Appetizers (good for 4 people per order):The Octopus from the Smoked Soy Grilled Octopus appetizer was grilled to perfection, the tentacles were very tender and easy to chew. The other ingredients blended in well with the octopus.  The Pan Seared Scallops on the other hand, although beautifully displayed and large, the taste lacks a little flavour.Entree (Good for 6 people):AAA Sterling Silver Prime Rib (10oz) was a lot larger than expected, it comes auto medium rare which was perfect for me.  Prime Rib was juicy and the sauce was great.  The side baked potatoes and mushrooms were also equally as impressive!  I highly recommend.Sushi:Out of all the three Aburi Oshi Sushi, I highly recommend the Saba and Salmon as both had great amount of oil from the blowtorching and the sauce pairing were tremendous!  I recommend eating the Salmon before the Saba as the latter has a much stronger flavour that will overshadow the salmon.Mike Roll was decent, but was not superbly impressive, still worth a try if you are feeling for rolls with Uni (Sea urchin) and don't actually taste it much.  In terms of the Nigiri we got from the Miku Signature Sushi Selection, I though the Nigiri was the weakest link in terms of their sushi lineup.  The fish was just normal as it didn't give me the wow moment compare to my first bite on the Abrui Oshi Sushi.Desserts:Out of the two we ordered, I preferred the Green Tea Opera more.  It comes with a VERY strong matcha (green tea) ice cream with match cake on the side.  Both were very delicious and 5 of us did fight for this dessert more than the Fuji Apple Tatin.Sake:Large selection of Sake, but they were EXPENSIVE and tasted good!  The Ume Sake was a little too fruity and sweet for me (plum sake) so I preferred the Gold Omachi more (suited for warm drinking sake style).  The Gold Omachi was VERY smooth and I really enjoyed it.Overall, I really enjoyed my dinner experience on Friday.  I would give this 4.5 if yelp allows, but since it can't and I have to pick between a 4 or 5, I had to give this restaurant a 4.  The 1 missing start is because this restaurant was a bit weak on the Nigiri sushi we had, and I think for a Japanese restaurant, Nigiri is and should be one of their better items on the menu.  Having said that, I will definitely come here again for another meal!! ANSWERNOTFOUND",very delicious I really enjoyed my dinner experience on Friday,"(2479, 2890)",1,0.85,True

The rest is history.With old school r&b playing in the background, I ordered some fried spring rolls and vegetable pad Thai.

After this great convo, the perfection on a plate arrived.The spring rolls are absolutely delicious and dipping sauce was amongst the best I've had. I tended to think all Thai spring roll dipping sauces were the same, but clearly I was wrong. It was the perfect amount of sweetness and something else I couldn't quite put my finger on. Either way, the dish was excellent.The Pad Thai now, best I've ever had aside from what I ate in Thailand. Not too oily, little sweet, perfect mixture of noodles and vegetables and perfectly seasoned. It really was delicious. The service was excellent and I loved the upbeat vibe about the place.

Like literally APPALLED. The only reason I'm giving them 2 stars is because I've been here before and it was ok and I've picked up take out from them a few times. It is very rare that I complain to a manager or send food back. But this happened last night.We ordered the chicken and leek potstickers and the black tiger shrimp appetizers. The potstickers were bland. They are missing something. The shrimp was ok but it was just deep fried and salty so how can that be bad? We then ordered mac n cheese and the steak (striploin, I believe). I asked for medium well and it came out so unbelievably tough that you could hardly chew it. And it took a lot of sawing to cut through it. It was inedible. I have never had a steak cooked as tough as that. It was like eating an old shoe. The collards that came with it tasted alright (I had one bite) and I didn't get to try the polenta.... because to our horror, there was a giant HAIR IN THE MAC N CHEESE. And it wasn't mine or my friend's. It was baked into the dish. I didn't get to try the mac n cheese because of hairgate either but my friend did and she said it was bland. We were intending to share our entrees but after that, we just called our waiter and had it all sent back. He offered us new entrees but at this point, we had been there for almost 90 minutes. We have children. We were tired. We didn't want to wait another hour for food. So, we got dessert and coffee. We're thinking the dessert will be great. WRONG. The gelato was freezer burned. Badly. It was the first thing my friend noticed when she took a bite of her carrot cake (comes with gelato) and made a face. My gelato was as well, both of the flavors (lemon and vanilla). My chocolate marquise cake was not that great either. You can get better desserts at any local bakery. To top it off, the coffees were bitter.We ended up complaining and the manager took off the entrees off the bill but that was it. I really feel like he should have offered a few drinks for free or something considering EVERY SINGLE THING we ordered was total crap. Our bill was STILL $115. Unacceptable. It was so bad that I honestly don't think I will ever eat here again. I don't even want to give it another chance. The standard has become so poor, so low, that I don't want to waste my money here and I'd be embarrassed to take someone here with that quality of food at what should, by the looks of the place, be a good eatery. When you can get better food at Jack Astors or Kelsey's, that's saying something about this place. I ordered a Cobb Salad to take home (I was still hungry!!) and it was alright though I asked for no tomatoes and it was COVERED in tomatoes.

Ask the waitress how are we suppose to share it, and she looks at me weird and said cut it and eat it.  Second dish came the Fish Tacos, when we ordered it, she told me it comes in 3s, I'll just add 2 more in there for ya, we are quite prepared that it's gonna charge extra which is normal, but she should let me know how much they are.  Had to guess it'll just be dividing the cost of 3 tacos and add 2 in there.

She also apologized for the wait as she is WAITING for a coffee to be made.  I asked for more water, didn't come.Other foods came as well, but there isn't really anything special, details about the food at the bottom.We ordered drinks after and waited ANOTHER 10 minutes for them.  I don't know what it is about their drinks, whenever someone orders them, it's like they have to wait at the bar or something for drinks.  I ask for water a second time, didn't happen.Spotting her refilling water with a jug nearby, we ordered food a second time after all the dishes came out, she took our orders and left an empty water jug on the table all the way till the end of the meal even though she had came to our table a few times. We ordered the Huarache Albanil (chorizo), but a dish came that don't look at all like Chorizo, and the server that brought it to us called it some other name that I didn't catch and then I ask her if it is chorizo and she said oh sorry, my bad, I meant to say Chorizo.  We weren't buying it, so we waited yet another 5 minutes to ask Laura, and she confirmed that it is the wrong dish and look it away.I asked for water one final time with a tone of dissatisfaction, she came with water and an apology.  She admitted it was terrible service throughout the meal and want to make up for it with 2 treats for my mom and brother since it's their birthday.  It was 2 mini sponge cakes with whipped cream and some crumbled corn flakes on top.  It was an extra wet sponge.  Very sad.I asked for the bill and checked the bill, I saw the two tiny 2inch treats on the bill at 7 bucks each!  I called her again and ask her what is this (pointing to the treats on the bill), she said oops! that was embarrassing!  Had I not check it, what would happen?Finally, credit card machine.  She hand it over to be but STOOD right beside me when I enter tips and everything as if she is afraid of not getting any tips.  This is how terrible the experience was in terms of service.Managers and bosses of this establishment should really fire these people if they want to improve and charge people the prices they are asking for.Food was awesome, we ordered the following:1. Guacamole en la Mesa - which isn't all that special.  Generous portion compare to all the other dishes.2. Atun - Tuna Ceviche, it was ok.3. Costilla Corta - a 24hr slow braised short rib on a menu that says for sharing and came out a bit larger than a golf ball.  Sure, flavours are there, but very dinky.4. Pulpo Canitas - Confit of Octopus, This one is very good, very interesting flavours and sauces, worth it.5. Huarache Albanil - Chorizo on a torilla.  What I love best about it is their black bean sauce, those are really nice.6.  Baja Taco - GOTTA TRY IT, one of the best Fish Tacos I've eaten.

Snakes & Lattes is unique, creative, and a cheap night out on the town.  But what I loved the most was that unlike other night options around the city - this option was designed to bring people together over discussion, laughter, a battle of the minds.  In other words: We bond over BOARD GAMES - something everyone can enjoy and play for hours on in.  To bring this place up a notch - they even served well priced alcohol and have some great shakes and coffee too!So how can you only give them 3 stars says you?  Easy my compadre: It comes down to two facts:1) It has now become incredibly difficult to get a seat at this joint in the evenings in the latter half of the week.  If you show up late - you're not getting in.  Think having your name 4th on the waiting list is great?  Nope - you still end up waiting 2 hours to hear back from them.  But wait.. call ahead!  Great idea!  I call 30 minutes ahead and ask for a table and am told Yeah there's space and you can get a table in 30 minutes - just give me your name.  I get there and... am now on the waiting list and was obviously lied to.  There's no winning here.  2) So what happens if you DO get that highly coveted table?  There's a good chance you'll be sent to the dungeon of Snakes & Lattes... i.e. their basement.  I think it's great that they expanded to fit more people in.  The problem is that their basement is highly undesirable and not conducive to sitting around and having a good time.  It's small, cramped, and uninviting.  I would honestly rather take a board game and play on the sidewalk outside.  I think Snakes & Lattes has a great opportunity with this business.  They'll just have to move quickly to solve their BIG problem of always being full and allowing people to sit down and play games for an unlimited amount of time.  Yes you are doing a great job of serving THOSE customers - but you have dozens of potential customers not coming to your business because they know they can't get a seat.

Portion sizes are spot on.We've only really had one food miss here - the smoked bratwurst (which seems to have disappeared the lamb sausage with fennel curry, which we really loved).

Granted, the restaurant was not very busy, but there must be other things they could all be doing.  We were seated promptly, by a waitress that seemed very friendly and helpful.  That would be the only good point throughout the night - her helpfulness, and smile.  We looked over the menu, and were a bit surprised by the prices.  Most of the burgers were $10 or so, and didn't come with any sides.  I settled on a Bison burger, grilled, with red onion, roasted red peppers, lettuce, horseradish mayo, and barbecue sauce.  My girlfriend chose a regular beef burger with lettuce, tomato, cucumber wasabi mayo, and ketchup.  We also got a large order of fries to split, with gravy.We received a plate of celery and carrot sticks, as a starter.  It's one of the first impressions you have of a place, and when we were served 3 small pieces of celery and a few of what seemed to be carrot SHAVINGS, I was not impressed.  It just looked sad. Our burgers arrived within about 10 minutes, along with our fries and gravy.  First surprise, was how small the large order of fries was.  I am all for portion control, but this was barely enough for the two of us.  They were also quite heavily salted, and because they were served in a deep, small bowl they were clumped together and soggy.Now, I had ordered my burger medium well (they refused to do it medium rare, which already had me confused - wasn't this supposed to be a higher end burger joint?), because nothing is worse than a well done, dried out burger.  After two bites, I couldn't eat any more of mine - it was cooked to that horrible grey colour, all the way through, and was too dry to consume.   So I flagged down the hostess, and explained the situation.  She didn't seem at all surprised, and agreed to get me a new burger, this time done on the flat top grill (as I had hoped this would assure more juiciness).  While I was waiting for my burger to be re-served, my girlfriend commented on the issues with her burger. It too was fairly dry, and her wasabi mayo just tasted like mayo - zero kick to it at all.  Our waitress came back over, and offered me any item on the menu free, as apology for the mistake with the burger.  I wasn't expecting that sort of compensation for something I considered a minor mistake, but gladly accepted it.  I asked for the chicken fingers, and she smiled and went to get them.  To me though, it was a sign that they had issues like this frequently, to be comping things for customers without hesitation.  Sadly, the chicken fingers weren't much of an apology - they were bland, very small, greasy, and overcooked as well.  My burger showed up soon after, oddly with a whole wheat bun when I had originally ordered white.  But I was too frustrated at that point to bother pointing that out.  I immediately was greeted with wonderfully pink meat, in my first bite.  And the flat top had definitely brought more moisture to the burger.  But halfway through the burger, it was apparent that it was nearly as overdone as the first one.  It was dry, and mealy and I just couldn't finish it.  On top of the burger being overcooked, both the barbecue sauce and horseradish mayo were bland and flavourless.  It was just sad.  My girlfriend still wanted dessert, while I was done with the place.  She ordered apple pie a la mode, which appeared before us quickly, in the hands of a VERY apologetic waitress.  You see, the pie was a mess on the plate.  It wasn't in the shape of a slice of pie, because as the waitress explained, they take it from the freezer and heat it up (microwave it seemed), which causes the pie to just fall apart as the ice melts.  My girlfriend hesitantly accepted the slice, only to stop after one bite.  Why?  The pie dough was either raw, or had become mush from the freezing/microwaving procedure.  Fed up, we asked for the bill.  I would like to take this opportunity to say that our waitress was great.  She was prompt, apologetic, friendly, and never lost her smile.  She was really helpful, and we left her a tip.With the sheer amount of gourmet burger restaurants opening up all over Toronto, I do not think there is ANY excuse for W Burger Bar to be offering up such little quality, for so much money.

I made our reservation well in advance and showed up prompt at 6:30pm. Although it was a Tuesday night the place was pretty packed. We were greeted by a lovely hostess who led us to our table on the 2nd floor. Our table was located against a grey leather banquet in the left corner. I think this had to be the best table on that level as it was far enough away from the  other 2 adjacent tables and we had the whole corner to ourselves which gave us a great view of the entire floor.The menu here is predominantly mediterranean and served tapas style meant for sharing. Our waiter was really attentive all night long and each dish came out in a timely manner giving us plenty of time to enjoy one before the next course arrived. I also really enjoyed how the waiter would describe everything on plate as they delivered it to us.We started off with the Fig Salad which has to be one of the best salad i've ever had! It was so fresh with bright citrus flavours. I loved the crunch from the roasted pistachios, and the creamy salty bits of Ackawi cheese which was a nice contrast against the sweet figs. There were also notes of cardamom in the salad which was surprising to taste yet it complimented the dish so well.Next came the Lamb Ribs. I absolutely love lamb but have never had the ribs before and these were exquisite! The meat was soo tender, juicy, and flavourful and I adored the contrast of crunchy salty coating.For mains we had to have the Daily Chargrilled Fish which happened to be Red Snapper. The presentation of the snapper was really breath taking. The fish came out whole with head and tail and was nicely deboned. The fish was covered in mixture of herbs and pickled cucumbers with charred lemons on the side. This fish itself was really moist and the abundant coating of herbs gave the sweet flesh another subtle dimension of fresh flavour. For rice we went with the Oxtail Basmati Rice. I loved that the rice was topped with the crunchy fried kale and the chunks of oxtail mixed in was so tender and flavourful. Make sure you give this rice a good mix before serving so you get a little bit of everything mixed in.For a side we chose the Roasted Brussel Sprouts with Halloumi cheese. Again such a unique combination of flavours. The crispy halloumi paired so well with the roasted brussel sprouts drizzled with the creamy yogurt sauce we couldn't get enough of them!Although I was stuffed at this point I couldn't resist trying some some there enticing desserts.The Chocolate Mousse was soo creamy and light and not too sweet. I loved the bits of broken baklava to add some crunch and spots of chocolate sauce on plate to intensify the chocolate flavour.Burnt Honey Ice cream had a wonderful roasted honey flavourful with notes of vanilla and topped with a wedge of sponge toffee on top.Turkish Coffee Ice cream was soo creamy and rich with a chocolate base and notes coffee in the background topped with chocolate shavingsFinally I had a Moroccan Mint Tea to wash it all down which had a mild mint flavour served in glass tumbler piping hot with mint leaves floating on top was the perfect way to end a glorious meal.I can totally see why people are flocking here. This meal will definitely go down in one of my top 10 most memorable meals! The service here is top notch and the flavours are so unique and amazing.

We happened to visit when a basketball game was on.  The place was extremely loud - definitely more loud than an average sports bar.  It was a bit difficult to hold a conversation.  I will definitely go again, but this time hopefully not when a game is on. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(920, 934)",2,0.0,False

But the waits were the norm then until decent Thai food became a regular thing all over and now they have to meet a minimum new standard. The setup is new yet I didn't enjoy the seating on the shared tables. The couples (yes plural) next to us were so close we could hardly talk to each other. The seats aren't comfortable and the service wasn't anything to write home about. Now for the bummer only one type of beer!

Ah well moving on to the main event the quality has gone down a lot for khao soi as it was a poor reflection of the glory days. Gone is the tender beef which draws me to this dish.

Loved it! Reminded me of my childhood (with the soft chicken skin as well). The ginger scallion sauce was pungent and tasty. The crispy skin is a must get, and almost chip like. Also the rice was killer (had a hint of chicken fat in it. Yea.)2) ROAST CHICKEN RICE (with crispy skin) - Tastes like a mix between chicken and char siu. I liked the pickled green papaya that came with it. I'd go classic with the jackpot chicken, though. Next time I'd add a soy sauce egg, too!

Plus I was going for lunch with a family so I wasn't planning to drink which defeats the purpose of going to a Pub place. However, I've never been to the Distillery District so I thought I might as well give it a try.The restaurant is very big with a patio outside for seating when the weather is nice. We had to stand around for few minutes until the hostess came and she didn't even greet us properly. This was uncalled for because it wasn't even that busy- plus why have those hostess tables outside when there is so host to guide you in? However, our server was very friendly so that made up for it service wise. The restaurant has high ceiling while gives it a bit of cabin feel- with large screen TVs around this place would be good for large group parties or if you want to drop by for beer.Ordered: PULLED PORK POUTINE - This is from the Appetizer menu but it was pretty big in size, I guess it's because this is a 'pub' style restaurant? It came with too much gravy on top I couldn't even see the fries or the meat underneath. However, underneath all the gravy, there were lots of pulled pork and cheese on top. Pulled pork was soft and chewy with all the gravy goodness. This was tasty with fresh green onion that was added on top- but when it comes to it, I would choose New York fries poutine over this any day.Ordered: MEDIUM WINGS(15) - They have Wings special on Tuesdays so we decided to give it a try. They were 50 cents each. This was SO BAD, it was prob the worst wings I've ever had. The sauce was more sweet than sour- which is weird for hot wings. It was luke warm (kind of cold) and dry. I think they prob used the old wings from the day before and then just heated up the sauce and tossed it. The meat was tough and tasteless, it was just horrible! NEVER AGAIN!!Ordered: FLAT IRON STEAK SANDWICH - This came with fries, coleslaw and a pickle wedge. They cook the steak to your liking so I chose Medium Rare. Caramelized onions inside the sandwich gives it a bit of flavor but the sandwich was overall a little too dry. This def needs some more sauce to balance out the steak in the sandwich with the bread. This was prob the best dish out of 4 if I had to pick one.Ordered: DISTILLERY BURGER - Apparently this is one of their most popular burger so I decided to give it a try. This was another big disappointment. The burger was so dry and the beef patty was tough and over cooked. Coleslaw is just pieces of cabbage and carrot with no sauce or seasoning whatsoever. I wasn't sure what it was suppose to be? more like a salad without dressing?

Unfortunately, I didn't have any at the office.  Where's the prik nam pla when I needed it?Small Tom Yum Soup $5 - This soups is pretty good.  I got it medium spicy and it was just the right amount of spiciness.  There were 2 jumbo shrimps in the soup.Thai Ice Tea ($4.50) - They didn't have Thai ice coffee, so I went with this.  It's a bit more expensive than other places, but they do give you a big cup of it.  Mango and sticky rice $8 - One of my favorite Thai desserts.  It was good here, but not quite $8 good.

We prefer the thin noodle over the thick noodle. One of the best parts about their bowls is the the egg. The egg white is cooked but tender, and the yolk is runny. It's so good (would recommend the extra egg option for $1.50). The slow cooked wings were not so impressive. They tasted like they were cooked for a little too long and the meat was getting old.

Sometimes the wait could be more than 30 minutes (we never wait that long but we've seen really long lines of more than 10 people). Once you're in, they are very polite and efficient. However, due to language barriers, they sometimes mix up your order or has trouble with bill splitting.Would go back? Yes, their savoury ramen soup is great for warming up in the winter.

Yes, if they like soup noodles.Similar places: Hokkaido Ramen Santouka, and probably any other ramen store but we've only been to Sansotei and Santouka**Disclaimer: Average cost per diner constitutes the amount (per person) we eat to get full without drinks.

While the vast majority of the dishes we tried were in the good to excellent range, there were a couple of misses. The fried chicken was bland and the mayo dipping sauce was pretty boring. In addition, the kimchi udon noodles had about one-quarter of the required amount of kimchi to properly flavour the dish.

Located inside the CN Tower 1150 ft above ground! Elevators are super fast going up and you get to bypass the line for the CN Tower with reservations. Plenty of seating however you want to get one right next to the window for the best views. THE BLACK AND WHITE: I made lunch reservations a week beforehand because most of the night reservations are booked (unless you want the late night view). Needless to say, I think lunch time is better because you can actually take advantage of the view. The restaurant does spin, so be careful when you're looking out, otherwise you might unknowingly hit a pillar.The cool perk about having lunch/dinner at 360 is that it gives you complimentary elevator ride up to the restaurant as well as access to the glass floor and observation deck after your meal. 2 courses are $58 CAD, 3 courses are $72 CAD. Drinks are extra. I got the View From the Top cocktail which showcased the 150th anniversary of Canada while the gf got the okanagan peach. I have to say, hers was alot better than mine for the cost.The bae and I combined the 2 courses: 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, 1 dessert. We ordered a squid avocado toast appetizer. Both of us aren't squid fans but the chunks of squid were huge. The avocado toast was good. It took a lil bit for our entrees to come out. I got the scallops and pork belly, while the bae got risotto. Presentation was really nice, however when it came to taste, everything on my plate tasted way too sweet. The pork fat was melted away and was almost dry. The scallops were overcooked. The bae enjoyed her risotto but it's really hard to mess up risotto. I'd expect something great if I'm paying top dollar for an entree, so that was underwhelming.We finished our meal with the lava cake dessert.

In the end though, the food is delicious and that should be what matters most!The vibe:-The space that the restaurant occupies is incredible. Huge ceilings, beautiful light fixtures and accent pieces, it's a really trendy vibe with plenty of room for bigger groups. Unfortunately, the vibe of much of the crowd was very corporate, understandable given its location, but they're not on my top 5 lists of crowds. The service was attentive, maybe even somewhat obtrusively so. I won't fault them for that though.The drinks:-An intriguing cocktail menu, I ordered the Smokin' Manhattan which had tobacco-infused Rye (basically steeped with a cigar), lovely velvety texture and cigar-like smokiness made it worth the $14. The beer menu was decent but lacking in the stouts or porters I would prefer in the Winter weather. The food:-Started the meal with the Fried Chicken Skins, which was a nice greasy nibble before starting an actual meal. Not sized as an appetizer but delicious nonetheless. I ordered the Octopus/Lobster gumbo and split a Hot Mess with a friend who ordered the Jerk Cornish Hen. Overall, the gumbo had good flavour, and while it was a small portion, there was ample octopus and lobster found within it. The Jerk Hen was nice though I prefer my Jamaican seasoning on the spicier side. The star of the meal was the Hot Mess, a diabolical combination of sweet potato, brisket, sour cream, and cheese curds. Delicious and the brisket had a great smoky flavour that made me wish that I had given the smokepit a shot (I've avoided going full-BBQ since a recent trip to Texas made everything pale in comparison). Ended the meal with a Cheddar Cheese ice cream sandwich. Quite peculiar, it was a cheddar cheese blended ice cream within two wafers topped with parmesan-like cheese. The smell was pretty intensely savoury but the taste was great. I think I liked it? My overall impression:-A trendy, pricey BBQ spot in a neighbourhood that caters to a corporate crowd. The food makes up for any pejorative aspects of those words. The portions are small and that is somewhat against the whole concept of Southern comfort food but it was nice not feeling completely filled to the brim for once.

There are various types of seating at this restaurant including high tables with high chairs, regular tables, and also traditional sitting areas where you have to basically sit on the floor cross legged. If you are picky about how you sit, I would make sure to note this when making resos. The restaurant overall had a very bar/pub like feel and was extremely loud, which was not what I expected at all given the need for resos and the high reviews.

After reading through the Yelp reviews, we ordered the deep fried squash for our appetizer to share - good thing there was four of us because it was a huge stack of food. The best thing that made this dish was the sauce, and I would honestly have never known it was squash as it tasted more like yam or sweet potato. This was my favourite dish. We ordered the massaman curry as that is a regular fav of mine at most curry places, and the pad gra prow. We asked for both to be foreign spicy but they said that they serve the dishes as mild or medium and could give us extra spice on the side. Good thing we did as I actually found the medium quite spicy. I found the pad gra prow underwhelming visually, and the beef in my curry to be actually pretty tough. I expected the beef to be tender and melt in your mouth quality. However, the flavours for both dishes were strong and tastes authentic, and I was happy my curry did not taste watered down as a lot of Thai places do. After being quite satisfied with our meals, we wanted to order dessert. However the staff notified us that they were out of everything..??? Possible on a regular Thursday night?

Indulged here for dinner during Winterlicious 2014! I've never been here before that so I'm not sure how they are on a regular basis with a regular menu. Needless to say, it is on the pricier end. To start off, the ambience and atmosphere is lovely! Really nice for a special occasion - the view more than makes up for the corporate feel of the TD Tower. When we arrived (party of 4 - two couples), our table wasn't ready. They took our coats and suggested we wait in the bar area. That was fine. We grabbed a table and enjoyed the view while sipping on our drinks. They had 4 beers on hand and we ordered one of each. Nothing memorable, the usual Steamwhistle etc. We were then taken to our table about 15 minutes later. We were served an amuse bouche of bread and condiments - tasty but unmemorable. Here is what we ordered: - Butternut Squash Soup - Cured Rainbow Trout- Pork Terrine - Roasted Chicken  - Braised Beef Ribs/Steak - Carrot Cake - Three Milk Cake  (I think) The soup was alright - it tasted something like my mom makes at home; good, but nothing spectacular. The trout was sashimi style. I found the portion rather small, but it was tasty. Again, it didn't stand out for me. My SO was the only one who ordered the pork terrine, and I found it absolutely phenomenal! He said it tasted like fish or SPAM, but I personally loved both the texture and flavour and the accompanying fruity condiments. The roasted chicken was fabulous! I adored every bite - 2 of us got this dish and we both loved it. The chicken was so soft and tender, the sauces were flavourful and complimented the dish well, and the vegetables and I believe wild rice or risotto, were a nice touch. It was perfect! Again, the portion was on the smaller end, but alongside the appetizer, I was getting full by this point. My SO and the other diner got the beef dish. It came with a braised short rib and mashed potatoes. Wow. This dish was out of this world! We all loved the beef and it was done to a perfect medium/medium-rare. The carrot cake was perfect and my only complaint was that I wished the portion was bigger. The cream cheese 'icing'  they served alongside it was absolutely heavenly. My SO got the three milk cake, I believe. I wasn't a huge fan. It wasn't terrible, but it did not stand out to me. Service was flawless - our water glasses were kept full, the servers were gracious and unpretentious. One of them even noticed us trying to take pictures and offered to take one of the group for us! They were friendly and very precise - they cleared our tables with manners and skill. No complaints with them. Presentation was top notch. Everything came looking extremely pretty. Our only complaint was that we wished the portions were a little bigger. The two males in our group noted that they could go for another round of the entrees. I was moderately full - if my dessert had been even 1/2 a size bigger, I would have reached that mark. My other friend, who is a very light eater, was completely satisfied. All in all, I loved my experience at Canoe. I think I would definitely go back to try their regular menu, however, it is quite pricey, so perhaps for a special occasion. The entrees were quite truly amazing, and the desserts satisfying. The appetizers have potential, but could use some work. Maybe we are big eaters or it was simply Winterlicious, but I believe the portions could have been slightly larger. Definitely recommend this place though! ANSWERNOTFOUND",Late review .

With their new location just a block east on Kensington, at least now I'll have to make the effort to walk a block to get my fix. So far I've tried the fish, octopus, and carne asada and they are all equally delicious making it difficult to choose. The new location was easy to spot as I rounded the corner from Baldwin heading south along colourful Kensington due to the people spilling out of the small shop. Everything looks spiffy, including a neat TACO sign behind the counter (see my pic). Eating that carne asada (marinated beef) taco at the new spot gave me an epiphany with a rush going thru my body as I could clearly feel the hot sauce setting off a buzz as I ate it with my eyes closing spontaneously. Absolutely wonderful! The beef had the best flavour that I've experienced in recent memory. And the fresh juice was magnificent. Only $2 for a satisfying glass of fresh mango juice, simply amazing!

Each and every time I have gone I've been very impressed with the décor, ambience, and quality of food while service remained at par. After browsing many reviews online, it became quite evident that this is a chain that does not pride itself on service, especially the Queen St. location which has one of the worst service reps I have ever encountered.  Having said that, let's talk food. The majority of the antipastos are delicious. I always order the carpaccio di manzo, a dish I typically order when I eat out I-tal. The Frittura di Calamari is great as well, a lightly battered deep fried calamari complimented well with lemon.  If you are with a group I highly recommend ordering the Tagliere Mezzo e Mezzo, a selection of Italian/local meats and cheeses. On a few occasions I recall having prosciutto di parma, smoked prosciutto, hot calabrese salami, fontina, smoked scamorza, pecarino, and parm + more, I do believe these are constantly changing day to day. I have not tried a pasta dish at Terroni's that I didn't enjoy. They also carry traditional types of pasta which you don't find everywhere like: Orecchiette, papardelle, garganelli and tagliatelle.  Most of the pastas such as the delicious gnocci are handmade in house, I personally heart the Mezze Maniche al Ragu d'Anatra, a duck ragu with spinach, mascarpone and parm.  As for the pizza, it is truly a-ma-zing, they really do rival Pizzeria Libretto. Terroni's has at least 20 pizzas and really you can't go wrong, even with the basic Margherita or Marinara. This may be attributed to the fact that Terroni's imports and packs they're own tomatos, in addition to making house specialties such as the homemade spicy sausage.  My favourite, like many others is the Smendozzatta pizza: Tomato, mozza, homemade spicy sausage, gorgonzola, and red onions. This pizza is one of my favourite meals, period. It must have to do with the combination of flavour such as the mozza and gorgonzola melting and fusing with the house sausage and caramelizing onions, omg.   Other notable pizzas are the Natalina: Tomato, mozza, roasted red peppers, hot calabrese salami, garlic and olives. C't Mang: White pizza w/ mozza, gorgonzola, fresh pears, speck (smoked prosciutto), walnuts and honey. Quattro Stagiono: Tomato, mozza,  prosciutto di Parma,  eggplant,  zucchini and olives. If you have space for desert, let it be known Terroni's boasts the most popular desert item I have ever come across in my life. I know some girls, including my g/f, who would give up everything for just one bite. The item is a flourless dark chocolate lava cake which is so good that Terroni's could probably stay open just selling that desert. All in all if you're looking for a stand out Italian dinner full of delicious apps, pastas, pizza and a to-die-for desert Terroni's is your spot. Personally I prefer Pizzeria Libretto, but Terroni's is right up there, and open longer than 5pm to 11pm!*be warned, any substitutions are frowned upon ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3066, 3080)",1,0.0,False

We really enjoyed it and was very excited to learn that he had a location here in Toronto. The website let's you book a reservation online, though it doesn't guarantee private seating as they have communal tables and a long counter that wraps around half the restaurant with bar stools. It has a cozy romantic type of atmosphere with dimmed lights. If you sit at the counter along the kitchen, you get to watch the chefs cook and plate some of the dishes. They're efficient and very clean. The servers have always been very polite but not really social when connecting with guests. At times it is confusing to determine who the hostess is as they seem to always be in regular casual clothing (i.e. jeans and shirt). They're quite a popular spot but don't really have a designated waiting area. The building houses the noodle bar on ground floor, the Milk Bar on the second, and they also have a nicer higher end restaurant upstairs which has elevator access.Okay so I didn't really intend to go into so much detail with my thoughts on the actual restaurant. Now, more importantly, THE FOOD! I've been here a couple times now and each visit I was very impressed. Not only is the plating nice but the food on said plate is even better! On my visit a few weeks ago, the menu has changed slightly offering different types of Ramen dishes. I ended up getting their pumpkin Ramen, and I have to be honest, I never really ate or drank anything pumpkin (because I'm not basic haha) and don't really have much of an opinion on it. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I really enjoyed it! It had coconut milk in the broth so it was nice and creamy. It had a delicate flavour, not overpowering. I wasn't a big fan of the hard chunks of pumpkin that was in it but of course it's only because I never really ate it. It was a very interesting twist on Ramen so I liked the variety. We also had the braised beef baos and oh man are they soft and fluffy. The meat just falls apart with every bite and is deliciously coated in a light sauce. The okonomiyaki is really delicious as well. It's all delicious! Will definitely try to come here when I'm in the downtown area. Happy slurping!

To bring this place up a notch - they even served well priced alcohol and have some great shakes and coffee too!So how can you only give them 3 stars says you?  Easy my compadre: It comes down to two facts:1) It has now become incredibly difficult to get a seat at this joint in the evenings in the latter half of the week.  If you show up late - you're not getting in.  Think having your name 4th on the waiting list is great?  Nope - you still end up waiting 2 hours to hear back from them.  But wait.. call ahead!  Great idea!  I call 30 minutes ahead and ask for a table and am told Yeah there's space and you can get a table in 30 minutes - just give me your name.  I get there and... am now on the waiting list and was obviously lied to.  There's no winning here.  2) So what happens if you DO get that highly coveted table?  There's a good chance you'll be sent to the dungeon of Snakes & Lattes... i.e. their basement.  I think it's great that they expanded to fit more people in.  The problem is that their basement is highly undesirable and not conducive to sitting around and having a good time.  It's small, cramped, and uninviting.  I would honestly rather take a board game and play on the sidewalk outside.  I think Snakes & Lattes has a great opportunity with this business.

It's a great place for a fancy date or upscale celebration.  The staff is also top notch.  They are extremely helpful, friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  Their scallops were cooked perfectly and actually renewed my love for them.  The cheese was also a delectable  end.The negatives... I was disappointed with the hamachi ceviche.  I have a huge soft spot for ceviche, and it's pretty much a must order if I see it on the menu.  I felt like it was lacking flavour, and the corn nuts were just weird.  They added a weird, hard crunch that kind of cheapened the dish.  In hindsight, I wish I'd tried the tuna tartare instead.  I'm not sure why, but the impression of this dish just stuck with me, and unfortunately it impacted my overall impression of the restaurant.Perhaps one day I'll have another chance to dine here, and I'll be able to gain a new impression.

But trust me, it's true.When a good friend recommended this place to me and insisted on treating me to a Blaze Pizza, I was immediately skeptical.  I have a pretty strong theory that you can only have 2 out of 3 things from any dining establishment located in close proximity to Dundas Square: 1) Quality  2) Affordability  3) Great customer service.  Well, colour me impressed - Blaze meets and exceeds all 3 criteria. Yes, you really *can* have your cake (or rather, pie) here and eat it too!  On my first visit, I was greeted by the friendliest staff that took the time to efficiently explain to me how Blaze works. A basic rundown: You can get a personal pie that is thin-crust, load it up with unlimited toppings (yes, unlimited! I basically had to pinch myself to make sure I wasn't dreaming) at a set price, and watch it get fast-fired in a large fire oven in 180-ish seconds.The Good: HUGE shout outs to Alca, who deserves a promotion and unlimited pizzas forever and more!  For me, Alca is the face of Blaze Pizza - she's been there every time I've visited (so, a lot), and every time, she greets each customer with patience, enthusiasm and a smile.  She gave me a great impression of the place from the start - it's so refreshing to see someone who genuinely enjoys their job, and Alca brings such warmth to Blaze with her welcoming, upbeat attitude and contagious laughter. She even remembers regulars' names, which, considering the amount of customers Blaze gets, must not be an easy feat!  Big thanks to Alca for being a role model for what every server in Toronto should be like.  When I say Blaze has great customer service, I have Alca in mind. :)  Definitely greet her with a smile the next time you see her - she's awesome!-They don't skimp on their topics. The unlimited toppings here are really high quality, and would usually add up to a lot in any other pizza joint.  From an assortment of fresh veggies and basic ingredients to things like pesto, artichokes, arugala (!), chopped garlic, and cloves of roasted garlic (my favourite), this place has almost everything and something for every palette.  -Blaze is really, really fast.  I sometimes stare in wonder and amazement at the guy blazin' up those pizzas. It's an art, and the man does it with such diligence - I've always had my pizzas from here come out fast, crisp, and perfectly toasted, never burnt or overdone or underdone. They've got it down to a science here!-Unlimited drink refills (which Alca was kind enough to tell me!)  I never thought lemonade could pair well with pizza, but I was wrong. It's a genius pairing.-*TIP*: You can get the best of both worlds if you can't decide between pesto or red sauce!  I like to go half-and-half. You can customize the pie any way you want, so you get to try (and enjoy) a bit of everything.-They have to-go boxes, and unlimited parmesan, hot pepper flakes, and oregano/basil (I can't remember which) on the side for you to grab and load up your pizza with when you sit down.-They also have take-out boxes on the side that you can grab if you choose to have your pizza indoors, and don't finish it! (In that case, though, what's wrong with you...just kidding. I think the whole accessible just-in-case take-out box concept is great and pretty innovative.)The Bad: Sometimes, it can get a little busy and seating can be limited (I've never experienced it personally, but my dad goes regularly during lunch rush hour and tells me this is the case.) My trick is, if you really want a seat and it's too packed at Blaze during lunchtime, take your pie up to the foodcourt in the adjacent building, the floor right below the movie theatres. Grab a drink or something from there, and enjoy. There's usually plenty of seating in the food court and it's just a one minute walk/elevator ride away.The Ugly: Nada.

I saw pictures and thought there's no way this won't be my summer jam. Can't even tell you how broken-hearted/hungry I was after I went. There were definitely positives, but my experience just drowned them all out.Came for lunch at noon yesterday and it all just started sour. Got to the door and the screwface hostess asked how many we were then asked us to wait in line. From the outside we could see the patio and it was maybe 40% full. This isn't King St at midnight; wtf am I doing waiting in line when there are tables? Got through the line and then she asked again how many people. Seated 2 minutes later. The girl who seated us was even less hospitable than the door girl.Sat down and it took about 15-20 mins before anyone came to take our drink order. Again, the place wasn't busy and there was staff everywhere. I ordered the watermelon fire to drink and thankfully it came out quickly and I loved it. Their brunch menu wasn't all that thrilling so I was having a hard time with it. Got the guacamole and nuts for an app and our waitress said everything on the second page was a good portion for one person, so I ordered the mexican corn cakes and my friend ordered the eggs. Guac came out almost immediately by an adorable, personable guy mushing up the avocado in front of us and making it a great app to start with. See? I'm really not just here to complain :)My friend's eggs came almost right away. They were lukewarm and you know when bean dip has been sitting and starts to harden a bit on the outside? That's how his plate came. My food didn't come with his. Isn't it restaurant 101 to serve meals together, especially when it's just two people? I didn't want his food to get even cooler so I told him to start, thinking mine would be out any minute. He finished his meal before my food came out 45 minutes after ordering. My food was seriously the tiiiiiiniest portion, so the claim of good for one person was a joke. The chorizo was old, served on stale corn cakes. I took one bite and was through with the place. We were on a time constraint so when the waitress asked if she could bring me something else, we just asked for the bill. It was a little expensive but I was expecting that for the venue, because it really is gorgeous. Settling the bill took over ten minutes which annoyed me because I just told you I'm on a time crunch and you know I had a shitty meal so why aren't you being more accommodating? Oh, and the bill came to 56, my friend left 70, and the waitress brought back 15 even, so we had no choice but to leave her 10 without seriously stiffing her. So tactless right? It all just felt so Moxie's. Like I was being served by university students trying to make a buck but took no pride in the place. I don't feel like Toronto restaurants understand how CRUCIAL our experience is and how it can all be saved by hiring the right people. Someone mentioned in another review that Toronto's a worldly place and we go everywhere and dine at the best places. Don't spend all this money and make all this effort to make your place beautiful, only to hire staff  who treat us like we don't know any better. Keep the guacamole guy.

A bit steep in terms of pricing but I think it was a good portion and really nice flavors. I believed the kale was steamed, long enough to bring out flavors but not be soggy. There was also a combination dried currants, pine nuts, and lemon. I'd say it was quite robust yet balanced in flavour. Lastly, may I mention they have $1 per oz wines?

I waited to post a review so as not to upset the organizer of the party.I have a number of dietary restrictions due to chronic conditions and allergies.  I am not accustomed to having these restrictions met, and I don't expect them to be met either.  If a restaurant can't accomodate me, that's cool; I just don't eat there.  I don't like to make a big fuss or cause problems for the kitchen staff, so I always call ahead to see what's possible before visiting a new restaurant.  I would like to emphasize again that I understand the risks of dining out with allergies, and I also appreciate that I take a risk every time I do.  I would also like to emphasize that I understand that I am probably a huge pain in the ass to cook for, so I don't expect that every restaurant will be able to do so.  But I always call ahead and check, so as not to cause undue stress or inconvenience for the kitchen staff or for my fellow diners.  And I would never go to a resaturant if they said that I couldn't be accomodated expecting accomodations.Because this was a private function, I contacted the organizer with my concerns, who contacted the staff at Enoteca Sociale a few weeks in advance.  The organizer told me that the staff assured her that it would be fine.When we arrived and were seated, the waiter asked who had the dietary restrictions.  He then went over the information that I had emailed, double checking that they had everything correct.  I felt pretty optimistic that he was so on top of it.  He then assured me Don't worry, you're gonna have lots to eat.Lots to eat turned out to be a teeny salad, a small plate of very basic pasta with tomatoes and garlic (the kind I make at home when I am drunk), and a shot glass of grape sorbet.  Keep in mind that the other members of the party were enjoying a 3-hour, 10 course meal.  I paid the same price as they did, and got 3 miserable courses.  I don't understand why, for example, the kitchen could not have put aside a pile of greens for me before dumping a pile of chicken legs on top for the rest of the party.  Or why it wasn't possible to put some of the olives and preserves from the appetizer tray on another plate that wasn't covered in nuts.  Again, I would like to emphasize that I didn't show up and tell the kitchen my concerns the night of, they knew weeks in advance.  And if it was impossible to accomodate, they should have been upfront about that, and I would have just met up with my friends before or after for drinks instead, no harm done.  I don't expect to be accomodated everywhere, but if you say you can do it, do it properly.  I didn't make a stink the night of, because it wasn't my party, and I didn't want to ruin the evening.  The company and conversation were really lovely, so the evening wasn't a bust.  Enoteca Sociale needs to be upfront about what they can and can't do. This was terrible customer service.

What a way to end the trip! Everything here--the food, the service, and the presentation--was top notch. While we perused the food menu, I ordered the raspberry mojito martini (El Dorado 12-Year rum, fresh raspberries, prosecco, chambord raspberry liqueur, fresh lime, and mint), which was sweet, delicious, and strong. We had a hard time deciding what to order because everything on the menu looked amazing, but we ultimately went with Susur's signature Singaporean style slaw to start, which our server highly recommended (for good reason) followed by cheeseburger spring rolls (smoked chili mayo, pickled veg, lettuce wrap) and a special Ocean to Table platter, which I'll describe below. The slaw came in a beautiful mountain, which they mixed at our table. Once they served it, they removed the remainder to replate before returning it to us. At first, it seemed like the size of the dish was enormous, but it's so tasty and light that we made short work of it--so many great flavors and textures. My boyfriend was the one who ordered the spring rolls, which he said were amazing (I didn't try them for fear of being too full). The seafood platter was basically a sampler that included the following:--*Nova Scotia snow crab meat with avocado, sherry emulsion, fresh dill--Freshly shucked Colville Bay oysters wth sea buckthorne and Asian citrus gelee--PEI smoked slamon with yuzu and marjoram babaganoush, creme fraiche, wild acadian sturgeon caviar on squid ink crostini. --*Fresh scallop ceviche with salted plum and charred jalapeno vinaigrette--*Lobster Thailandaise with green mango and papaya salad, double smoked crispy bacon, cashews, chili and lime, Myogoa ginger flower--Shrimp cocktail with homemade assam horseradish cocktail sauceThe ones I marked with asterisks were my favorites, but all of the items were good. The only false note was the shrimp, which seemed overcooked to the point of being mushy. For dessert, we got the vanilla bean creme brulee (lemongrass, strawberry & gooseberry compote, butterfly pastry) and the signature French and Chinese tong yuen (warm sweet rice dumpling, chocolate nougat, Indian pastry, strawberry, crème brûlée, peach, and rosewater). Both were delicious, but two desserts was probably a little too much.The servers were attentive without being intrusive, they explained every dish as they served it, and they cleaned the table in between each course. Our main server even gave us recommendations about where to find live music after dinner.Not sure I'll ever be in Toronto again, but if I am, I would certainly return here for another memorable meal.

My family has agreed that outside of Italy, Libretto is the best we have ever had (and as a family of pizza-lovers, we have had pizza at many places). It is prepared in the traditional Napoletana-style, seen in the goodness that is the chewy, soft, blistery crusts. Service is friendly and fast as well. I've tried nearly every pizza on the menu (save sausage, anchovie, and salami) at one point or another, and they were consistent in their taste and quality. I am a bit of a traditionalist in the sense that I like a pizza with tomato sauce and melted cheese of some sort, rather than one grated on after the pizza has been cooked. The Nduja sausage and margherita are best for fans of that. The white mushroom pizza is delicious as well. Really, all the pizzas are good. There is something for everyone and the waiters are accomodating with omitting certain ingredients, if you prefer. Not only are the pizzas great, but the appetizer menu is well rounded and perfectly proportioned. The warm olives are a great start to any meal. As for desserts, you can't make many mistakes here. My favourite is the Sfingi. If you like warm, pillowy donuts (and who doesn't?) these are amazing. They've got a beautiful golden crust and when i went were topped with cinnamon sugar and had a nutella filling (it might've been drizzle, I don't quite remember). Either way, they were incredible.Pizzeria Libretto is one of my favourite restaurants in this city. The lunch prixe fixe ($15 for a three course meal) is a great deal and if you love pizza this is a must try. ANSWERNOTFOUND",the best pizza in Toronto,"(11, 36)",2,0.3,False

I made my reservation directly on the website through OpenTable. It was quick and easy. There was a comment box where I put that I wanted to get a dessert with a candle on it for my bf, which was super convenient because I didn't have to tell the waiter on the day of and ruin the surprise.On the day of, I got a confirmation call from Jacobs & Co. The person was super nice over the phone and asked if I wanted to order the dessert in advance so they could get it all ready and we didn't have to look at the dessert menu. This was super efficient and helped reinforce the surprise element (my bf had no idea!) When we got there, we were greeted at the door by a very sweet hostess. The hostess inside walked us upstairs to our table. I was surprised at the beautiful lounge area. There was a pianist and piano bar area and it looked like such a classy place to chill after work or on a Friday evening. I would go back to do this!Our waiter was super knowledgable and friendly. Since we don't know much about steaks, he took the time to explain where each cow came from, what they were feed and how this affects the taste of the steak, and even assessed what we liked, and offered recommendations! We ordered:Bread (free) - warm and buttery goodness!The infamous caesar salad - I was super impressed with the amount of ingredients that was in the salad and that it took the server about 15 minutes to make it in front of us. My only tip for improvement is to indicate on the menu that the salad is spicy because tabasco sauce is added. If I knew this, I would have asked for that to be omitted since I am a weaksauce for spice. We didn't see all the ingredients on her table either. This was a pretty great salad if people like a little kick in their caesar. You can taste each ingredient and the bacon is made with real chunks of pork. 4/5Duck fat fries - you can taste the duck flavour, which was pretty good. 4/5We decided to get two steaks to share so we could try a little bit of each. I loved that they cut it for you so that you don't have to do the work. It's ready to share the moment you get the steaks! We got the Canadian Prime Hereford-Guelph, ON Ribeye 14oz that was aged for 65 days and the A5 Black Tajima-Okinawa Prefecture, Japan, California Cut Striploin 4oz.The japanese Striploin was to die for! It was melt in your mouth delicious. It was honestly like an orgasm in my mouth. I absolutely loved it! It had a sweet taste to it and it was very rich in flavour! A must try! Pricey, but definitely worth the experience. 5/5The ribeye was really tender and juicy. It was pretty fatty to me and to be honest, I was too spoiled by the Striploin to truly think anything else could be better. However, the ribeye was very nicely flavoured and definitely a steak better than ruth chris or the keg, in my opinion. 4/5They also gave us a bunch of sauces, honey goat cheese, and other condiments, but we really didn't need them at all. In fact, we thought the sauces and such ruined the taste of the steak so we didn't use them.2oz Foie Gras - This was pretty delicious and flavourful. I haven't had foie gras in years so I can't really compare, but this was very juicy and tender. 4/5Chocolate Walnut Brownie - this was amazing!!! Rich chocolatey flavour brownie with lots of walnuts. The ice cream was toasted marshmallow, which is pretty unique. There was a long piece of marshmallow, which added to the favour of this dessert. ME LIKIE! 5/5Two chocolate sweets (free) -  a nice touch. if you just wanted a bit of sweetness and don't want to spend on dessert (or you rather get something else for this price) then this is good enough!All of this was followed by the infamous chocolate chip muffins that we got to take home for the next day. They were delicious when we both had it for breakie! Soft and moist!We left super full and then some. The bill came up to around $300 with tax and tip. We didn't get alcohol. Definitely a fine dining restaurant that served its purpose of a special night out to celebrate a special occasion. My bf loved it!This may be TMI, but the following day, my stomach was in knots. I suspect it was the amount of richness and butter that was used to prepare the food. I don't normally eat a lot of butter so it makes sense why I was having gastro issues the next day. My bf was completely fine and woke up still full from the night before!  A fine restaurant that gets you that full - BONUS! ;)Finally, we had leftover ribeye and duck fries that we ate 3 days later. We fried the steak a bit to heat it up and it was STILL as delicious as the day we tried it. The fries were a little soggy, but edible.Overall, I would definitely recommend Jacob and Co for a special occasion or for the steak lovers out there.

He did not give us any explanation on the different cuts. I did see however another table getting to see a board of their different cuts to choose from. The puffs that came out in the beginning were very delicious. I ordered the lobster cobb salad as an appetizer and my boyfriend went with the beef tartar. When our appetizers came out, they had brought my boyfriend the  wrong appetizer (beef carpaccio instead). My salad had nice chunks of lobster and bacon and was great but I think parsley all OVER the entire salad killed it for me (which was not on the desc.)Our mains were good, the steaks we went with were great. Of course we ordered blindly but not disappointed. Steaks what they do well.  The duck fat french fries were AMAZING!! Our server did not come to see if we were doing ok throughout our meal. After our tables was cleaned off, he came to see if we wanted any dessert. He eyed my full wine glass and did not ask at all why I hadn't touched it all night, much less offer another drink! My boyfriend did go on to order me a whiskey sour which was very delicious and made the right way. For dessert, we ordered 3 sorbets and the lemon sorbet was absolutely the best I've had- fresh and made in house. We asked for some things to go and after paying our bill, we waited 10 minutes and still no take out. We only got that after I flagged him down and asked for it.All in all, service was terrible (At least our server) and for an almost $600 dinner I would not consider it worth it.

Hands down the worst restaurant I tried during the event.  The atmosphere inside and the interior is quite nice. The waitress was quite nice and attentive as she could be. It was quite busy.  The chairs were really small and it was hard to put a large winter coat on them. We didn't want to leave our jackets outside the restaurant on these coat racks they had. We were scared anyone could just walk by and steal our expensive jackets. Normally the point of winterlicous is to get people to come to your restaurant and present them with some of your best so them come back. This was hardly the case.  The pre-fix price of $53 for dinner was fair but if I came here normally and had to pay 100$ per person I can imagine i would be super super angry for what I got. The food came super slow but I get it was winterlicous. We had the winterlicous soup to start and it tasted bland and watered down. We also order the french onion soup. It was awful, was so sour and did not have enough cheese. A frozen french onion soup taste better. The steak for the main was so tough at med rare. The fries however were quite good actually. The other was chicken on mash potatoes. The chicken was cooked well and was juicy but the mash potatoes was watery like a soup. For desert we had creme brulee. We kinda had a bad feeling when the table next to us only took one bite. The custard tasted ok but the sugar on top was almost a 1/4inch thick.  Definitely pass on this place and just get a street dog with poutine. Your wallet and taste buds will thank you. The only good thing was free parking for dinner really.

I yelped different types of food in the area and came across this little piece of heaven! We arrived by UBER and were a bit taken aback ( I must admit, I didn't look at very many pictures) as we didn't expect it to be a hole in the wall, type of restaurant. We entered and were promptly greeted with a smile and given a table to sit at. Shortly after sitting down we were entertained by a local man who frequents the establishment. He was a lively character bursting with energy and humor. We checked out the menu and I was slightly disappointed that I didn't see any of the dishes that I associate with Jamaican food - curry chicken/goat and/or pepper steak. Not to worry though, a fan favorite, oxtails, were on the menu. Every time that I've had oxtails I had more fat than meat, so I was a bit skeptical ordering them, but I am so glad that I did! They were absolutely delicious and the meat came right off of the bone and with very little fat attached. The accompanying salad and rice and peas all made for a very tasty meal at an unbeatable price. My friends and I were there for a limited time and opted to take a few rounds of shots (shots, shots, shot, shots...everybody, lol). The woman who primarily helped us was awesome. She made sure that we weren't going to be driving and even dedicated a song to us, Keri Hilson's Pretty Girl Rock. We had a wonderful evening at Under the Table and an incredible meal.

The first time I attempted to have dinner here, I was welcomed to wait 45 mins for the next seat. So knowing that this place was popular and thus good, I was determined to sip the golden curry that I say through the window of khao San road.A couple of days later I returned with optimism and high expectations. It was a weekend and it was lunchtime so the tables were available but still crowded. After sitting down at the bar I immediately liked the atmosphere. It was well-lit, simple and in motion. Servers constantly walked to and fro from the kitchen to the tables. This gave my gf and I a sneak peak of what we could potentially have.My gf settles for paneang curry and I a khao San special egg noodles in coconut curry with braised beef, veggies and fried wonton strips. After a 15 minute wait our food came out in great presentation. It was simple but made each ingredient standout in the dish.Mine was delicious. A sweeter yellow curry withe the most tenderous beef chunks. A thick curry sauce that was perfect for smothering the aged jasmine rice they use here. Apparently the aging gives off a continuous and individual fragrance while in curry. The combination was absolutely ridiculous. My gf received the green curry with chicken and bamboo shoots. A much lighter and thin curry that complimented the rice included very well. My gf especially liked the kafir lime leaves and basil, it made the dish for her.You may be wondering, why I mentioned that she ordered panang curry and then reviewed the green curry. Well, there was a slight mix up in the kitchen, she got the wrong dish. As soon as we had let them know, one of the co-owners was soon beside us to apologize. What a great guy! He offered to pack the first dish up for us and bring out the right dish for free.This guy knows how to service his customers. With such a minor mistake, he made great steps and effort to make it right. I really appreciated that. After we got our third dish, all of the servers were especially kind and accommodating.What did we think of the panang? It was of course also delicious. With the basil and lime leaves again, my gf really liked it. It was a drier curry compared to the green curry which was thinner and soupy. This curry was thick and stuck to the chicken and veg a bit better. Less sauce than both my dish and the green curry, this one was more reminiscent of a stir fry.Overall, out experience here was fantastic. Probably biased by the free meal and opportunity to speak with an owner, the food is honestly great. I haven't had this many types of curry in Toronto ever.

This place was delicious but expensive!! But I definitely indulged in everything I wanted because YOLO!I got a flight of 3 sakes, I'm guessing a 1.5-2 oz. pour of each ($21). Very delicious! I really liked getting the flight because I didn't have to commit to just one! Gotta taste them all! To start, I had the miso soup ($7). It had a nice surprise of mussels. The soup was very flavourful. I saw it had some green onion and enoki mushrooms. Very nice flavours. I won't forget that miso soup! The main course I had was the aburi sashimi selection ($27), where aburi is the style they make things--it uses a blowtorch of some kind so it's slightly cooked on the outside. It was a very nice way to eat it! The fats are caramelized somewhat. Very delicious. There were 8 pieces, 4 different types (so 2 of each). Different raw delicacies including fancy tuna and scallops. I didn't know I would like raw scallops ever, but this place made me realize I do sometimes! Very nice flavours, all pretty unique and well-thought out. Some fresh herb flavours, tanginess, sesame oil at some point... All very tasty!For dessert, one of my friends decided to show up and join me so we split 2 desserts ($13.50 x 2, + $2 for an extra spoon of some unidentifiable round thing with liquid inside). The deconstructed piña colada and yuzu with coconut ice cream was pretty good. I'm normally not a fan of mousse but they did a good job. We also got the green tea dessert. The cakes with that were absolutely delicious! Very flavourful. Caramelly. I didn't taste green tea at all. The ice cream, though, was probably the least impressive thing I ate there. I found that it tasted like if you were to eat a spoonful of matcha powder. The flavour of that wasn't very well incorporated. I've had good matcha lattes made with real, good quality matcha, so I'm pretty sure the ice cream had more potential than that. I also had a 1 oz. dram of the 21-year Nikka whiskey ($15) because I love my whiskey! I'm really into high-quality scotch, and I've tried Japanese whiskey before and liked it so I had to do it.

On one hand, I think the recent proliferation of mega bars (Real Sports, etc.) within walking distance of the Rogers Centre, the ACC, the financial district and the waterfront is a positive for the city, both in terms of tourism and serving the exploding condo neighbourhoods. On the other hand, these massive restaurants often fail in their execution.The BrewHouse certainly gets some things right. The outdoor seating is great, even if most of the tables don't really have any water views to speak of. It's a great summer vibe out there nonetheless. Also, the service was better than I would expect for such a big place.As you might expect, the beer is the real star here. In addition to the mass produced Amsterdam beers that have been available for some time, there are many craft and seasonal beers. It was my first visit, and it was for dinner before a Jays game, so I didn't order anything too adventurous. The Boneshaker is quite good if you're looking for something hoppy. For something lighter and fruitier, the Market Pale Ale is nice.  In terms of food, I had the smoke house burger, which was decent, but the kettle chips that came with it were soggy and almost inedible. We later saw that they had a huge line of kettle chips ready to go out with each order. This type of production-line food preparation, while possibly necessary to serve 500-800ish people, really diminishes quality. In terms of cost, the food isn't outrageously expensive given the location, but don't expect anything amazing.Many have complained about epic lines and wait times, but I'd imagine this will be less of an issue over time. We went on a Friday just before 5PM and got a table for four outside without any wait. We left around 7PM and there were still plenty of inside tables left. I would imagine in the winter months that they plan on attracting more of the local condo residents and those going to events at the ACC to fill the inside, since it's a big space to fill.

I wish I wrote this review earlier, since it has been over a year since I visited The Stockyards.I remember going on a Sunday morning and having to wait close to an hour for counter seating. I vaguely remember it being a cramped and uncomfortable dining experience. But what I do recall vividly is the delicious Fried Chicken and Waffles. I guess it is true what they say about smell/taste being closely associated with memory and emotion. I am from Toronto but lived in Georgia for over 10 years. I've eaten my share of waffles and fried chicken individually, but never together. For the longest time, I viewed the combination as strange and could not imagine it tasting good. Thus I passed up opportunities to eat the dish at famous places like Gladys Knight & Ron's Chicken & Waffles in Atlanta and Roscoe's In LA. Ironically, I tried the combination for the first time at The Stockyards. Who would have thought I would try it for the first time in Canada.The fried chicken is on point. It rivals the fried chicken i've had living down south in Georgia. That's saying a lot, since everything is deep fried in the South. The batter is crispy, light but definitely a little greasy. Don't expect thick crunchy breading or seasoning, since the real focus is on the chicken meat itself. The chicken is tender and incredibly juicy. 3 generous pieces of chicken come with the waffle: 1 leg, 1 breast and 1 drumstick. For $13 bucks, it's a pretty good deal. The waffle is soft, thick and fluffy with a hint of sweetness. It soaks in some of the grease and moisture of the chicken without becoming too soggy or heavy. Overall a decent waffle, but it definitely takes a backseat to the chicken in terms of being the star of the dish. What brings the dish together is the syrup. Described on the menu as chili maple molasses citrus glaze, I will just call it awesome. Without this syrup, I am not sure if the chicken and waffle dish would come together so nicely. It's sweet but also spicy. This kick adds an additional flavor component to the dish and makes eating this chicken an irresistible compulsion. Selling this bottled syrup commercially would make a lot of money. Simply put, the chili maple syrup is the bomb. Anyways, this is definitely a gem of a restaurant in Toronto, where BBQ and American comfort food are generally lacking. I will be back to try their BBQ ribs and burgers.

Don't expect to have a clean plate by the end; the fries are extra crispy, and there are a lot of small pieces (not great for eating with your hands). Also, the crispness of the skin and seasoning makes the skin crumble away with each bite, which is typical of any true fried chicken. Downsides: Coleslaw is very small, not very cold, and plain. Seating is very limited, and the place itself is very small. Fries aren't the greatest. Make sure to ask for extra ketchup and hot sauce because it will be needed.

Instead, there are some fusion-y asian offerings that are decent, but are a bit heavy in flavor which is understandable since they do serve alcohol. Since it is an izakaya place I don't recommend the sushi or sashimi here - I feel that it's never quite as good as if you got it from a real sushi place and this is no exception. Plus it was sort of expensive for my taste. The carbonara udon was quite delicious. I do recommend it. It's best if split among three people or two people with large appetites. The udon is al dente, the carbonara flavor is on point and creamy and it's delicious. The pork belly had a good flavor to it, but I felt it could be a bit more tender and stewed for a longer period. The miso black cod was just so so. I wasn't too impressed with it and have definitely had better. This place is also LOUD. Almost overbearingly so.

We had two different waitresses as they were having their break time, both waitresses were very kind and accommodating. One person dining with me wanted a breakfast plate with bacon and pancakes, it also came with eggs but they didn't eat eggs, so they were kind enough to omit the eggs and provide extra bacon in place of it. Other guests ordered a breakfast burrito, California cheesesteak. They all enjoyed their meals very much. As for my meal (pictures below) - I ordered a Peach Smoothie with the Four Cheese Pasta as my entree and an Oreo Cheesecake to go because I was too full from my meal. The smoothie was delicious, no complaints there. The pasta was good, it's the one dish I would always order in the US. It was slightly dry but once I mixed everything together it was perfect. The portion sizes are very large, when I was finished it barely looked like I ate any pasta as my plate was still full. Even the size of the smoothie, was large. The cheesecake portions are also large. I could barely eat half a piece to myself so definitely think about sharing a slice.

Even more impressive then the view was the timing of each course. Completed to perfection.

My mother was born in Vietnam, though she is of Chinese descent, so I am harder to please since I get the real stuff at home.I ordered a plate of Nem Nuong, which is cured pork that comes with romaine lettuce, vermicelli, basil, and bean sprouts.  It also comes with rice paper.  The fun part is the assembly!  Unfortunately my mother never taught me not to play with my food :p  Vietnamese cuisine is a very hands-on type of food also.

You then dip your roll in Nuoc Mam (fish sauce)For my main I ordere Banh Xeo, which is a Vietnamese crepe that is filled with bean sprouts, mung beans, and shrimp.  This also came with the same accompaniments as the appetizer (save for the rice paper).  You then douse the crepe with fish sauce (yes, fish sauce is to Vietnamese as soy sauce is to Chinese).My other 3 dining companions ended up ordering their preferred versions of pho.  A good bowl of pho rests solely on the flavour and depth in the broth based soup.  I am disappointed to say point blank that the pho broth at the Golden Turtle is nothing spectacular, let alone, deep in flavour.  The chicken strips were tough.  They use the thin variety of rice noodles here.  Verdict:At the end of the day, the damage was $47 after tax and tip.  It is a good place to stop by for something inexpensive and that isn't part of a fast food chain.  However, I did noticed a peculiarity in that the pho noodles took the longest to arrive.  Usually, they appear at your table almost instantly upon placing your order.  However, the reverse seemed true at Rua Vang.  At around 10PM, the place was still pretty busy, but by no means packed.

The first was really good, but second and third went tumbling downhill at an alarming rate.  Yeah, the atmosphere is energetic.  Sure, the open concept kitchen is entertaining.  FINE, the Sake Mojito is highly chuggable.  But, very quickly the food went very sub-par.A year later, I had a dinner to attend at Guu Sakabar in the Annex.  I was not excited.  I ended up pleasantly surprised.1. There was no wait for 4 people (eek!).  2. The space is really impressively designed.  3. It's mandatory shoes-off (in a particular section), which is totally fun. 4. Our endearing server was literally a Japanese anime character.5. The food was, for the most part, really, really delicious.6. It was shockingly grossly affordable ($100+ tip - and we ordered tons).Gomaae is an unexpected standout.  Blanched spinach with sesame sauce sounds like something your Japanese grandmother might make, but there are lots of complex flavours for a simple dish.  Bright green spinach has a hint of bitterness that balances well with sweet-yet-savoury sesame sauce. While I hatehatehate ordering from a Deep Fried section (please call it something that makes me feel less guilty?), I'd recommend Kabocha Korokke (pumpkin croquette) and Ikapiri (calamari).  The croquette is my favourite dish at Guu.  It's texturally interesting, with a crispy exterior and smooth interior.  It's sweet, smoky and savoury all at once.  And, it's smothered in a sauce that's reminiscent of Mac sauce from McDonald's.  While awkward to eat with chopsticks, it's worth the struggle.  The calamari is perfectly crispy and tasty.  It comes coated in sticky ketchupy glaze and finished with a wasabi mayo drizzle.  A bit more heat from the wasabi would have been nice.I lovelovelove raw fish and rare meat, so I found the Cold Dishes to be stellar.  Maguro Tataki, seared tuna sashimi with ponzu and garlic chips is a dream that money can buy.  But, Gyu Carpaccio, seared beef carpaccio with the same garnishes previously mentioned plus the wasabi mayo we saw elsewhere is... Out.  Of.  Control.  The table fought for it, wolfed it down, and contemplated ordering another, but we chickened out.Here's what I would avoid:  Edamame that's predictably standard, Seaweed Salad that's more watery lettuce than seaweed, Gingara, miso-marinated grilled black cod, that's bland, and Kinoko Bibimbap, a vegetarian rice dish, that never became crisp from the sizzling bowl it's served in.The only true complaint I do have was pacing of the meal.  Guu enforces a 2-hour maximum mealtime, but we finished shy of an hour.  Our abundance of dishes could have been more thoughtfully paired, served, and spaced out.  It would have made a huge difference.If you're going to eat at Guu, go to SakaBar in the Annex.  It's also a more mature and diverse crowd, beyond herds of Ryerson students fighting each other with textbooks for octopus balls. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2943, 2957)",1,0.0,False

We showed up a the front of CN tower and lined up to go through to obnoxious security (which I can prove to be useless).

The aged beef served at the restaurant didn't have the aged beef taste that I was hoping for. But, it was super juicy and tender. Grilled close to perfection. - Mussels (appetizer), these were good.

For a few bucks more, you can enjoy your lunch or dinner and sit in for over and hr to get the spectacular view and eat something. Take this for example, if you just go up to the tower and come back down, you still need to spend money on food. Considering a hotdog and soft drink will probably cost you 10CAD. You do the math.

We tried to catch a (any) servers eye but were completely ignored. Eventually one of our party went to the bartender on the patio who came over and announced that they would find someone to seat us - on the almost empty patio. I guess it was not in his job description to seat us. A few minutes later a harried hostess arrived, apologized for the delay and sat us with menu's and the usual server will be right with you speech.  The server - one who had successfully avoided eye contact as we waited at the door, came over promptly with water took a drink order and took a pre-order for some guacamole. On returning with the drinks the menu was kind of halfheartedly explained to us - brunch items individual plates, main menu - smaller portions meant for sharing tapas style etc. The guacamole arrived by a new server who grunted guacamole as he placed it on the table and mixed it in front of us - though he offered no further conversation or menu suggestions.We placed our order:1 BURRITO DE MERISCOS ($19)1 TORTA EL SANTO ($16)1 TACOS PASTOR ($15)1 GRINGA ($14)Now my idea of tapas is a plate with an item in bite size pieces. Not here, while we can't complain about the (unspicy) flavours of the food, the portion sizes were very erratic and not cut for sharing. The Torta El Santo (large portion) arrived on a big bun, it would have been so easy for the kitchen to portion it into 4 before it left the kitchen. The Burrito (large portion) was cut in to 2 pieces. The Tacos arrived as a VERY small plate with 3 measly topped tacos. I have to admit I don't recall what the Gringo looked like - or its portion size, though that in itself tells you something.The service throughout was very lackadaisical, your bothering me kind of way. We weren't offered refills on anything, drinks or water. Trying to catch the servers eye to pay the bill was a joke, I ended up getting up from my seat to ask her.I've been a server in Toronto for over 20 years, eaten around the world and have just returned from Spain, the Tapas capitol of the world.

Settled with a 6:30 pm slot on a Monday evening and although it was relatively busy, you could probably take your chances doing a walk-in on a weekday.Contemporary decor but still had a very classy vibe. Lamb Ribs ($14) - These were delicious but tiny!! 3.5 small lamb ribs (the 4th one was more like a twig with barely any meat) that are tender, mildly flavored with a crispy texture. Not exactly the best value but taste-wise, 4/5  Roasted Red Beets ($13) - I debated whether or not to order this dish pretty much until the very last minute when I decided to just take a leap of faith and trust my fellow Yelpers. So glad I did as it was the highlight of the night. I was hesitant because my boyfriend and I aren't the greatest fan of red beets but you can hardly taste it when mixed with the labneh which had the perfect consistency and creaminess. Served with some delicious barbari bread, this dish is one you don't want to pass up on. 5/5Crispy Squid ($13) - This one was a decent portion but the individual pieces of squid are very small. Lightly fried and the spices and garlic sauce (toum) give it a nice kick. Very flavorful dish overall and tasted great with our rice. Probably one of the least traditional items because frankly, it's basically calamari with some Eastern Mediterranean seasonings. But I wasn't there to judge (nor would I know) how authentic their food was, so 3.5/5 Turkish Manti Dumplings ($14) - I was looking forward to this the most but it ended up being the biggest disappointment of the night. Such a shame. The dumplings were underwhelming to say the least. I actually didn't even know they were filled with eggplant until the fourth one or so because the ones I ate prior had nothing in it. The molasses balanced the yogurt really well but other than that, nothing special. 2/5Tartufata ($30) - Probably the most expensive rice I've ever had.The truffle and mushrooms were decadent and the fried chick peas were amazing. Crispy and flavorful. The rice itself is very ordinary. So all things considered, I can't say it was completely worth it. I wouldn't order it again because I'd like to try their other rice offerings which looked and sounded just as appealing. 4/5Seared Cauliflower ($8) - It's considered to be a side so I'd recommend ordering this with one of their meat dishes (ribeye, lamb shoulder, etc.) because I think it'd compliment it quite well. We just thought cauliflower with duck fat sounded awesome so we couldn't resist and ordered it anyway. I prefer stronger flavors so I loved this but heads up it can be a bit heavy. 4/5As for dessert, we had the Loukmades ($12) - Fantastic! We were pretty full and while waiting, we kept negotiating how many bites each person would take to finish it. Ended up fighting over the last piece. Pretty much burnt honey icecream on a krispy kreme donut (but a different shape). So good and a must-order!! 5/5  Service was lackluster.  Our server was kind and filled our water pretty often but eventually disappeared. We found ourselves waiting a lot - to order dessert, to ask for the bill and to pay. Service shouldn't end after the customer finishes their main course but rather when they walk out the door. Also, typical of many high-end restaurants, they explain what's in every dish but it was spewed out so quickly that a lot of it was incoherent. Didn't really add any value to our dinner.  A little overhyped but I'd come back because their menu still has a few other interesting items I'd like to try. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone who's looking to celebrate a special occasion or somewhere nice to go for a first date. Just don't expect to be blown away.

When I took the matcha cheesecake out of the box to see it, It was extremely cracked and broken, and I could see the insides were still wet. It was VERY undercooked and I can't believe they actually packaged it and gave it to me! Luckily I was still in the shop so I asked for another one.  The girl working in front apologized and gave me another cake quickly. I checked it again and it looked okay.  The shape of the cake was definitely not as round and raised as the original one,  but I let that pass.  Fast forward to when I got home. I let it sit in the fridge for a couple of hours and then took it out to cut and eat. The cake fell apart while I was cutting it, unlike the clean cut with the original cake. The taste was pretty good, it has a Japanese  cheesecake taste with a punch of matcha, but the texture was off. It was still a bit too wet and slightly undercooked. I think the batch that they made today was just taken out of the oven too fast.  Or maybe the matcha flavour is known to be more wet... Someone please offer some insight here. My review on the matcha red bean madeleine : it was great!  Texture was on point and the red bean really compliments the taste of matcha! The matcha soft serve: I expected it to be more on the creamy side... It seemed more like a sorbet to me. The taste was eh. It's too water based for me. From my experience, the original uncle tetsu seems more consistent with their cakes.  I really want to give the matcha cheesecake another shot, just because I've heard that people like the matcha cheesecake more than the original. Maybe today was just bad luck.

I had read some other reviews raving about how good the brunch was but unfortunately, I felt like their dinner menu fell short. I order the streak frites and requested the steak to be medium rare. My fiancé had the pulled chicken sandwich and frites.The steak was cooked well but I found the Japanese Inspired Steak Sauce to just taste like onion and ended up scraping the lumpy sauce off the steak. Initially the fries were quite tasty with a seasoning on them but as I ate my dinner there were quite a few burnt/extremely well-done fries in the middle of the pile. I also found the fries at the bottom of the pile to be soggy.  I was also disappointed that there was no vegetable accompaniment to the meal and if I wanted to add a vegetable there were addition costs. My boyfriend was satisfied with his meal but felt the same about the fries and their varied doneness.The atmosphere of the restaurant was interesting, not too loud but the room felt full of conversation. It was not overly busy as we went on a Tuesday night. The art on the wall was interesting to look at.I was slightly disappointed with the seating arrangement as reservations were made for 5, we were seated at a table meant to seat 4 and the waitress pulled a chair from another table that had patrons at it to accommodate the fifth member of our party. I do not understand why the table was not ready when reservations were made. I also did not understand why we were not seated at a larger table. Lastly the table was stuck in the corner of the restaurant.All in all, I would be willing to try the brunch menu since that is what all the rave reviews were about, but I would make sure to have reservations and maybe specify to not be sat in the corner.

We advised her that we ordered the profiterole, not the macaron; she replied, Are you sure?  with no apology. I figured that Anthony punched in the wrong thing.

Yogurt sauce paired perfectly. 5/5Spanish Octopus with fingerling potato + biber chili vinaigrette + preserved lemonCAD$19.00- typical octopus dish.

Walking to Jimmy's for coffee for the last little while, I had been keeping a close look out on when this place would be opened and when it finally did, I hardly waited before stepping into this gorgeous industrial space, will of beautiful lighting, high ceilings and wooden furniture that gives it a rustic, yet comfortable feeling.On my first visit, I came with a friend just for drinks. The hostess and waitress were overly excited and happy.. a little overbearing, i have to say.. I felt like they were forcing their smiles on me. Their menu is large collection of papers pinned to a clipboard so it was difficult locating where the cocktails were... so I asked out server, and she pointed me to the.... GRAPPAS. I'm not an expert with names, concoctions, or Italian, but I know that Grappas are sweet wines, and not cocktails. Good thing I had read Natalie T's reviews and were able to locate her recommendations and made an executive decision to try their ultra strong drink - the one with the orange bitters (can't remember it's name). It was very strong as I had anticipated, though I have to say the size of the cocktail cup was quite small for the price. I also had a negroni americano (campari, vermouth, soda) and I thought it was made very nicely. Everything that came out of the kitchen smelled incredible and I was really excited to come back for the food. We had been sat along the wall with the banquet and I must say that the tables are WAY too close. I can't say I'm a big girl and I could barely squeeze out feeling like I was intruding on the table next to us.On my second visit, I took my BFF here for her birthday dinner (her choice, but I was definitely excited to finally taste what I had been smelling on my first visit). It was around 6:30 and there were probably 5 tables available. Not wanting to sit along the squished banquette tables, we were lucky to get a table on the main centre aisle, although there wasn't a lot of extra breathing room with people walking by and my chair getting banged several times, and people would be bring chairs across the restaurant and I thought that I was going to get hit in the head. Our waiter was very courteous, and very knowledgeable of everything on the menu. We got the escarole salad to start with walnuts, onion and truffle vinaigrette ($9.95). The escarole had a beautiful crunch to it and a lovely scent of truffle with every bite. The walnuts and onion added some punch and bite and I thought it was a lovely start to our meals.For the mains, I got the 3-mushroom parppadelle with truffle paste and light cream - I was told that it would be very mushroomy and I was very excited because I don't eat them very often - portebello, oyster, porcini ($14.95). When it arrived, I was actually disappointed to see that there were hardly any mushroom PIECES (maybe 3 - 4 little ones), but other than that, thee pasta dish contained mushroom shavings that created the overall taste. The dish was very tasty, not overly heavy and a good texture, but can't say I was completely satisfied. The pasta is NOT made in house, but I was told it was fresh.....My bf got the brandzino ($21.95), which the fish is seared in house (making it super fresh). It was recommended by our server so she went with that. I have to say that this dish was very good, with a very evident citrus coating that erupted your taste buds. The sauteed greens were nice and crunchy, and I preferred her dish over mine in the end.We decided to try the desserts because the waiter really did sell them well. Knowing that they were little bites in the size similar to a shot glass, we got the lemon ice and the chocolate fudge brownie with caramel sauce and rock salt. If I had known that it was $3.95 / shot, I would have passed because I didn't think it was worth it at all. The lemon air was pretty much that in a shot glass. I didn't feel like there was any substance to it although there was a very potent lemon taste. Nothing really sat on my tongue as it evaporated in an instant. There were little pieces of lemon jelly that had a lot of flavour, but that was it. The chocolate dessert came in a very cute little jar, but only half full. It was very dense, and lacking caramel sauce. The rock salt was extremely overpowering so if you didn't know (which I didn't) and took very little chocolate in your bite, it would really turn you off.Having been here twice, I was sooooo excited to try their in house made wine. The first time I came, they were out and told me that it would be by the end of the next week. I came two weeks later on my second visit, only to find out that they still did not have any wine and it wouldn't be ready until... the following week. Unfortunately, maybe I'm just going to wait it out and hope that the next time someone suggests to eat here, the wine will be back.Highlight - FOCACCIA BREAD TO START. Delicious!

I never really tried eastern Mediterranean food aside from Greek food but I never tried food from Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, etc so this was really my first time trying this. Byblos primarily focuses on eastern Mediterranean cuisine but they add a Canadian/North American twist to it, which I find pretty cool. Finding this restaurant was definitely interesting. The entrance to the restaurant was an shelter with a small door made out of nylon, canvas, etc. It looked it I was about to enter a club. The restaurant is definitely beautiful. It is clear that they carefully planned out the design and decor of the restaurant. We went on a Monday night and the restaurant is jam packed. I didn't think a restaurant could possibly be full on a Monday night. This is a good sign. Though there were no available tables for our party of three, the hostess told us to just sit at the bar and the bar does serve whatever they have on the full menu. Since we really wanted to try this restaurant, we were down to sit at the bar. The bar is on the second floor (the restaurant has second floors). The bartender/waiter at the bar was really nice and provided great service (5/5 for service). Their menu is also really interesting. There's small dishes, large dishes, rice, sides, and salads. Apparently, in this type of cuisine, it's common to share dishes (similar to the cuisines in Asia). So we ordered: SMALL PLATES: Salmon Kibbeh Nayeh ($18) - Raw salmon, really good. The bread and the salmon paste just complements each other. Duck Kibbeh ($14) - This dish was okay, we barely tasted the duck and tasted mostly the molasses. Don't really recommend this one. Lamb Ribs ($14) - SO GOOD. Highly recommend this one. I have no words to describe this dish either. You'll just die of happiness.  LARGE PLATES: Crispy Squid ($13) - This dish is so good, I cannot even have words to describe it. Really recommend this one. Hands down, the best crispy squid you would've eaten. Turkish Manti Dumplings ($14) - The yogurt sauce completes this dish. Really creamy and well made. I enjoyed this dish a lot.The dishes are really small, so do expect to spend a lot if you really want to get full. Next time, I would order some rice to get full. We skipped on dessert because we didn't feel like spending any more money but I would definitely try the desserts next time.

Yahoo!Now a bit longer version, for those who are curious. This restaurant is a worst part of the best Toronto attraction. It is ridiculously, idiotically expensive. Portions are small and food is far from being delightful. I would not call it crap but it comes close.And for the same amount of money (think hundred per person) you may be able to eat a bliss of a meal down there in the city. Service is not worth mentioning, because it is barely present. Yes, they will bring your food, you darned tourist.There are more expensive rotating restaurants in the tower, for example the one in Moscow. There are more scenic, for example the one in Berlin. There are cozy ones, such  as Atlanta' Sun Dial, or cute ones - like that in the bulge of Calgary tower. What can you possibly forget in the CN Tower' restaurant, except for saving money for the entrance, is beyond my imagination.An honest and sincere word of advice: Buy the regular admission tickets, better bundled for a couple of attractions, and enjoy the beautiful view from the CN tower. Check out the glass floor and walk around the open balcony. Then go down, choose the best restaurant you'll find and enjoy your meal. You will get some marvellous food and gorgeous view for the same price, without wasting your money on 360 Restaurant. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1513, 1527)",1,0.0,False

We started with Pomegrante Mimosas which were delicious. I ordered the Quiche of the Day which was Quiche Lorrene. I make Quiche regularly and order it all the time...it's one of my favourites. This Quiche was out of this world!! And the salad OMG I never thought I would like salad so much, I wish I bought the dressing from inside. My friend had the French Toast which was also amazing, aparently they take all there left over pasteries from the night before rip them up and combined them together to make almost like a bread pudding....bottom line TO DIE FOR.

I loved the soup, it came out over a candle to keep it hot, served with a side of rice. It came with two jumbo shrimp and some onions and mushrooms. You can definitely taste the fish sauce, which I love in Asian cuisines. It was definitely a cozy and super tasty dish. However, I was very disappointed in the service we received from our waitress, and am very displeased to say that the kitchen staff who brought out our food was far more helpful than our actual waitress. We were seated and were waiting for one friend, but we knew what they wanted, so we waited for our waitress to come around to at least order our drinks, but she didnt for 15 mins and we had to flag her down, which she did not seem happy about. My boyfriend had asked her what was on tap, and she rudely replied with What? along with a displeased look. After ordering our drinks, she went off when we wanted to order our food as well, so we gave her a few minutes to punch in orders, tend other tables. We ended up waiting another 10 minutes and had to flag her down again, still seemed unhappy with asking her to take our order. When my friend had noted that he had a peanut allergy and asked if there was any nuts in his dishes, she once again seemed displeased to be asked a question. It took about 20 minutes to receive our food, and some of it was cold, where as the table behind us who had sat down and order after us began receiving their food within 5 minutes of ordering. Not even once during our meal did she ask if our meal was okay or if we wanted more water, we actually had to ask a different staff member to help us out. Another thing I kind of found work inappropriate was what one of the servers was wearing (btw I am in no way shaming this server or have any problems with what she was wearing but in no way do I or many others find it workplace appropriate in a restaurant for families...) but she was wearing a VERY sheer top, without anything under and you could clearly see her nipples, mind you I'm ok with that, but I'm not so sure families with younger children would be okay with that. In the end, we received our bill from our waitress, who yet once again seemed so annoyed with us, we saw that we had a 20% service charge. I'm okay with paying a service charge, since we did have 6 people, but I don't really think that our server deserved the 20% since her coworkers were waiting our table for her. Overall, the food is pretty good, a little bit on the pricier side for the portion you receive but the quality is there, but I don't mind as there aren't many good Thai restaurants in Toronto. i loved the atmosphere and vibe they had going on.

Grabbed a seat at the sushi bar because I felt guilty taking up a table as a solo diner.  Here are my impressions:  Positives:+ambiance-wise, definitely good for dates but can be a tad noisy.  I could barely hear the sushi chef behind the counter, even from sitting at the bar.  +service seemed very quick for a weekend night.  restaurant appeared to be half full.  Negatives:-Menu seemed diverse in that there were non-sushi items available, as well as the usual creative rolls.  However, all of the raw fish (sashimi) bowls were defined as chef's selection.  In my experience, you can get a bowl of raw tuna on rice just about anywhere.  Well, not here at Yuzu.  I asked a waiter what exactly was chef's selection.. he said it was whatever the chef decided.  (duh!)  Not helpful.-I happen to enjoy sea urchin.  It's an expensive delicacy and the menu listed sea urchin as $11 for sashimi or $9 for nigiri (on a slab of rice).  I ordered the nigiri option.  Well, this is where I encountered the Bait 'N Switch!  As I was waiting for the food to arrive, the sushi chef explained to me that the sea urchin is actually not $9.  Apparently the menu refers to an inferior version of sea urchin that is sourced from Vancouver... but coincidentally, they have a better version that is from Japan..  oh, and this better Japanese version costs double the price.  I asked the guy why this wasn't on the menu anywhere..  he said my waiter was supposed to let me know.  Bizarre!  Well, I was really in the mood for sea urchin, so I went with this ultra fancy Japanese version.  Spoiler #1: it was not that special.  Spoiler #2: the price was more than double -- $20.-Wakame salad (seaweed salad) was a joke. Literally the size of a kid's scoop of ice cream.Weirdness:? Ordering was a little bizarre.  as soon as I sat down, a young man came to take my order..  I was puzzled by the chef's selection part (see Negatives above), so I ordered the Wakame salad appetizer and said I'd figure the rest out later.  The guy leaves and then this woman shows up and asks to take my order..  I did not want to cause confusion, so I said, Oh, I already spoke with the other waiter.  She replied, You only ordered the seaweed salad.  How does she know this??  So I gave her the rest of my order.  ? Didn't get a refill on hot tea.  I took that as a sign to leave early.  Overpriced for what you get..  but the rolls weren't bad.  Sea urchin Bait 'N Switch was seriously disappointing.

Servers are often very busy but remain prompt and friendly. If you come here during peak hours, you'll likely find yourseld waiting a bit for a table, but definitely a shorter wait than the Sansotei nearby. The only cons that caused me to take off a star is that the egg does not come with the ramen and has to be added on at an extra charge when the price for the ramen is already quite expensive. After tax and the 20% tip I usually give them, my bowl of ramen with no extra add ons or upgrades comes to around $16 which is definitely on the higher end compared to the other popular chains like sansotei and kinton. Overall, it is still my favourite ramen place because of how good the ramen is (which is an understatement). However I don't come here as frequently as I'd like to because of the price.

Perfect with maple syrup alone or the addition of ice cream.The salmon egg benedict was great too. The side potatoes are like potato fries; they won't occupy much of your stomach but instead giving you a crispy outer layer and hot and soft potato crust.

Every table was filled with  happy looking customers and piled high with platters of oysters. The atmosphere was both busy and boisterous but still cozy and quaint.  We ordered the calamari and chowder to start. My companion and I both agreed it was the best of both we'd  ever had.  The calamari was tender and crispy with a yummy spicy, sweet sauce. We both had the tandoori salmon which was perfectly cooked and presented on a bed of quinoa.

We really enjoyed it and was very excited to learn that he had a location here in Toronto. The website let's you book a reservation online, though it doesn't guarantee private seating as they have communal tables and a long counter that wraps around half the restaurant with bar stools. It has a cozy romantic type of atmosphere with dimmed lights. If you sit at the counter along the kitchen, you get to watch the chefs cook and plate some of the dishes. They're efficient and very clean. The servers have always been very polite but not really social when connecting with guests. At times it is confusing to determine who the hostess is as they seem to always be in regular casual clothing (i.e. jeans and shirt). They're quite a popular spot but don't really have a designated waiting area. The building houses the noodle bar on ground floor, the Milk Bar on the second, and they also have a nicer higher end restaurant upstairs which has elevator access.Okay so I didn't really intend to go into so much detail with my thoughts on the actual restaurant. Now, more importantly, THE FOOD! I've been here a couple times now and each visit I was very impressed. Not only is the plating nice but the food on said plate is even better! On my visit a few weeks ago, the menu has changed slightly offering different types of Ramen dishes. I ended up getting their pumpkin Ramen, and I have to be honest, I never really ate or drank anything pumpkin (because I'm not basic haha) and don't really have much of an opinion on it. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I really enjoyed it! It had coconut milk in the broth so it was nice and creamy. It had a delicate flavour, not overpowering. I wasn't a big fan of the hard chunks of pumpkin that was in it but of course it's only because I never really ate it. It was a very interesting twist on Ramen so I liked the variety. We also had the braised beef baos and oh man are they soft and fluffy. The meat just falls apart with every bite and is deliciously coated in a light sauce. The okonomiyaki is really delicious as well. It's all delicious! Will definitely try to come here when I'm in the downtown area. Happy slurping!

To each their own but this was recommended to us by the waiter and I really liked the red pepper pesto on the side as well when I dipped the tuna in it :)  YUM.DessertMACARON ICE CREAM SANDWICHESHonestly just ordered this one so I could have a birthday message for the birthday boy.  It was really nice that when I included my request in my reservation in Open Table, they remembered and spelt on a message with chocolate & added a candle and everything!  I hear they give complimentary desserts to birthday guests anyway.  The dessert itself.. well, I had better macarons for sure.  The ice cream and sorbet were delish (raspberry sorbet, bailey's ice cream, and vanilla) - but the macarons were a little disappointing.Overall, the ambiance was fantastic and makes the resto very fit for a special occasion.  Especially around the holiday times when the Christmas Market is going on and everything in the distillery is absolutely beautiful.

There's often a line-up, but they recently expanded so the last few times I haven't had to wait, which is great! It's a very casual, energetic vibe and can be quite noisy during busy times, but I don't mind. The service is okay. Not super attentive and sometimes slow, but I know, they're busy, so it's fine. The servers are friendly enough.I can't say anything bad about their Pad Thai - I order it every time. It's probably my favourite Pad Thai in Toronto. The Chiang mai beef noodle soup is great as well. The soup is flavourful with spices and the beef is nice and tender. It's never piping hot though. Same with the tom yum soup with shrimp - it's not steaming hot when it comes out (even though it comes in a metal pot with a candle underneath to keep it warm). But it's delicious.I do wish that Pai had a red or panang curry - curry is my love. They do have a green curry served in a coconut, which is okay but not my favourite. I find the coconut to be a bit gimmicky and I don't really like when I stick my spoon in the coconut and end up scraping off a chunk of coconut meat. I do LOVE their massaman curry, though - the beef and potato chunks are tender and the gravy is delicious. The curry comes with a bowl of rice, which is the perfect vehicle for consuming all of the gravy.I feel happy and satisfied every time I eat here. Always a good experience!

Lightly seared salmon with a nice springy texture. Altho, in retrospect, this is in my mind a very nicely done western dish, not a tasty Japanese dish. There's nothing Japanese about it. The salmon actually looked like ahi tuna. Still, it tasted very good and my hopes remained highThen it all went downhill from there. The pumpkin egg thing was soggy and cheap tasting (Chinese restaurants serve the same sauce on pork chops). The other salmon thing at least tasted unique. With a very interesting mix of textures. You had crunchy, slimy, chewy, springy all at once. Too bad the taste wasn't great. The avocados had 3 tiny shrimp (they say prawn) and while the shrimp had flavor, the avocado was sooooo bland.

It was always a combination of too expensive and too inconvenient that made it a faraway dream. But I took advantage of Winterlicious 2018 to finally give in. Ok. I get it now. I finally see the light.I was surprised to find out that Miku was as fusion-y as it was. You don't get a lot of quality Asian fusion places, especially ones that do sushi/sashimi with the same high standards as really good Japanese restaurants in the city. They've got an extensive alcohol list and unique cocktails for the adventurous. I got the non-alcoholic Ginger Basil Smash, which was a little sour, a little sweet, and very smashing indeed. Despite the higher end dinner price tag of $53, I still believe Miku is one of the best Winterlicious offers out there. Firstly, $53 for a QUALITY 3-course meal is pretty damn good. Don't believe me? Let's break it down: 1) Aburi Sampler Platter - (6 pcs, originally $18) - How special can torched sushi be? Apparently, really special when it comes to Miku. The flavour was stronger than any other Aburi sushi I've had. I contemplated getting more of the torched salmon at regular prices, but I was too full by the end. 2) Bacon Wrapped Beef Tenderloin and Pan Seared Foie Gras Rouge - Not from the regular menu, this was a piece of Winterlicious originality. Everything on the plate tasted amazing, even the brussel sprouts. I can say for certain though that my first bite into the foie gras was the best, most orgasmic bite of the entire meal. It's also pure fatty goose liver goodness so even though you only get 3 small medallions of beef tenderloin, everything together made me quite full. 3) Green Tea Opera - (originally $14.5) - I was more than happy to see their signature dessert on the menu. It's really something special. Rich green tea mousse with crunchy hazelnuts. Served with a tiny scoop of fragrant house-made green tea ice cream. My fiancé had the Japanese Tiramisu. Tasty, but we both agreed the opera was better. Given the prices of the appetizer and dessert, that puts the beef and foie gras dish at $20! Sometimes, you can't even get a liver pâté dish at that price, let alone a whole piece of foie gras. On top of that, everything was cooked and flavoured to perfection.

The meal started off fine, we had an attentive waitress.  One of our friends is anaphylactic to peanut, banana and avocado.  She ordered the Angus burger and told the waitress about her dietary needs.  The waitress assured us that the burger contained none of the allergens and would specifically talk to the kitchen about her allergy.  Then came the food and everything was fine until my friend found a piece of avocado in her burger.  Luckily she didn't eat it, but we were shocked and upset with it.  Especially when we had specifically told them about the allergies. We called our waitress over right away and she was very apologetic about it.  She offered to cover the cost of the burger and asked if my friend would like to order something else.  Honestly at that point, none of us felt like eating anything anymore.  We asked to speak to the manager just to make sure they are aware of the severity of this error.  Our waitress was very helpful and went to look for him immediately.He came and we told him that we just wanted to let him know about the problem.  He offered his apology and to cover the cost of the burger.  We asked him if he checked with the kitchen to see how could this have happened.  His simply said the kitchen was busy.  Yes, I understand the kitchen was busy but that shouldn't be the excuse.  To us he simply wanted to brush us off and not deal with the real issue. Anyway by then my friend started to feel funny and we all decided to leave. The waitress came back to offer dessert on the house, but we didn't want to stay.  Then they came out to give us another burger as a gesture of goodwill...I guess the kitchen felt bad but honestly none of us wanted to take it as we didn't want to be reminded of the burger incident.  However we felt bad in wasting food, so we took it but gave it away.This is the worst birthday lunch. Not because of the food, not because of the error, mostly the way how the manager handled the situation.  I do not recommend this place to anyone.  I give one star because the waitress was good.

It was full bodied and creamy. I found myself tremendously impressed with the food. Medium spicy was fine by the way. Service:This is a bit of a difficult topic. They are very busy and popular. They try their best to accommodate but because of the traffic, I found that while the faces were friendly, it was hard to find my server. Getting drinks or refills was difficult because it's very noisy, and the waiters/waitresses are constantly on the go. Ambience:I love the decor. It's very spacious inside.

I wasn't that hungry at the time I just wanted to try their dessert.

I made our reservation well in advance and showed up prompt at 6:30pm. Although it was a Tuesday night the place was pretty packed. We were greeted by a lovely hostess who led us to our table on the 2nd floor. Our table was located against a grey leather banquet in the left corner. I think this had to be the best table on that level as it was far enough away from the  other 2 adjacent tables and we had the whole corner to ourselves which gave us a great view of the entire floor.The menu here is predominantly mediterranean and served tapas style meant for sharing. Our waiter was really attentive all night long and each dish came out in a timely manner giving us plenty of time to enjoy one before the next course arrived. I also really enjoyed how the waiter would describe everything on plate as they delivered it to us.We started off with the Fig Salad which has to be one of the best salad i've ever had! It was so fresh with bright citrus flavours. I loved the crunch from the roasted pistachios, and the creamy salty bits of Ackawi cheese which was a nice contrast against the sweet figs. There were also notes of cardamom in the salad which was surprising to taste yet it complimented the dish so well.Next came the Lamb Ribs. I absolutely love lamb but have never had the ribs before and these were exquisite! The meat was soo tender, juicy, and flavourful and I adored the contrast of crunchy salty coating.For mains we had to have the Daily Chargrilled Fish which happened to be Red Snapper. The presentation of the snapper was really breath taking. The fish came out whole with head and tail and was nicely deboned. The fish was covered in mixture of herbs and pickled cucumbers with charred lemons on the side. This fish itself was really moist and the abundant coating of herbs gave the sweet flesh another subtle dimension of fresh flavour. For rice we went with the Oxtail Basmati Rice. I loved that the rice was topped with the crunchy fried kale and the chunks of oxtail mixed in was so tender and flavourful. Make sure you give this rice a good mix before serving so you get a little bit of everything mixed in.For a side we chose the Roasted Brussel Sprouts with Halloumi cheese. Again such a unique combination of flavours. The crispy halloumi paired so well with the roasted brussel sprouts drizzled with the creamy yogurt sauce we couldn't get enough of them!Although I was stuffed at this point I couldn't resist trying some some there enticing desserts.The Chocolate Mousse was soo creamy and light and not too sweet. I loved the bits of broken baklava to add some crunch and spots of chocolate sauce on plate to intensify the chocolate flavour.Burnt Honey Ice cream had a wonderful roasted honey flavourful with notes of vanilla and topped with a wedge of sponge toffee on top.Turkish Coffee Ice cream was soo creamy and rich with a chocolate base and notes coffee in the background topped with chocolate shavingsFinally I had a Moroccan Mint Tea to wash it all down which had a mild mint flavour served in glass tumbler piping hot with mint leaves floating on top was the perfect way to end a glorious meal.I can totally see why people are flocking here. This meal will definitely go down in one of my top 10 most memorable meals! The service here is top notch and the flavours are so unique and amazing. Everything is presented so beautifully and plated with care. The servers know what there doing and they play 80s music in the background. What more could you ask for!

Everything was prompt and they kept the tables nice and clean as you ate picking up chop stick wrappers as they walked by with lightening speed. Just the right amount of checking in with you periodically so as to not disturb or be an annoyance. The ambiance was awesome. They played reggae and dancehall music which shot me straight back to bar hopping and high school dances. It forced my girlfriend and I smile and seat dance a little bit!

We had reservations on a Thursday night at 630pm. Once we walked in, our jackets were taken and coat checked, and we were quickly seated. The ambiance great! Our waiter came quickly, was very friendly, and took his time to explain the menu to us as it was our first time there. We started off with Aburi Beef Carpaccio, which was awesome! I loved the shoyu eggs, it was perfectly cooked. The baby green and pear complimented the beef very nicely (although a lot less greens would have been good). The beef carpaccio itself was amazing, it melted in my mouth and was packed with flavour! We then had the Kaisan Soba, which was basically a seafood soba. You can choose to get it mild or spicy. I got it spicy, which I thought was a very nice kick, I didn't find it too spicy. I was surprised with the generous amount of seafood that came with the soba. There were clams, mussles, prawns, scallop and squid. The seafood were all huge, and super fresh. The soba had a very nice texture to it, definitely one of the best soba I've had. Keep in mind this isn't your traditional soba dish though, it seemed a bit more stir fried. Anyways, overall it was super yummy!Miku is known for their Oshi Sushi (aka the blow torch pressed sushi), so I definitely had to try that. I had the salmon and mackerel. Both were amazing! The rice was very sweet and soft. And both the salmon and mackerel were torched perfectly. The salmon sushi came with a small jalapeno on top, which adds a bit of a kick to it. My husband really liked that touch, I personally took it off before eating the sushi. We also ordered the Miku roll, which was to die for. This roll literally melts in your mouth. What I loved the most about it is that there was such a thin layer of rice around the roll, with each bit, I mostly just tasted the salmon and uni and tobiko, which was awesome!!! I would recommend that everyone must try this roll!! Everything was plated beautifully. I thought the price actually quite reasonable for the quality and ambiance of the restaurant.

It was somewhat sweet, with a relatively firm texture (i.e. compared to a custard), the blood flavor was very subtle.  Fine bits of crispy fried onion added texture as well as a bit of salt.  Pear, cubed and stewed, as well as dried thin slices added a pleasant fruitiness and more complementary textures.Suckling-pig belly brado was a bit of a flop: soggy pieces of belly in a boring broth.Tongue with pickled mustard seeds, cornichons, and what I believe was celery.  Very tender, with very mild tongue flavor.  The pickled celery was surprisingly sweet, in a good way that complemented the tongue.Ricotta and brain ravioli with artichoke was kind of boring, though the artichoke did contributed a nice chewy texture and sour flavor.  Ultimately, I blame myself for ordering pasta at charcuterie!Smoked sweetbreads (which were actually lightly battered and fried, perhaps they were smoked earlier!) were served with a white sauce, with potatoes and radish.  They were pretty tasty, consistency was buttery yet firm.For dessert, I had the apple cake with slices of frozen crème fraîche (genius!), caramelized apple, and crumble.  Apple was incorporated in three different forms: cooked apple, apple sauce, and apple confit.  Normally, deconstructed desserts are among my pet peeves, since re-constructing each perfect forkful requires significant effort, which, I feel is the chef's job!  Notwithstanding, this cake was pretty awesome, with great complementary flavors, textures, and temperatures.  I still would have liked it better fully assembled.The service deserves a special mention: they have many servers who replace plates and cutlery with incredible efficiency.

The ginger scallion noodles and the potato dashi ramen had no taste and the pork ramen's broth and the extremely spicy noodles were way over seasoned, especially the latter. We asked the waiter for hot water but they did not have any so she offered extra pork broth as an alternative. That, however, did not help because the broth was sodium in a bowl. Moreover, we were charged for the broth even though it was offered as an alternative for water. The menu was also very confusing. I added Katsu to my noodles, which was $4 extra, but they don't specify which meat it is. I assumed it was going to be pork, since Katsudon is fried pork cutlet over rice, but instead it was chicken, which I do not eat.

My only two main issues were the lack-lustre service and the small food portion. Their food would probably rate a 4, if not for the meagre portions. El Catrin, as a new restaurant in the area, has a lot of potential to develop into a trendy hangout - that's definitely what they're going for. My friends and I came here on Saturday at about 5 p.m. as we were looking for somewhere to catch up and I have just moved in the area. It was really chilly, but the patio is heated, and the ambiance was very upbeat and casual. The servers and hosts were wearing full face paint, which was definitely interesting and makes the experience distinguishable from other tapas restaurants, though they only do this every third Saturday of the month. However, shout outs to our server Evan G. for providing truly memorable inattentive service. I ordered the raw beef on crispy tortilla, which had great, elevated presentation, and a generous helping of the meat. My only suggestion would be the tortilla chips seemed really delicate and it was a very messy eat. I would have preferred the chips to be more stable/sturdy. I also ordered their house sangria, which tasted good, but I was expecting more fruit. We also ordered the Costilla Corta off of the sharing section of their menu, and then kind of just stared out in confusion at the small slab of braised beef short rib in front of us. The meat was very tender and well seasoned and the presentation and plating was impressive, but the portion was really small to be part of their sharing menu. We had another server bring out three different sauces and explained what each one was. We sat there confused looking on at the other tables with chips wondering if those were complimentary or if we had to specifically request them... or just spoon these sauces into our mouths... We eventually asked for the chips ourselves and 30 minutes after sampling our first plate, we were ready to order, but our server Evan was no where to be found. One of my friends mentioned we were looking for our server so we could order more. A host?/staff member said she would find Evan for us, and 15 minutes still no one. We eventually flagged down another server and ordered the grande grac (made with 2 avocados). A staff member made this in front of us, which guaranteed the freshness and was a nice touch. The guac tasted great and was a good spilt between three of us. Evan stopped by (maybe the paint fumes got to him?) and asked us how the guac was. My friends were full at this point, and I wanted to order more. Evan was making helpful recommendations, and I would likely have ordered their tacos and a few more drinks, but I decided to call it quits with the subpar service and frequent disappearing acts and head somewhere else. Anyway, the ambiance is spot on, and you'll likely have a good time.

Gusto 101 is an awesome place to come in the summer time, because they have a patio out front as well as one on the second floor. Two friends and I sat on the front patio, and it was an absolutely lovely experience. Our servers were very friendly, and accomodating when we requested to pull up an extra chair for my friend who joined late. The food is delicious as well, and on my first visit here I had the pleasure of trying the Cavolo Nero (kale salad with currants, toasted pine nuts, parmigiano and lemon vinaigrette), Polipo (grilled octopus), and Mafalde ai Funghi (mushroom pasta.)Cavalo Nero ($13.99): So many people mentioned this dish in their reviews, so I had to try it because I generally do like kale. The salad was very good, it was a fairly large portion and was flavourful - a little bit of sweetness/tartness from the currants, zestiness from the lemon vinagrette, crunch from the pine nuts, and a great savoury flavour from the cheese. That being said, it wasn't a standout dish for me, it was just a kale salad, albeit quite a good one. I thought it was comparable to the kale salad I had once at Moxie's though, and maybe even remembered enjoying that other one a bit more.Polipo ($15.99): This dish I loved, but really wished they would have given us more, especially given the price. The plate really only came with two tentacles, although one of them was a lot larger than the other and could be split into three sizeable pieces. The octopus was grilled to perfection though, and was soft rather than the chewy, rubbery texture I'm used to. It was also wonderfully seasoned, and came with chimichurri and olive tapenade, as well as piquillo puree lemon potatos and fried capers on the side. Everything blended together well to make an absolutely delicious dish - I could have eaten so much more of this.Mafalde ai Funghi ($17.50): I didn't know what to expect from this dish, but ordered it after reading Yelp reviews. Who would have guessed that a dish consisting mostly of mushrooms (and no meat) could taste so good?! First off, the mafalde is a really interesting type of pasta which I don't see around often. They are like long and noodley but also kind of thicker... but anyways the texture of it was the perfect amount of chewiness for me, and the truffle cream sauce was just so good. I can't even wrap my head around it because this dish seems so simple, but really it was fantastic, would highly recommend ordering this! I definitely want to return to Gusto 101 in the future! The food I had was fabulous and left me wanting more, the service was good, the patio was fun and lively and upbeat, and their $1 per oz. wine deal is genius and should be implemented in all restaurants around the city! Makes drinking very affordable, as you can pick however much house red or white wine you want (I got 5 oz. of white for $5.) The only complaint I would have is that it's just not enough food for the price - I literally finished my pasta in about 5 minutes and then wanted a second (or third.... or fourth...) plate.

The dish had a lot of ingredients, all fresh seafood so that was good. Came with one jumbo prawn, one scallop, squid, clams, mussels, mushrooms, tomatoes and mixed with arugula. At first I was slightly confused since it seemed like just seafood and salad (the soba was hiding at the bottom). I really liked the soba noodles - the flavors were there, was slightly spicy which I liked. One thing I would comment is the presentation surprisingly did not appeal to me - when served, the clam shells were opened but you can clearly see the clam meat wasn't even inside the shell - displaying empty shells definitely isn't the greatest. Clams and mussels were dry, the scallop was overcooked - kind of disappointed there was only one prawn and one scallop when the menu stated it in plural. All the seafood actually had no taste (wasn't seasoned). You could tell they were cooked separately and just added on top of the noodles. The seafood and noodles combined was a tasty dish altogether.Miku Roll ($22)Salmon, crab, uni, cucumber, rolled in tobiiko and topped with Miku sauce. I could rarely taste any of the uni. For an 8 piece roll at this price, I would expect to taste a bit more of the ingredients inside, however I found the mayo and Miku sauce overpowering the roll. It was tasty, but nothing special in my opinion. Miku Signature Sushi selection ($36)Chef's selection of specialty nigiri, roll and oshi sushi  - total of 10 pieces. To be honest I was slightly disappointed with this. For chef's selection and at that price, I must say the selection was weak. I was expecting more high end fish - at least a piece of unagi maybe? Or at least tuna.  Of the 10 pieces, 2 were rolls and 2 were oshi sushi - not impressed. Seabream sushi was my favorite. The waiter recommended the Miku and Red Wave roll - had I known this signature sushi selection would have a piece of each, I would not have ordered the Miku roll on the side. Fail on the waiter's side as he knew it was our first time here.Toro sushi (Market price - $10)I love fatty tuna. This was good but I've had better.Green Tea Opera (13.5)I must say, the dessert was one of the best dishes of the night. It was quite a small piece so quite expensive. I personally really like Opera cakes, so having it green tea flavored was definitely a plus - layers of green tea, matcha cream, dark chocolate, and red bean paste with crunchy bits in the middle, yum. A scoop of Matcha icecream was also served on the side.Don't get me wrong I did enjoy the meal.

Case in point, Mill Street Brewery. This brewery is tucked away in the distillery district and comes with a full fledged bar, retail store and restaurant. And guess what street it's on? Mill Street is basically known for it's big 4 beers; the ones sold in the LCBO. These consist of the tankhouse ale, the stock ale, the Belgian wit, and the coffee porter. However, if you go into the actual bar you'll be greeted by a slew of new and seasonal beers that they only have there. These range from your fruit beers to your stouts to your bocks and Oktoberfests. The variety is mezmerizing and delightful. Be sure to wet your whistle with a sample if your not feeling too adventurous. I know I wasn't trying the imperial chocolate stout.  Can't decide?  Try a taster pack. It's basically a couple of the beers in little cups so you can try them all.  I won't go into all the different beers they have because honestly they may not be there the next time I'm back. I'll list my top 3. First we have the cobblestone stout. I've been around the city trying differen stouts and comparing but coming from drinking guinness all the time nothing really pairs up. The cobblestone stout does though. The beer is nitrogen infused so unless guinness wants to release their nitrogen widget patent you won't be seeing thus out of the bar anytime soon. Upon pourig the stout expect the magical cascading that you usually expect to wait for. The head on the stout afterwards isn't as thick as the guinness head, more like the head on a boddington's. The stout tastes rich with hints of walnuts and chocolate. Definitely my favourite. Next we have the stock ale. This beer is a lighter beer similar to a sleemens cream ale (kinda). The stock ale is refreshing and crisp with a nice balanced finish. This one's actually sold in the beer store so be sure to try it out. I actually just picked up two kegs for a party. Yes, we really like it. Narrowing it down to another is kinda hard but i'd have to go with the belgian wit. I'm also a fan of wit beers (wit, wheat, white). The wit is characterized with aromas of corriander and oranges, quite nice on a summer day. I actually was hooked on the wit at luminato one year (mill st is known for sponsoring a slew of events in toronto). The beer is served with a slice of orange to accentuate the flavours in the beer and in my opinion is the best part. After throwing the orange in to soak everthing up it turns into this kinder surprise magical treat at the end of your beer.  This beer is also sold in the beer stores and LCBO. I'd try and pour it out to drink it though cause it's fermented in the bottle and you want to give the bottom a whirl before drinking it. The bar/restaurant is actually very nice. Large and expansive with a view of the distilling tins. I've been to a bunch of gatherings here and with a call ahead it's great for large parties. I can't say very much about the food.  I didn't have it this time and don't remember it from the last timeI was here. Maybe another day.PS  Their imperial chocolate stout has chocolate from soma chocolates across the street in it.

A good mix of chicken, sprouts and everything else evenly throughout. Nothing stood out from it and the foreigner spicy translated to mild. The Gaeng Hunglay was something else though, think curry, but a little sweeter and hints of ginger. I thoroughly enjoyed that dish more then the pad thai Thai cuisine doesn't have a lot of expensive ingredients, the pad thai costs around 15$ and it wasn't special or outstanding enough for me to order it again.

We showed up a the front of CN tower and lined up to go through to obnoxious security (which I can prove to be useless). Took about 5 minutes to pass through the line and another couple minutes for the security to check your stuff. Walked into the lobby and straight up to the reception.

The aged beef served at the restaurant didn't have the aged beef taste that I was hoping for. But, it was super juicy and tender. Grilled close to perfection. - Mussels (appetizer), these were good.

We had to shout through the whole meal. Also, it was hot, sticky and sweaty. I have been to Guu, and have enjoyed it very much, yelling and all. I'm not sure why it seems so much more offensive here, perhaps because it's a smaller space, and therefor a louder volume?I also found the service to be lacking. We were immediately asked what we wanted when we sat down, and we said that we weren't ready, and hadn't had a chance to look at the menu. The waitress nodded, and then proceeded to stand behind us and wait. Very distracting. The meal came quickly, but after that it was impossible to find someone. We had to wave someone down to get a take out container as my friend could not finish her ramen (they charge 50 cents for that), someone to get us the bill, and then again to get someone to take our visa.

We showed up before 11:30 on a Saturday and the place was already filling up, but we were shown to a comfortable booth right by the kitchen almost immediately.I knew what I was going to order before I had even arrived, but we also wanted to try an appetizer. We noticed four different kinds of bruschetta on the menu, so we figured that would be the best bet. We ordered the Tomato & Ricotta Bruschetta, which is advertised as coming with artisanal ricotta, basil & tomatoes on garlicky-rubbed ciabatta.When it arrived about ten minutes later, we were shocked at how small it was. Once we cut it in half, we both received about two (small) bites. Aside from that, the dish simply wasn't that great. The ricotta was fine, but I didn't taste any basil or garlic and the tomatoes were just cherry tomatoes that had been cut in half. An extremely lazy effort that's disastrously overpriced at $9.95.For the main, I ordered Tagliatelle Bolognese, described as Gennaro's original pork & beef Bolognese recipe, slow cooked & served with pangrattato & Parmigiano Reggiano. While we were waiting, I had my eye on the kitchen and I noticed two bowls of pasta sitting there for quite some time and I was silently praying to myself, please don't be our food, please don't be our food, please don't be our food...It was our food.It was served almost 10 minutes after it had been prepared and the dish suffered because of it. The Bolognese sauce itself was pretty tasty, though it was way, way too salty. But the pasta, because the dish had been sitting out so long, had essentially all clumped together and become one big piece. This was especially evident towards the bottom of the bowl, where the pasta had become one oversized chunk of mush. Oh, and the dish wasn't even remotely hot, of course.I'm not sure I understand how it's considered acceptable to serve food that's been sitting out like that.

Each and every time I have gone I've been very impressed with the décor, ambience, and quality of food while service remained at par. After browsing many reviews online, it became quite evident that this is a chain that does not pride itself on service, especially the Queen St. location which has one of the worst service reps I have ever encountered.  Having said that, let's talk food. The majority of the antipastos are delicious. I always order the carpaccio di manzo, a dish I typically order when I eat out I-tal. The Frittura di Calamari is great as well, a lightly battered deep fried calamari complimented well with lemon.  If you are with a group I highly recommend ordering the Tagliere Mezzo e Mezzo, a selection of Italian/local meats and cheeses. On a few occasions I recall having prosciutto di parma, smoked prosciutto, hot calabrese salami, fontina, smoked scamorza, pecarino, and parm + more, I do believe these are constantly changing day to day. I have not tried a pasta dish at Terroni's that I didn't enjoy. They also carry traditional types of pasta which you don't find everywhere like: Orecchiette, papardelle, garganelli and tagliatelle.  Most of the pastas such as the delicious gnocci are handmade in house, I personally heart the Mezze Maniche al Ragu d'Anatra, a duck ragu with spinach, mascarpone and parm.  As for the pizza, it is truly a-ma-zing, they really do rival Pizzeria Libretto. Terroni's has at least 20 pizzas and really you can't go wrong, even with the basic Margherita or Marinara. This may be attributed to the fact that Terroni's imports and packs they're own tomatos, in addition to making house specialties such as the homemade spicy sausage.  My favourite, like many others is the Smendozzatta pizza: Tomato, mozza, homemade spicy sausage, gorgonzola, and red onions. This pizza is one of my favourite meals, period. It must have to do with the combination of flavour such as the mozza and gorgonzola melting and fusing with the house sausage and caramelizing onions, omg.   Other notable pizzas are the Natalina: Tomato, mozza, roasted red peppers, hot calabrese salami, garlic and olives. C't Mang: White pizza w/ mozza, gorgonzola, fresh pears, speck (smoked prosciutto), walnuts and honey. Quattro Stagiono: Tomato, mozza,  prosciutto di Parma,  eggplant,  zucchini and olives. If you have space for desert, let it be known Terroni's boasts the most popular desert item I have ever come across in my life. I know some girls, including my g/f, who would give up everything for just one bite. The item is a flourless dark chocolate lava cake which is so good that Terroni's could probably stay open just selling that desert. All in all if you're looking for a stand out Italian dinner full of delicious apps, pastas, pizza and a to-die-for desert Terroni's is your spot. Personally I prefer Pizzeria Libretto, but Terroni's is right up there, and open longer than 5pm to 11pm!*be warned, any substitutions are frowned upon ANSWERNOTFOUND",antipastos are delicious,"(498, 522)",1,1.0,True

It is very clear you will have a fun time here.Of course, good decor means little if the food is not up to snuff. Me and my dining companions had a tasting of various dishes. We were started off with some guacamole and chips, with the avocado smashed at table side. It came with a variety of sauces from mild to hot, and also some crickets in a mild chili oil. The guac was very fresh and tasty, and it was neat to try the crickets which are very rich in protein.The Atun Ahi tuna ceviche - with watermelon, Yucateco mignonette, lime and chives, was light and refreshing. It went well with some chips as well and got the appeitite going.The Esquites were surprisingly good - made with charred corn off the cob, epazote, chiptole aioli and lime. Even though it's in a shot glass, it is a warm dish, and the flavour of the freshly grilled corn with the aioli was amazing! I would say this is a must-get.Sopes de Tinga - pulled chicken chipotle with tomato stew, black bean puree, lettuce, crema fresca, queso cotija on corn flour masa. This was delicious as well and well worth trying.Pescado Nayarit - Grilled beeline snapper that is marinated in chile ancho, served whole and de-boned. Came with corn tortila, avocado and salsa martajada. A great dish if you feel like having some fish tacos.Pollo Almendrado - Chicken supreme in almond sauce, fried plantains, chayote squash, sauteed zucchini. This was my favorite dish of the night. The chicken was prepared perfectly and was moist and tender. It had a nice crispiy skin, and the almond sauce was really delicious with it. Everybody at the table loved it and I would put this on the must-get list as well.For dessert, we had some churros - they were pretty large, and yet very light and airy which are perfect. Easily the best churros I have ever had. We also had the Xocolatl (Mexican mousse, candied confir papaya and almond brittle). Surprisingly the Xocolatl was our least favorite item of the evening, as we were expecting something sweet at the end but it was not that sweet at all.Throughout the night we also had various drinks and they were all quite delicous. We split a pitcher of their margheritas and all drinks were made strong and definitely worth getting.Even though some reviewers have noted that this place is pricey, I really don't think it is considering the location and the environment. I thought items such as the tacos and the chicken mole were pretty on par with most restaurants that are not located in touristy areas.Overall, we enjoyed our night at El Catrin immensely. The food, the welcoming service and the vibe here definitely took my mind off a stressful day, and I would not hesitate to recommend El Catrin to anyone.

People were coming in and out waiting for take out, waiting for tables, watching our food jealously as their stomachs rumbled.We had a table of 8 so we ordered a lot of apps to start.  The shrimp chips were decently crispy with a nice peppery flavour that lingered on the tongue. The squash chips on the other hand were not as flavourful or exciting, very mild and safe; same sauce for both which was a little boring.  Deep fired sweet potato thingies were okay nothing special.  The salad hand rolls were pretty refreshing as I don't usually like these things, but they were so clean and honest I ate more than I wanted.  Was not a huge fan of their coconut milk, mushroom, basil, chicken soup.  To be fair I don't like coconut milk as it's too sweet for my tastes, but there was something extremely bitter in mine and it was completely off putting.  Everyone else at the table loved it, so it might've just been me.The fried tofu was absolutely delicious!  SUPER flavourful, crispy and utterly mouth watering.  Really surprised when I casually tossed one in my mouth.  Might just be the best tofu I've eaten in a restaurant.  Bam.Onto the mains.

We only had to wait 15 minutes so we had a quick beer at a bar close by, came back, and were seated right away. We ordered some Electric Lagers to sip on as we took a peep at the taco selection. We started with two orders each of the baja fish, spicy arbol chicken, beef cheek, and shrimp. We loved all of them and you could really taste the freshness of the ingredients. My boyfriend even enjoyed the beef cheek and he's a guy who is iffy about these sort of things. The spicy arbol chicken was delightfully spicy and the shrimp tacos were great, but the standout for me was the baja fish. The fish was perfectly crispy and the sauce was very tasty. I don't know if it was because I had just gotten over the flu or if the tacos were exceptional, but I could not stop eating. We ordered two more orders of the baja fish and shrimp and then decided to cut ourselves off. We sat at the bar and the bartender taking care of us was absolutely lovely, but I was made uncomfortable by the hostess when we first showed up...like I was not worthy.

So, whenever I learn of a ramen place, I will try my best to go there. This time, it's Kinton Ramen.First of all, the restaurant is very small. It's best if you go by yourself or with a friend. More than that, you'd have to bet your luck to get one of the few (2?) tables in the restaurant. The rest of the seats are facing either the bar or the kitchen. That said, the decor is nice and very Japanese style. (I actually think that the Japanese restaurants in TO are starting to look very much alike in terms of decor, maybe they all use the same interior design company). I ordered Shio Ramen with a rich broth and pork shoulder. Kinton is the first ramen restaurant I tried that allows you to choose how rich your broth is and whether you want pork shoulder or pork belly. I was told that the pork belly is a bit fat so I picked the shoulder instead. The broth is okay but the pork shoulder is excellent. The pork is tender and juicy and it reminds me of the pork I had when I travelled in Japan. The noodles are chewy but a tad firm for my taste. I also ordered Spicy Karaage which turned out to be surprisingly good.

As one of Toronto's best steakhouses you pay a steep price for the quality of beefs that are available (as well as the service...which is a huge part of the dining experience). The restaurant itself is on a side street near the bustle of King/Spadina. Upon entering you feel how upscale and classy the place is. I made reservations for my boyfriend and I a month in advance because we wanted to go somewhere special for Christmas dinner. We arrived 10 mins late but that was not a problem. We were quickly asked if we wanted to check our coats and seated. The restaurant itself was not full but I assume that is because they want to maintain the high quality of service it's customers receive.We ordered two 9oz glasses of the Syrah from France and were given complimentary cheddar poppers. These poppers were amazing...piping hot and delicious (even without the butter). I refrained from eating all of mine just because I wanted to make sure I saved enough room for the main attraction (the steaks!). We also ordered a table side caesar to share which was great as well.For the steaks, we shared two cuts of beef as well as 2 half sides (the duck fat french fried potatoes (which were delicious) as well as the roasted beefsteak tomatoes). We ordered a 18oz bone-in striploin from NE, USA as well as a 6oz tenderloin from Japan (A5 Black Tajima-Gunma Prefecture). You cannot come to this place and not get Wagyu from Japan. It is a must because the quality of the beef is absolutely delicious. With the two different cuts of meat from the different regions of the world, you can taste the difference in quality. The Wagyu from Japan was simply buttery and melt in your mouth while the US striploin had a tougher texture (in comparison). Both steaks were done to medium rare as we requested and the Syrah we had ordered complimented the meat very well. We were both satisfied and full that we did not even bother to order dessert. At the end of the meal we were given petit fours and 2 muffins to bring home. The service at Jacobs and Co is what you would expect from a high-end restaurant. The waiters are attentive and knowledgeable when questions are asked. Tables are wiped after every course and water/wine is refilled if need be (without asking). The staff working there will move out of your way when you are walking past them to make sure you feel important and catered to. I would expect nothing less from a high end restaurant and Jacobs and Co delivered. Great experience overall and my boyfriend and I left feeling satisfied and happy.

When I read another review for Sansotei that claimed that it was even better than my favorite... well, gauntlet thrown! I had to try it.This particular location of Sansotei is right on Dundas Street. Hard to miss, considering how lively everything is around here. It's also really close to practically everything, including Chinatown. The location, however, is very small. It's like a really long rectangular room with mirrors on one side to make it seem bigger than it really is. Even going to the bathroom can be tricky because the door swings into diners and people who may be walking down the aisle (like an airplane). Since it's so small, it also means that it's pretty hard to accommodate kids. I had brought my son, and that made things a bit cramped since without a high chair, he moves around a lot. But no matter - I was not to be deterred!I ordered the Tonkatsu black ramen since it was the closest match to the black garlic tonkatsu that I so enjoy. We also got the gyoza as a side. The food came out quickly, which was good for the customers since there was a long line outside and it was raining! Overall, I enjoyed the ramen very much. The noodles were the perfect texture and quite possibly the best part of the meal. The broth taste was lighter and more subtle than I think would be ideal, but still very tasty. You really can't go wrong with black garlic tonkatsu. The meat was tender and fell apart in my mouth. The gyoza were excellent, with just the right crisp and flavor. I really enjoyed the soft-boiled egg. It did, however, have a piece of egg shell in it.So what's the verdict? As much as I thoroughly enjoyed the meal, my mind still does wander back to San Mateo. However, if I'm in Toronto again, I'll be sure to find myself back at Sansotei for another great meal. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1912, 1926)",2,0.0,False

Other than salmon was in that mix, there were only tamago (sweetened-egg), tofu, imitation crab meat and seaweed.

They are wrong. Although the $2 Banh Mis are a steal, and make for a quick lunch, you are certainly getting what you pay for when you go to Banh Mi Boys. My sandwich came up to $6.77, which was very reasonable for what I got. This place must have an immense amount of pressure to keep their prices down given a) the competition in the areab) the fact that most people who know what a Banh Mi is are used to paying $2 on SpadinaTherefore, the fact that they can offer what they do at this price point is impressive.The Food (Pork Belly Sandwich):- The bread was very fresh, tasty, and was toasted perfectly (not too hard, not too soft)- There was a decent amount of tasty, tender meat. It was a little fatty, but this is to be expected from pork belly- The meat was of good quality; leaps and bounds better than the mystery meat of the classic $2 Banh Mi. - The vegetables were also very fresh, and I enjoyed how there was a pickle in the sandwich which I have never had before- The hot sauce was great as always (I'm a big fan of this sweet hot sauce in Banh Mi sandwiches)- I asked for spicy, and the hot sauce was unevenly distributed with one half being medium and the other half being very hot. This isn't a deal breaker, but just an observation.The atmosphere:- Loved the music they were playing in here. Great old school hip hop playing at good volume- The decor was decent. I liked the lamp shades on the lights- The staff was friendly and helpful.- The cleanliness of the place was pretty poor, and this is why the place gets a 3, instead of the 4 it would have received if it was cleaner. There were discarded napkins and food under every single table, with as many as 10 or more discarded napkins under some tables. The 2 tables that were free had varying degrees of mess on the tables from previous customers. There were no tables whose tops were completely clean. I can understand that some customers are quite messy and that the employees may not have had time to clean up after these people, but given that there was a mess under and on every table indicates to me that staff had not cleaned in while, and did not care about the establishment's general cleanliness. One of my biggest pet peeves at a fast food joint is when the place is this messy, because it makes me feel like I'm eating in a barn.That being said, the food here was great, and I will go back to this place, and change my review if the place cleans itself up.

Plus I was going for lunch with a family so I wasn't planning to drink which defeats the purpose of going to a Pub place. However, I've never been to the Distillery District so I thought I might as well give it a try.The restaurant is very big with a patio outside for seating when the weather is nice. We had to stand around for few minutes until the hostess came and she didn't even greet us properly. This was uncalled for because it wasn't even that busy- plus why have those hostess tables outside when there is so host to guide you in? However, our server was very friendly so that made up for it service wise. The restaurant has high ceiling while gives it a bit of cabin feel- with large screen TVs around this place would be good for large group parties or if you want to drop by for beer.Ordered: PULLED PORK POUTINE - This is from the Appetizer menu but it was pretty big in size, I guess it's because this is a 'pub' style restaurant? It came with too much gravy on top I couldn't even see the fries or the meat underneath. However, underneath all the gravy, there were lots of pulled pork and cheese on top. Pulled pork was soft and chewy with all the gravy goodness. This was tasty with fresh green onion that was added on top- but when it comes to it, I would choose New York fries poutine over this any day.Ordered: MEDIUM WINGS(15) - They have Wings special on Tuesdays so we decided to give it a try. They were 50 cents each. This was SO BAD, it was prob the worst wings I've ever had. The sauce was more sweet than sour- which is weird for hot wings. It was luke warm (kind of cold) and dry. I think they prob used the old wings from the day before and then just heated up the sauce and tossed it. The meat was tough and tasteless, it was just horrible! NEVER AGAIN!!Ordered: FLAT IRON STEAK SANDWICH - This came with fries, coleslaw and a pickle wedge. They cook the steak to your liking so I chose Medium Rare. Caramelized onions inside the sandwich gives it a bit of flavor but the sandwich was overall a little too dry. This def needs some more sauce to balance out the steak in the sandwich with the bread. This was prob the best dish out of 4 if I had to pick one.Ordered: DISTILLERY BURGER - Apparently this is one of their most popular burger so I decided to give it a try. This was another big disappointment. The burger was so dry and the beef patty was tough and over cooked. Coleslaw is just pieces of cabbage and carrot with no sauce or seasoning whatsoever. I wasn't sure what it was suppose to be? more like a salad without dressing? The fries were just mediocre.SUMMARY: I guess the reviews were right- this is more of a drinking place and the food is just mediocre. But these days there are so many restaurants with good selection of alcohol PLUS delicious food so I don't think I will ever go back.*chomp chomp* ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3330, 3344)",3,0.0,False

Some people prefer the noodles to be more chewy, some prefer a more egg-y flavour, some like a flavourful broth and some prefer it light. It's hard for everyone to agree on what's the best ramen shop in the world - my personal favourite is Sansotei, but Santouka is not a bad choice either.I love ramen but I find that I can only eat so much of it before I get tired of the taste. Ramen tends to be a bit too salty for me so after a bowl of it I get enough of the taste and often crave something else to offset the salt - usually it's gyoza but my personal preference is a rice dish, and this is Santouka's advantage over many other ramen shops nearby.You can order a combo of ramen and a rice dish (I recommend the salmon), and the rice helps offset the saltiness of the ramen. The two together in my opinion makes a much better meal overall than just the ramen itself. I also find that I need about 1.5 ramen to feel satiated (don't judge) so the rice usually hits the spot. I do not recommend getting the karameshi though, I did not like it at all. The rest were alright but salmon is definitely #1.Now of course because this is a ramen shop, their ramen has to be given more weight in the review. I think for me, the broth is a little too salty. Yes, I know Shio ramen in the picture literally translates to salt ramen, but I've tried all their broth flavours and they've all been consistently salty. If you like stronger flavours, then this ramen joint should be perfect for you. Other than that though, everything else is pretty spot on.I usually drop by during off-hours but I was craving ramen so badly I came on a Saturday night. I had to wait in a fairly long line but the line moves quicker than you'd expect because ramen really doesn't take long to eat. The service was quick and efficient and they get the job done well. The seating arrangement also doesn't feel crowded even though they do try and squeeze a lot of people in.My one minor critique in terms of service is that they should have the condiments labeled. That red sauce they give you with the gyoza is not vinegar, it's chilli oil. It's impossible to tell from just looking at the bottle.Overall, this is a pretty decent ramen joint that you'd probably be happy with. There's a lot of competition nearby, but in my view they still stand near the top from the rest. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2481, 2495)",1,0.0,False

It is prepared in the traditional Napoletana-style, seen in the goodness that is the chewy, soft, blistery crusts. Service is friendly and fast as well. I've tried nearly every pizza on the menu (save sausage, anchovie, and salami) at one point or another, and they were consistent in their taste and quality. I am a bit of a traditionalist in the sense that I like a pizza with tomato sauce and melted cheese of some sort, rather than one grated on after the pizza has been cooked. The Nduja sausage and margherita are best for fans of that. The white mushroom pizza is delicious as well. Really, all the pizzas are good. There is something for everyone and the waiters are accomodating with omitting certain ingredients, if you prefer. Not only are the pizzas great, but the appetizer menu is well rounded and perfectly proportioned. The warm olives are a great start to any meal. As for desserts, you can't make many mistakes here. My favourite is the Sfingi. If you like warm, pillowy donuts (and who doesn't?) these are amazing. They've got a beautiful golden crust and when i went were topped with cinnamon sugar and had a nutella filling (it might've been drizzle, I don't quite remember).

Although I am new to writing an official review on Yelp, my husband and I are no stranger to frequenting a variety of top restaurants in Toronto and around the world for that matter.  Last night was our first time at Cluny and we were both very excited to try it out.  When we walked in, we were immediately impressed with the quaint French bistro décor and overall feel and ambiance.  Loved the little bakery at the front of the restaurant.  When we arrived, we were not greeted by anyone (restaurant wasn't even busy at this point 6:45 Monday evening), after about 5 mins of standing there looking around, someone that looked like he was one of the Chefs (who happened to be getting something in the stock room/closet, finally said someone will be with you shortly.  We were greeted by the hostess with a less than impressive hello.  After we were seated, it took about 10mins before we were acknowledged by our Waiter for the evening.  Again, was not impressed by his demeanor and lack of interest in us as guest.  We've probably had better service at a local Chain restaurant or a drive thru for that matter!  Our appetizers came relatively quickly (Oysters, Cod balls and Caesar salad).  The Caesar salad was a complete disappointment, perhaps I had high expectations but when you proudly call a dish Cluny Caesar with a price tag of $13+ I would expect a little more than 2 branches of Romaine barely drizzled with dressing and 4-5 chick peas and feta lining the bottom.  We ordered Oysters and when it was  brought to us, the Waitress was trying to explain the different Oysters and said Oh and I forget what this one is called.... Anyway, I don't want to get too lengthy with the review here but all in all I would rate the food quite good (minus the Caesar salad) at this restaurant but the underwhelming service takes this place to a whole new low.  The atmosphere in terms of décor and ambiance were excellent, very reminiscent of a bistro in Paris which is a rare find here.  The service was beyond below average.  Our waiter (middle aged male, appeared quite sloppy if I can be honest) was inattentive, unpleasant and simply unprofessional.  He did not check on us until our dinner was done and did not even utter a Thanks or good bye when we paid the bill.  This is definitely a very poorly managed establishment with very disengaged, unprofessional/untrained staff, you can see it in their demeanor and even the way they are dressed. I think the hostess was wearing running shoes and some other waiters were dressed in black golf shirts or sports bra like gym attire.  I am disappointed because this place has potential.

Lee is not that type of place. This is gastronomy at its finest, and Susur Lee is an internationally known chef that we are fortunate enough to have in Toronto. People who whine about small portions and price and claim the food sucks are absolutely clueless and clearly not familiar with what upscale restaurants like Lee has to offer. Like most I had the Singapore Slaw, which is beyond delicious. I dream about that salad and it has been a while since I have been to Lee. Spectacular. Incredible. Worth every penny. Drinks are incredible so splurge and order a cocktail because it will be unlike anything you have ever tasted before. This place is not a fast food restaurant, your drinks will take some time, maybe longer than your food so relax and get patient. We ordered 6 dishes for 4 people and then dessert, which was enough food for everyone. If you have a food allergy be sure to tell them and they will protect you. I am allergic to shellfish which is very unfortunate in a restaurant like this, but they ensured my food was safe and offered alternative suggestions. If you want to have an excellent dining experience, including tax and tip I would budget about $100 per person. If you like more than 1 cocktail or want to do the suggested wine pairings with each course then you will need a lot more money. It is worth the money if you can afford it. This is not a restaurant you will go to all the time, it is a special occasion and a place you could go once a year and splurge.

The decor is quite interesting and definitely unique, but I felt a bit cluttered and it was quite dark. They could probably use more fabric to break down the noise levels. With glass and tiling everywhere and he vast open space, I think it amplifies the noise level quite a bit. My boyfriend started off with a seafood chowder. I thought the broth base was quite nice and very flavourful. There's quite a variety of seafood in the dish so that was nice to enjoy. I had the swordfish ceviche. I am a sucker for seafood and i love acidity and freshness of ceviches. I was not disappointed with this dish at all. They did an amazing job with the swordfish slices and there's a crispy shrimp cracker to pair it with. I love that the sauce was very acidic and they had some fresh greens over top. There are dollops of guacamole that help break that acidity down and bring a new layer of flavour to each bite. I enjoyed it very much! The mains were not quite as impressive sadly to say. I had the chicken cordon bleu crepe topped with a poached egg which was paired with a very large side of slaw. I really liked the salad and again, the flavouring was on point. The chicken was sadly bland, but mixed with the slaw, crepe, yolk, ham and blue cheese, it was a nice meal. My boyfriend had sirloin which came with brussel sprouts and layered baked/roasted turnip. The vegetable sides were very well caramelized and flavourful. But the steak itself was rather plain and had no seasoning. It seams they do an all star job with the sides but really neglected the proteins. I guess we had different stars to our dishes that night. The desserts were interesting. I had the honey butter cake which tasted like a home made lemon cake I use to make. It was really quite delicious and I loved the cake texture. They put a yogurt gelato on top which brought in some tart flavour. And around the cake they had these lemon custard drops which were tart and I thought paired nicely with the sweet cake. My boyfriend had the tiramisu like cake or truffle chocolate bar. It was topped with some basil I believe, and it tasted quite nice. It was a bit sweet for my taste but that's milk chocolate for you. Service was nice. Our wait for the food was a bit lengthy but not to the point where it would be anything negative. I guess it's worth it because they do take the time to present the food nicely on the plate, and that can affect how it will taste as well. Our server was Alice and she was very attentive and friendly and she was there enough to check up on us but left us our space to enjoy our date night :)I would want to come back and try more of their main menu and brunch as well.

I love seeing him in the middle of the day.We went to the very popular Banh Mi Boys for a quick vietnamese sub lunch (I love my viet sub, especially those available at asian supermarkets)! Banh Mi Boys is famous for its fusion vietnamese sandwiches and we really wanted to see what kind of magic Banh Mi Boys has to offer!  Arriving around 12:30, the restaurant was packed with people lining up to buy food. It took us awhile to find a seat, order the food and wait for them to be ready.We ordered the Kimchi Fries. At first, I was a bit skeptical about how the Kimchi would go with fries, especially when neither of us really like Kimchi b/c of its taste and spiciness.  However, I am surprised to say that they went together like peanut better and jam! I believe that the Kimchi was a modified version; hence, it was not crazy spicy with a reduced taste of the ordinary strong  Kimchi flavour. When mixed with the mayo, it became a very creamy sauce with a hint of kimchi that went harmoniously with the fries! Love it! Also, the fries came with pulled pork which added another dimension of flavour. In our opinion, there were too much pulled pork and we could not finish all of them.Next, we had the braised beef cheek steamed bao. The bun was really really soft, softer than the cha shu bao available at dim sum places. It felt really good at first, both in the hand and in the mouth. However, it was too soft that it quickly absorbed the sauce of the beef cheek and became very soggy. The bun was sort of unbearable when we were half way through... Nevertheless, the beef cheek was flavourful and tender.A trip to Banh Mi boys is not completed without trying their Banh Mi! So We ordered their Five Spice Pork Belly Banh Mi. Unlike the vietnamese sub I always have where the bread is severed cold, Banh Mi Boys' baguette was slightly toasted which I actually like more! The crispiness of the bun echoed with the crispiness of the picked carrots. Pickled carrots is one of the reason why I love viet sub so much and Banh Mi Boys did it just right.  Moreover, they added japanese picked cucumber into their Banh Mi which was a good twist to traditional vietnamese sub. But I think it overpowered the pickled carrots.  On the other hand, JW really liked the pork belly which was very tender because of their generous amount of fat.conclusion: not roasted. Although this conclusion may surprise most of you, I believe that Nguyen Huong vietnamese sandwiches are actually better like I mentioned in this post. I might return to Banh Mi Boys for their kimchi fries but it will not be my first choice for vietnamese sub.

Just be prepared for a big bill! I loved the atmosphere here - it was dimly lit, and had a very romantic ambiance to it.

Definitely one of those once-in-a-while starters since it's almost all fat. I didn't really feel the duck confit was necessary to this dish, but it was tasty.- Steak Tartare - hand cut beef tenderloin, slightly spicy, with classic garni and crouton ($22). The portion of this was huge! It was the same size as an entree size of steak tartare I've had at another restaurant. It was also really delicious. Highly recommended.- Rôti d'Agnea - sirloin of lamb and gigot braisé on parsnip purée, spaghetti squash, rosemary Yukon dumpling and jus de cuisso ($43). This was served medium rare and the lamb was quite tender. I preferred the lamb leg over the braised lamb shank (although my boyfriend preferred the shank). The gnocchi that came with this dish was actually my favourite part (too bad there were only 5 of them). Although this dish was nice, it didn't blow me away. I've had better lamb dishes.- Porcelet de St-Canut  - roast piglet, caillette crêpe, braised belly, salsify and grain mustard jus ($39). We particularly enjoyed the crepe and the braised belly. Super tasty. The roast piglet was my least favourite, but it was still decent. I preferred this pork dish over the lamb.- Galette Pomme et Frangipane - warm apple tart, almond and pâte sucrée with rhubarb confit and beurre noisette ice cream ($11). Although the dish tasted good, I didn't think it was anything special. My favourite part of this dish was the rhubarb confit and ice cream. The tart itself was okay, but I would've expected something better from Auberge. Overall, I enjoyed my experience here, but I preferred the starters more than the mains.

I loved the shoyu eggs, it was perfectly cooked. The baby green and pear complimented the beef very nicely (although a lot less greens would have been good). The beef carpaccio itself was amazing, it melted in my mouth and was packed with flavour! We then had the Kaisan Soba, which was basically a seafood soba. You can choose to get it mild or spicy. I got it spicy, which I thought was a very nice kick, I didn't find it too spicy. I was surprised with the generous amount of seafood that came with the soba. There were clams, mussles, prawns, scallop and squid. The seafood were all huge, and super fresh. The soba had a very nice texture to it, definitely one of the best soba I've had. Keep in mind this isn't your traditional soba dish though, it seemed a bit more stir fried. Anyways, overall it was super yummy!Miku is known for their Oshi Sushi (aka the blow torch pressed sushi), so I definitely had to try that. I had the salmon and mackerel. Both were amazing! The rice was very sweet and soft. And both the salmon and mackerel were torched perfectly. The salmon sushi came with a small jalapeno on top, which adds a bit of a kick to it. My husband really liked that touch, I personally took it off before eating the sushi. We also ordered the Miku roll, which was to die for. This roll literally melts in your mouth. What I loved the most about it is that there was such a thin layer of rice around the roll, with each bit, I mostly just tasted the salmon and uni and tobiko, which was awesome!!!

For the bun, I opted for turkey/chicken sausage with sautéed jalapeños and caramelized onion. I modified my concoction into a hot dog by adding ketchup and grainy mustard. However, I wasn't overly impressed by the sausage. It had decent flavours, but the texture was too dry. The toppings were very tasty though, but I wanted more on my bun.  For the currywvrst, we chose spicy Italian with pork and chili flakes. For me, I preferred the sausage on a bun, and again I found the sausage here overly dry. It was served with two pieces of rye bread, which I didn't enjoy nearly as much as the bun. The overall texture was tough and chewy.

The fries were actually my favouite part of the meal and the maple rosemary dip was quite addictive. That said, I think it is pretty hard to mess up fries too badly.

However each time we chose the dishes we were gently informed that the large dishes we chose were quite tiny so we should rethink our order and would walk away telling us to ponder with our own thoughts. This caused for confusion amongst us because we had changed it up 3 times before we had ordered enough food that the server felt was enough, which ended up being 4 smalls dishes, a rice dish, and 4 large dishes. I almost wish that they wouldn't have suggested otherwise in the first place and made us doubt ourselves multiple times. The food came at a reasonable pace, but everything always felt hindered by the service. At one point we asked for dessert menus and it took nearly 20 minutes and a second reminder before we got the menu. It seemed that they were well aware we wanted the menu but felt that they needed to (slowly!) clear the dishes before we're given the menu. This whole meal took 3 hours because of the service.Ambience: It is a nice clean environment with comfortable seating. The place is dimly lit which was okay but as the sun was setting, it definitely got dimmer. It definitely had a Mediterranean feel when it came to the restaurant and the plates and utensils. It was nice seeing them prepare some of our food and drinks, as some of the prep is visible to the diners. Overall, great setting!Food: To keep this from being longer than it already is, I'm just going to put in one line comments on each dish we ordered. Roasted Red Beets: nice yogurt, soft and juicy beets, excellent dish. Duck Kibbeh: I'm a huge fan now, with the great spices and flavours. Hamachi: I didn't care for it, but at least it tasted fresh. Lamb Ribs: a huge hit with everyone but I can't really comment since I didn't eat it. Chargrilled Cornish Hen: Excellent flavours, so juicy and causing my mouth to water just thinking about it again. Whole Boneless Branzino: It was okay, but nothing memorable to me in terms of flavour. Fried Chicken: I loved it, it was crispy and flavourful and reminded me of southern fried chicken. Yogurt Baked Fluke: I was most looking forward to this dish, but it relied heavily on the yogurt for flavour rather than the fluke. For dessert we had the Pavlova which I found was very tart for me, the Crispy Qatayef which had a strong floral aroma but tasty nonetheless, and the Loukoumades which was alright but the burnt honey ice cream was amazing!I don't know if it was our server, but it seems like other reviews had a much better service than me, so maybe I'll come back soon, especially for the food.

So when I was meeting my sweetie for some Christmas-themed mushiness at Underground Cinema (in the form of Love Actually on the big screen), I was happy to be reminded that the two are very close.  It's fairly non-descript from outside - my guy admitted that he probably wouldn't have given it a chance without my recommendation.  As soon as we walked in we were greeted by three things - the warmth of the grill, the guy staffing the grill, and a menu board.  We quickly made our selections of pulled pork and pork belly, and they were cooked fresh in front of us.  The cook also topped our sandwiches, and was nice enough to make suggestions for the two banh mi virgins in front of him.  I topped my pork belly with pickled carrots, cilantro, kimchi, hot peppers, mayo and lucky sauce.  It was delicious!  Even the bun was great.  The SO and I were both impressed.  For the same price, you could go to Subway - but if you have this as an option, why would you?  Quality meat with interesting flavours and toppings, or blah lunchmeat with your regular toppings on a crappy bun?  Not much of a contest.  As far as atmosphere, there wasn't a lot, but a place like this is for a quick bite not a romantic evening.  For around $5 you can have a filling sandwich prepared fresh, and sit to eat it if you want to.  Considering street meat isn't that much cheaper, I'd say that's a good deal.  I wish there was one closer to me!  All in all, this is amazing value.  A super tasty hot sandwich for a great price, and friendly service.

If you've been to East Asia and was lucky enough to dine on the geographically exclusive durian and tofu flavoured ice cream/gelato, then you have to wiggle your behind over to Kekou!  Kekou manages to banish all elements of geographical boundaries, serving notable flavours, such as durian, almond tofu, Vietnamese coffee, jasmine tea, whiskey green tea, rosewater pistachio, and the list goes on.Many of these dairy goodies are made in-house and none of them have preservatives, stabilizers, food colouring, dextrose, corn syrup, soy lecithin, and etc.  I give this a big thumbs up, because you see too many products out there labeled as frozen dairy desserts rather than desserts made with real milk and cream without all the unpronounceable chemicals and additives. My usual go-to is the durian gelato, which comes to no surprise (re: my name).  This time around, however, I opted for the Rosewater Pistachio gelato and the Almond Tofu gelato, partly because I have been on the rosewater beauty bandwagon for some time now and partly because tofu has always been a great ingredient in East-Asian desserts for as long as I can remember.  Both gelatos had great flavour.  They didn't taste water-downed or too in-your-face.  They tasted very refreshing, actually, so much so that you wouldn't think you were eating anything unhealthy at all!Kekou's staff members are very friendly and are eager to let you sample any of their concoctions during your visit.  Need a cup of joe every morning? Then grab the Vietnamese Coffee.  Love your original bubble tea?  Try the HK Milk Tea or Jasmine Tea.  Need a bit of adult zing in your dessert? Then I highly recommend the Whiskey Green Tea (another personal favourite).  From what I've seen, they rotate their flavours, so sometimes you'll be lucky enough to find the soy bean/kinako gelatos and some other ginger varieties (right now, they have Chocolate Ginger, but I'm not a chocolate fan).  Kekou has been my HG dessert joint since its inception and I think it will remain in this place, even in the face of iHalo Krunch (which has charcoal and ube ice cream), Pablo (Japanese cheese tart master), and the ever-expanding Japanese cheesecake fad.

I didn't really have interest, but the lady wanted to try it out and there were no lineups.We got a full size cheese tart for around $15 and it was about 8.  The texture of the filling is similar to flan or pudding - taste was very light (not eggy or cheesy at all).  Most of the flavour comes from the apricot topping.  The crust was pretty flaky.  Neither of us will try it again - just not a great value proposition (their 'premium' cheese tart is the same size but $25 with a creme brulee topping).Although not the same, Uncle Tetsu is probably their nearest competitor (geographically and figuratively).  I'm not a huge fan of sweets, so I do prefer the more subtle taste and better texture of Tetsu's 'cheesecake' (which I probably won't have again anytime soon either).

I was expecting greatness, but what I got was a small portion of overcooked, dry and flavorless fish and soggy and under seasoned fries for $15.I had the halibut, and being my first time I had it done half and half (half regular batter, half Ms. Vickie's).  The Ms. Vickie's batter is definitely the better of the two, have more crunch and texture, while the regular batter was soft and just not good. The fish wasn't overly oily, which is good, but the fish itself was very dry.  You know how in good fish and chips, the fish will flake apart? That lovely texture that just falls apart in your mouth? Well, this isn't it. The fish was chewy, dry and definitely wasn't seasoned. I ended up throwing a ton of seasoning salt, lemon and tartar sauce on it just to give it some life. Onto the second part of the equation: fries. They sure looked delicious, but again the lack of seasoning hurt the verdict, and the fries were a big soggy to boot.  I'm not trying to be dramatic, but I expected a lot more from a place which has a 4.5 stars average rating on Yelp (which I treat like the bible).It's not many times Yelp will disappoint me, but this was definitely one of them.

The first was really good, but second and third went tumbling downhill at an alarming rate.  Yeah, the atmosphere is energetic.  Sure, the open concept kitchen is entertaining.  FINE, the Sake Mojito is highly chuggable.  But, very quickly the food went very sub-par.A year later, I had a dinner to attend at Guu Sakabar in the Annex.  I was not excited.  I ended up pleasantly surprised.1. There was no wait for 4 people (eek!).  2. The space is really impressively designed.  3. It's mandatory shoes-off (in a particular section), which is totally fun. 4. Our endearing server was literally a Japanese anime character.5. The food was, for the most part, really, really delicious.6. It was shockingly grossly affordable ($100+ tip - and we ordered tons).Gomaae is an unexpected standout.  Blanched spinach with sesame sauce sounds like something your Japanese grandmother might make, but there are lots of complex flavours for a simple dish.  Bright green spinach has a hint of bitterness that balances well with sweet-yet-savoury sesame sauce. While I hatehatehate ordering from a Deep Fried section (please call it something that makes me feel less guilty?), I'd recommend Kabocha Korokke (pumpkin croquette) and Ikapiri (calamari).  The croquette is my favourite dish at Guu.  It's texturally interesting, with a crispy exterior and smooth interior.  It's sweet, smoky and savoury all at once.  And, it's smothered in a sauce that's reminiscent of Mac sauce from McDonald's.  While awkward to eat with chopsticks, it's worth the struggle.  The calamari is perfectly crispy and tasty.  It comes coated in sticky ketchupy glaze and finished with a wasabi mayo drizzle.  A bit more heat from the wasabi would have been nice.I lovelovelove raw fish and rare meat, so I found the Cold Dishes to be stellar.  Maguro Tataki, seared tuna sashimi with ponzu and garlic chips is a dream that money can buy.  But, Gyu Carpaccio, seared beef carpaccio with the same garnishes previously mentioned plus the wasabi mayo we saw elsewhere is... Out.  Of.  Control.  The table fought for it, wolfed it down, and contemplated ordering another, but we chickened out.Here's what I would avoid:  Edamame that's predictably standard, Seaweed Salad that's more watery lettuce than seaweed, Gingara, miso-marinated grilled black cod, that's bland, and Kinoko Bibimbap, a vegetarian rice dish, that never became crisp from the sizzling bowl it's served in.The only true complaint I do have was pacing of the meal.  Guu enforces a 2-hour maximum mealtime, but we finished shy of an hour.  Our abundance of dishes could have been more thoughtfully paired, served, and spaced out.  It would have made a huge difference.If you're going to eat at Guu, go to SakaBar in the Annex.  It's also a more mature and diverse crowd, beyond herds of Ryerson students fighting each other with textbooks for octopus balls.

He was great and definitely made our dining experience all the better for my family and me. He was truly spectacular. The food was delicious too! For the appetizer, we got the Raw Bar option, which I would definitely recommend and was enough to split among our family of 4. It came with 2 different types of oysters, shrimp cocktail, ceviche, and tuna and salmon tartare. For my main, I ordered the duck, which was cooked to a tender and flavorful medium rare.

It was my first visit, and I was excited to try this place which I had heard wonderful things about. My review:Food tasted great but the portioning was way off. I had the beet salad which came with a generous helping of red beets, crème fraîche, fresh grated horseradish, watercress and candied hazelnuts. However, one of my family members is allergic to hazelnuts and did not notice that it was in the menu description when she ordered it as her appetizer. When we asked the waiter if there are in fact hazelnuts, he said he would check with the kitchen. He came back to tell us there are no hazelnuts, only walnuts in the salad. These were clearly not walnuts. The kitchen and staff really should know what allergenic ingredients are going into their dishes. Had we taken his word, she would have eaten the nuts and had a very serious allergic reaction. For the main, I had the short-rib which was deliciously smoky and charred to perfection. The meat was tender and seasoning was on point. The side of beans added a nice tangy sweetness that contrasted well with the savoury beef. Others at my table made the mistake of ordering the trout, which came in a laughable portion measuring about 4x6x0.5. While the skin was crispy and the meat itself was moist and flavourful, the portion really did not justify the $38 set meal price. It also came with just three thin slices of zucchini and a very small crab fritter, smaller than a timbit. If you order the fish, don't come hungry. Finally for dessert, I chose the sticky date pudding with vanilla ice cream. Topped with caramel sauce, it was all a bit too sweet for me, but the portion was generous, and the contrast between creamy cool vanilla bean ice cream paired well with the warm spiced cake. The ginger crumble on top added a nice texture contrast to a dish that was overall soft in texture. The banana tart had a pleasant chocolate cookie crust with just the right thickness, but otherwise was not memorable. The trifle lacked flavour. The restaurant itself is gorgeous. Decked out like an upscale western saloon, it sports dark wood and is decorated with hunting memorabilia. A nice place to hang around for drinks with friends.The service was hit and miss. Our main server was not as attentive with our table as he was with diners who ordered off the regular menu. It bothers me when restaurant staff treat you differently depending on whether you are taking part in Summerlicious or not. I think all paying customers deserve equal treatment. In contrast, the other servers who helped with our table were fantastic. Overall, my food was delicious and most of the service was great, but I am giving two stars because of the hazelnut situation, and because the portioning of the fish dish really did not justify the price.

In the end though, the food is delicious and that should be what matters most!The vibe:-The space that the restaurant occupies is incredible. Huge ceilings, beautiful light fixtures and accent pieces, it's a really trendy vibe with plenty of room for bigger groups. Unfortunately, the vibe of much of the crowd was very corporate, understandable given its location, but they're not on my top 5 lists of crowds. The service was attentive, maybe even somewhat obtrusively so. I won't fault them for that though.The drinks:-An intriguing cocktail menu, I ordered the Smokin' Manhattan which had tobacco-infused Rye (basically steeped with a cigar), lovely velvety texture and cigar-like smokiness made it worth the $14. The beer menu was decent but lacking in the stouts or porters I would prefer in the Winter weather. The food:-Started the meal with the Fried Chicken Skins, which was a nice greasy nibble before starting an actual meal. Not sized as an appetizer but delicious nonetheless. I ordered the Octopus/Lobster gumbo and split a Hot Mess with a friend who ordered the Jerk Cornish Hen. Overall, the gumbo had good flavour, and while it was a small portion, there was ample octopus and lobster found within it. The Jerk Hen was nice though I prefer my Jamaican seasoning on the spicier side. The star of the meal was the Hot Mess, a diabolical combination of sweet potato, brisket, sour cream, and cheese curds. Delicious and the brisket had a great smoky flavour that made me wish that I had given the smokepit a shot (I've avoided going full-BBQ since a recent trip to Texas made everything pale in comparison). Ended the meal with a Cheddar Cheese ice cream sandwich. Quite peculiar, it was a cheddar cheese blended ice cream within two wafers topped with parmesan-like cheese. The smell was pretty intensely savoury but the taste was great. I think I liked it? My overall impression:-A trendy, pricey BBQ spot in a neighbourhood that caters to a corporate crowd. The food makes up for any pejorative aspects of those words. The portions are small and that is somewhat against the whole concept of Southern comfort food but it was nice not feeling completely filled to the brim for once.

My main dish was the cod fish and shrimp, which was alright, but I wish the overall dish was less soupy(?!) because it felt more like an appetizer than an entrée.

Both were so ridiculously delicious I wish I could have had more. There's coleslaw and cabbage in the burger that gives it a good crunch, and a small pickle that goes extremely well with the fried pork. You should try both the chicken and pork to see which one you prefer. The Korean pancake is one of the best I've ever had, the edges were super crispy and the dipping sauce added another dimension to the dish. Be careful about the metal tray it comes on because it can get pretty hot. Tried the ice cream cup afterwards as well - preferred the ube (similar to the taro bbt flavour) over the matcha. They stick in Pocky sticks and serve it over a bed of Rice Krispies. So simple, but so good!They get 5/5 because it's certainly worth a try and I wouldn't hesitate coming back here for another meal.

They apologized and seated us immediately.After a long 1.5 hour wait, we were greeted by a waiter who clearly hates his job and could care less about us - and managed to spill water on my shoes. Fine, whatever. At this point, I just wanted our orders in and our goddamn food because I swear we were ready to pass out from hunger. We got the caeser salad, calamari fritti, full rack of ribs, NY steak, carrot cake and creme brulee. The caeser salad is now just a decorated romaine lettuce half. This is the laziest excuse of a salad ever - you might as well let me make my own. The calamari fritti had a weird burnt taste to it and so did the fries - I'm assuming it's from the oil used to fry these items. My ribs were as good as they always have been - fall off the bone and drenched in BBQ. The steak and mash, however, were served to us cold which is very surprising since it was so busy I didn't think food would be able to get cold. Then dessert came, the creme brulee and the chocolate cake - yupp, chocolate instead of carrot. We were so fed up with how the whole night was going that we didn't tell them about the mistake because it would just be another thing to wait on and probably get disappointed about.Given that we're been here every year for at least once for the past 5 years, and we have loved it every time, this experience was enough to deter us from coming back.

Contrary to what a few other commenters have said, I actually found the portions to be generous. I had the creole shrimp and grit cake to start, and there were at least five huge shrimp on the plate. With an extra side, this could have been a meal in itself! For my entrée I had the pork chop with mashed potatoes and collard greens. The pork chop was HUGE and I found myself unable to finish it. (This is shocking because I have a talent for eating.) As something of a mashed potato fiend, I was a little disappointed with their offering but the collard greens were well-cooked and tasty. I ended the meal with the cheese plate with flatbreads and fruit. Though the cheese was delicious (and award-winning according to the menu!) I found myself wishing I had gotten a real dessert instead. I had a bite of each of the other desserts: the blueberry tartlet, and the cherry soup with chocolate mousse. I would highly recommend the cherry soup and mousse. It had some kind of crunchy bits on top that were so tasty! All in all, I enjoyed the experience.

The dish had a lot of ingredients, all fresh seafood so that was good. Came with one jumbo prawn, one scallop, squid, clams, mussels, mushrooms, tomatoes and mixed with arugula. At first I was slightly confused since it seemed like just seafood and salad (the soba was hiding at the bottom). I really liked the soba noodles - the flavors were there, was slightly spicy which I liked. One thing I would comment is the presentation surprisingly did not appeal to me - when served, the clam shells were opened but you can clearly see the clam meat wasn't even inside the shell - displaying empty shells definitely isn't the greatest. Clams and mussels were dry, the scallop was overcooked - kind of disappointed there was only one prawn and one scallop when the menu stated it in plural. All the seafood actually had no taste (wasn't seasoned). You could tell they were cooked separately and just added on top of the noodles. The seafood and noodles combined was a tasty dish altogether.Miku Roll ($22)Salmon, crab, uni, cucumber, rolled in tobiiko and topped with Miku sauce. I could rarely taste any of the uni. For an 8 piece roll at this price, I would expect to taste a bit more of the ingredients inside, however I found the mayo and Miku sauce overpowering the roll. It was tasty, but nothing special in my opinion. Miku Signature Sushi selection ($36)Chef's selection of specialty nigiri, roll and oshi sushi  - total of 10 pieces. To be honest I was slightly disappointed with this. For chef's selection and at that price, I must say the selection was weak. I was expecting more high end fish - at least a piece of unagi maybe? Or at least tuna.  Of the 10 pieces, 2 were rolls and 2 were oshi sushi - not impressed. Seabream sushi was my favorite. The waiter recommended the Miku and Red Wave roll - had I known this signature sushi selection would have a piece of each, I would not have ordered the Miku roll on the side. Fail on the waiter's side as he knew it was our first time here.Toro sushi (Market price - $10)I love fatty tuna. This was good but I've had better.Green Tea Opera (13.5)I must say, the dessert was one of the best dishes of the night. It was quite a small piece so quite expensive. I personally really like Opera cakes, so having it green tea flavored was definitely a plus - layers of green tea, matcha cream, dark chocolate, and red bean paste with crunchy bits in the middle, yum. A scoop of Matcha icecream was also served on the side.Don't get me wrong I did enjoy the meal.

If it was up to me, I'd be dining here daily but for the time being, it will remain a special occasion establishment. Hopefully not for long! Ruby Watcho is an easygoing restaurant that packs a serious punch. We made 7:30 reservations the night before and it was no problem. Immediately when we came in, we were greeted by an owner, Joey. He was wonderful to talk to, so funny as we got settled in. We ordered a bottle of wine and were asked about any allergies. My roommate disclosed again that she was vegetarian. No meat? No fish? No problem! These guys are not going to turn you away; they're here to help. From start to finish, it was exceptional. Expectations are thrown out the window when a huge plate of salad appears. Reading the menu I was not sure what to anticipate: marinated red and yellow peppers, red watercress, romaine hearts, pecorino, fried capers, candied olives, spiced almonds and a basil vinaigrette. With so many things were happening on one plate, I wasn't sure how it would turn out. This just proves to be another reason why I am not a chef. Lynn has the vision! The salad was fresh and vibrant with that basil dressing. The peppers were a soft and slippery bite. The lettuces were unlike any I've seen before, seemingly straight from the garden, just missing roots. Then the olives, capers and almonds added a salty, spicy, sweet element that made each bite completely different while adding that crunch. As for pecorino cheese, well, you really can't go wrong with the generous shavings. The pace of the meal is nice and steady. They let you take your time and give you the right breaks to digest. So after that heap of salad, we were ready to see what was next. The main meat was a slow roasted leg of lamb with walnut and mint pesto. It was perfectly cooked and juicy, with two streaks of it all for me! The pesto was a great addition, for the minty freshness that complimented it so. Sides were equally up to snuff. Lemon scented fingerling potatoes with thyme were perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, sliced down the middle. Also there was sauteed rapini with a cherry tomato vinaigrette that was mustard-y and delectable, alongside a refreshing cucumber and red onion salad in a goat yogurt dressing. Lynn knows her salads! Next was the cheese course, which oddly enough was what we were most excited for. I mean, I love cheese. It's not every day that someone caters so specifically to my adoring respect for cheese. And yet, here it was: a wedge of comfort cream with an apple herd salad drizzled with truffled honey. As the waiter set it down and described the dish, he shrilled, WHAT DID YOU CALL ME?! and it was hilarious. The whole restaurant and staff can be my truffled honeys. Apple and herbs (dill?) is a pairing that I don't see every day and it was SO good with the cheese. Getting everything on the grilled bread alongside was key and perfect. You would think we'd be bursting at this point but we actually managed to keep it together by only taking one serving for each of the main dishes. Finally, dessert time included a espesso cheesecake with Bailey's caramel sauce. Yes, it was tasted exactly as it sounds AKA amazing. It was a very rich dessert which I could only handle a few bites of but it was wonderful end to the meal that we gladly took home to enjoy later. At this point, we felt like we are best friends with Joey and he tells us we should go visit Lynn Crawford who is actually on site, in her chef gear, helping out here and there in the kitchen. We went over and she could not be any nicer, talking to us for several minutes, asking up about our experience, even school and summer plans.

The place is huge and amazing location, right on the lake front.  The muskoka chairs on the patio are a great touch for people that want to sip beer and watch the world walk or sail by.  But that is where my good experience ended.Visited early on a Friday afternoon, decent sized group with the intention to eat/drink the evening away.  When we arrived and told them how many in our party, the hostess looked offended that we didnt have a reservation (only 6 of us) and that we would ask for a table outside.  Given how early in the day it was, their patio was empty.After being seated (we did get on the patio eventually) we got down to the business of sorting out our beer selections. They have a decent offering and have pre-created some flight recommendations. We tried to order some flights but 1 or more of the flavours were out of stock. We asked if we could just substitute or create our own flights out of what they had available ..... that caused mass confusion and eventually we just gave up and ordered pints of what was available .  Disappointing given the reason we had gone was to taste their various beers.The food was average.  Burgers were large, fris served on the side (in their own cup) with garlic aioli. It might have been good - but none of us tasted it as it had that crusty film on the top that condiments get when sitting out for too long.  A few people ordered sandwiches or appetizers - anyone that didnt order a burger had a LONG wait to get their food.  Getting refills of water, napkins or anything really once the food was served was impossible.  Seeing this wasnt going to be somewhere to stay and drink for the evening we asked for the bill.  I will say they were great to give us seperate bills. the downfall is that their terminals for credit and debit dont work on the patio (something about the brick walls of the restaurant block service).  So settling up  took a good 30 minutes.Noone in our party will be back, which is a huge shame. Amazing potential, amazing location, amazing beer (usually), but poor execution.

Although I should've been a little suspicious when nobody ever said Let's go to El Furniture Warehouse because they have great service! I am just going to start with the postitives. First has got to be the pricing of everything under $5. I mean you can't really go wrong with that since this area is surrounded by students from Highschool and University. The pricing is great for people who don't have tons of money to spend on some places located in the Annex. So that is definitely a great reason to come to this place. In terms of the quality of food.. I mean you get what you pay for. I thought that everything was decently good tasting. I got the Braised Beef Spaghetti, Beet and Goat Cheese Salad and a Mac and Cheese with bacon bits. Overall my favorite dish was the salad, second, Spaghetti and lastly the Mac and cheese. Everything was cooked well.. Nothing burnt or under cooked. Now with my experience. This is what I was so disappointed in the most when I got there. Let me just explain what I experienced  yesterday (Oct 23.14): Around 1PM my boyfriend and I decided to eat at El Furniture Warehouse since many people had recommended me to go. It is close to campus with cheap prices! Since I didn't have to work and it was pretty much a day off it was a great time to go. I thought going for a late lunch would be great. As we walked up to the place I noticed two people looking at the menu.. I guess they were deciding on take out. I notice immediately that it wasn't as busy as I've seen this place at night. Which was great - since we should be seated right away, right? WRONG! My boyfriend and I stood there trying to figure out, since it was our first time there, if it was a self seating place or if we had to wait for someone to have us seated. Finally after about a few minutes staring around awkwardly at each other and the people behind us, who were also waiting to be seated a waitress comes from the back and looks like she is going to get us seated. At first she was going to seat us at a high table that sits two people and across the bar but then she quickly asked us if we preferred to on the upper platform area at a table enough to sit four and we agreed to sit some where more spacious. Now this is something that I always do at every restaurant since I get thirsty quickly I told the waitress as she was about to leave to seat the other people behind us to get us two glasses of water to start. She said yes and continued her way down and sitting the other customers. As my boyfriend and I are deciding to pick what to eat we are looking around about 10 minutes later (maybe longer) still wondering where our water is. Finally I told him to bug another waitress who was wiping down a table near us to grab us water.. She said okay and in about 2 minutes our waitress brought us the water. I mean I would be a lot more understanding if it was extremely busy and if she had to wait for our food to be prepared and cooked but it's just water from a tap.. I couldn't believe we didn't just got our waters right away. I mean we had a girl on our left sitting near us who was seated AFTER we were and got her cocktail almost instantly well before we got our water. I just thought that was ridiculous. Finally when she brought the water we wasted no time to order our food so that we didn't have to wait so long for it to come out like our water. We used the time it took for the water to come out as an indicator as to how long the food would take and boy were we right! We ordered like I mentioned previously: beet salad, Mac and cheese and spaghetti. I think it took about 15-20 minutes for the food to come out. My boyfriend and I were both on our phones and trying to kill the time until our food arrived. When it arrived I was very happy with my selection though. Everything looked great. Until my boyfriend noticed right away on his Mac and cheese that they had forgotten the bacon bits! (Which the waitress actually suggested) Honestly he was so fed up with waiting for everything to come out that he almost didn't want to return it. However I am not like that.. I thought if you're going to suggest something and get your customers wanting to add items to their food then you shouldn't forget it. So it took us almost a few awkward minutes trying to wave a waitress in this not so busy place down. When we told her that she forgot she went Oh yeah I am so sorry about that and quickly went to the back sprinkled some bacon and popped back without dish. This is something I just cannot understand.Why was it that it seemed so busy for the waitress when there wasn't that many customers in the place to begin with. Anyways after all of this waiting game my boyfriend and I ate all of our food quickly and just wanted to get out of there. We paid for our meals I think I came to $18? And we just put a $20 down and left. What a frustrating experience. :(-CL ANSWERNOTFOUND",The pricing is great,"(394, 414)",4,0.75,True

I was also glad to be having something soup-y considering the weather we'd had late last week. On the half-block walk from the car to Santouka, I stepped in a puddle so my feet froze while marinating in street sludge. Soup and noodles to the rescue!The place was tiny and while some people like to dawdle after their meals, I often feel rushed when I see hordes of people lined up at the door and try to eat and just get the eff out. I can't help it..and besides, ramen places aren't meant for people to sit around and kill hours on end.  I never tried Santouka when I was in Japan but I have had it in LA and theirs was DAMN GOOD. They also came in different sizes, whereas the location in Toronto offers only the one size which looked small when it arrived but was actually enough, probably because of the richness of the broth. We both ordered the basic miso ramen and gyoza and a couple of pops (sodas) which come in the old-school bottles--so cute! The ramen bowls are served in individual lacquer trays, which has nothing to do with anything, but I liked it anyway. The soup has that rich density that seems to accompany broths that have been boiling away forever, and you know it's got to be pretty fatty, but that's what makes it so guuuhhhhd~ There were two small pieces of chashu, a swirly odeng, green onion, black mushrooms (or was that seaweed?), and those pickled thingies (I forget what they're called). I didn't realize it doesn't come with the egg but just as well since I don't like it when the yolks are half-runny, even though that's how they're supposed to be. The noodles were springy which was a good sign. There's no question that this chain knows what they're doing. I didn't find anything too unique about the gyoza but I find that's usually the case, just that gyoza and ramen go hand in hand. Service is friendly and cheery, and things move along quickly enough. I noticed a wide age range of Japanese people eating at Santouka the night I was there, which is always a good sign. I had Kenzo at the original location last week and it's not what it used to be, from what I understand. Sadly, I don't really have high expectations of ramen in Toronto but am willing to keep trying the different places that seem to be popping up everywhere. So far I'd say Santouka is one of the better places here, hence the 4* rating, but I think we still have a way to go. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2641, 2655)",1,0.0,False

We were greeted by a lovely hostess who led us to our table on the 2nd floor. Our table was located against a grey leather banquet in the left corner. I think this had to be the best table on that level as it was far enough away from the  other 2 adjacent tables and we had the whole corner to ourselves which gave us a great view of the entire floor.The menu here is predominantly mediterranean and served tapas style meant for sharing.

I also really enjoyed how the waiter would describe everything on plate as they delivered it to us.We started off with the Fig Salad which has to be one of the best salad i've ever had! It was so fresh with bright citrus flavours. I loved the crunch from the roasted pistachios, and the creamy salty bits of Ackawi cheese which was a nice contrast against the sweet figs. There were also notes of cardamom in the salad which was surprising to taste yet it complimented the dish so well.Next came the Lamb Ribs. I absolutely love lamb but have never had the ribs before and these were exquisite! The meat was soo tender, juicy, and flavourful and I adored the contrast of crunchy salty coating.For mains we had to have the Daily Chargrilled Fish which happened to be Red Snapper. The presentation of the snapper was really breath taking. The fish came out whole with head and tail and was nicely deboned. The fish was covered in mixture of herbs and pickled cucumbers with charred lemons on the side. This fish itself was really moist and the abundant coating of herbs gave the sweet flesh another subtle dimension of fresh flavour. For rice we went with the Oxtail Basmati Rice. I loved that the rice was topped with the crunchy fried kale and the chunks of oxtail mixed in was so tender and flavourful. Make sure you give this rice a good mix before serving so you get a little bit of everything mixed in.For a side we chose the Roasted Brussel Sprouts with Halloumi cheese. Again such a unique combination of flavours. The crispy halloumi paired so well with the roasted brussel sprouts drizzled with the creamy yogurt sauce we couldn't get enough of them!Although I was stuffed at this point I couldn't resist trying some some there enticing desserts.The Chocolate Mousse was soo creamy and light and not too sweet.

Different tiers of his restaurant that people dressed from casual to fancy can dine at. I liked the layout and design of this restaurant and how they presented everything within. I had the Corn Ramen and I very much enjoyed it. The chicken was moist and he used the dark meat of the chicken (the best part), as we all know that he doesn't like the white part. The soup was light yet full of flavor. I recommend eating all of his ramen with kimchi if you are Korean, or if you just enjoy kimchi. He has put the kimchi in a clever jar, if you don't finish it you can take the jar home! I believe the reason why his restraint has such low reviews os because of the price, but for what he is offering such as presentation, environment, service, and food it is a very fair price. Also his ramen is not supposed to be the typical traditional super authentic ramen. If you have seen his show The Mind Of A Chef, then you would know otherwise. P.S. I was amazed by the cream ice cream, my tastebuds were shocked. It tastes exactly like the savory part of a bowl of cereal. That bowl of cereal flavored milk we all love that sits there for us at the end of our Honey nut cheerio or corn flake eating.

The wait staff was fantastic, as well.[THE FOOD]The lunch menu is really simple, in a good way. You should be coming here for the chicken, anyway. If we were hungrier, we'd have opted for the $38 'Lucky Dice' special for two, which has the jackpot chicken, wings, hamburg, and soup/salad.We each got:1) THE JACKPOT CHICKEN (with crispy skin) - $15 for the lunch special, which includes jackpot chicken, rice, ginger-scallion sauce, and winter melon soup. Loved it! Reminded me of my childhood (with the soft chicken skin as well). The ginger scallion sauce was pungent and tasty. The crispy skin is a must get, and almost chip like. Also the rice was killer (had a hint of chicken fat in it. Yea.)2) ROAST CHICKEN RICE (with crispy skin) - Tastes like a mix between chicken and char siu. I liked the pickled green papaya that came with it. I'd go classic with the jackpot chicken, though. Next time I'd add a soy sauce egg, too! I know it's sometimes hard to justify getting Hainanese chicken for $15, but you get a hip restaurant and nice service with it. Would definitely come back.

So I was absolutely thrilled when my friend chose this restaurant for her birthday dinner! The restaurant was quite small, so we arrived promptly at 6 to avoid waiting for a seat. Now onto the food!One friend was very squeamish about all the nose-to-tail options available at the restaurant, so she asked for a recommendation for the safest option on the menu, which turned out to be potato & roe ($12). It was actually quite an ordinary potato soup, save for the addition of large salmon roes. I didn't actually think that the salmon roes added that much to the soup, but on the whole, it was tasty.The rest of us were more adventurous and ordered a bunch of dishes to share. The Black Hoof is most well-known for their charcuterie, so naturally, we had to order a platter of house cured meats ($29) to share. I honestly couldn't remember all the names of the meat, but I know that there was duck prosciutto and walnut studded salami. We also had a large order of bread ($4) to go with the charcuterie. I thought that the charcuterie was good, but everything tasted pretty similar and nothing really stood out.I've never tried horse meat before, so I was pretty excited for The Black Hoof's spicy horse tartare ($16). To my delight, it was quite delicious! To be perfectly honest, the horse meat just tasted like beef, but the texture was a good contrast against the crispy fried potato sticks. Everything together was quite rich (especially with that creamy sauce), so I recommend sharing this with a larger group.I also quite enjoyed smoked sweetbreads ($16). Eating an animal's thymus gland might sound disgusting, but it certainly tasted great! They reminded me of delicious and juicy chicken nuggets!I was extremely eager for tongue on brioche ($14) because I absolutely loved The Hoof Cafe's tongue grilled cheese. Sadly, this was not as good as the sandwich in my memory. We also wanted to try bone marrow here, but our server missed our order. No matter, as we were already sufficiently satisfied and everything was exceedingly rich.  All in all, I enjoyed the food at The Black Hoof, but it didn't exactly live up to my expectations (which were set by The Hoof Cafe). ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2221, 2235)",1,0.0,False

This is how our evening played out. Took the scenic elevator up and was able to enjoy the beautiful city lights. Arrived close to 6pm on a Sunday and noticed it was quite empty, but for some reason they had difficulty finding us a table for 4... We were politely told to wait while the 2 hostesses scrambled for 10 minutes to come up with the ingenious plan of placing 2 round tables together to form a table of 4. The restaurant appeared to be overstaffed with many workers wandering aimlessly back and forth making eye contact with their hands because God forbid they actually look at the patrons to see if they have been attended to. We waited 15 minutes before we got our bread, another 10 minutes before someone noticed we didn't get our water yet and finally after 30 minutes of being seated our waitress acknowledge our existence. She apologized several times as she was not informed that she was suppose to wait tables on our side of the restaurant. Nothing against our waitress, she was pleasant and tried her best to serve in this disorganized and poorly managed restaurant.Our highlight of the night was the bread. The bread was warm, soft and kept our stomachs from devouring itself as we wait to place our orders. Everything went downhill after that warm fluffy bread. The food was mediocre at best. My entree, the lamb pasta, came with an extra ingredient... a strand of curly hair... Chef special i guess... Not only was the pasta not very tasty, that piece of hair just put me off for the rest of the evening. Our waitress was busy serving other tables so I had to tell the waitstaff that cleared our table what I had found in my dish. His response was just an oh... no apology no nothing. I proceeded to tell him to take it back as I'm too put off to eat another bite. About 15 minutes passed before our waitress learnt about the hair in the food and came by to apologize and advised us the manager will be with us shortly.It wasn't until another 15 minutes until the manager confusingly found his way to our table. Contrary to what appeared to be an overstaffed restaurant, the manager informed us 2 employees had called in sick, which resulted in the backlog and him serving tables as well. He reassured us that the kitchen staff all wear hair nets and etc, he apologized and offered me another dish which I declined. He then proceed to take my meal off the tab and give us a 15% off the entire bill which I believe was fair. It's just getting the bill took another 20 minutes which is beyond ridiculous.Customer service is definitely not a priority in this restaurant. We've been to CN Tower 360 (loved it!) which prior to our experience at Toula, would perceive them to be on a similar level of restaurants but boy were we fooled. Granted it wasn't a winterlicious special at 360 but isn't the purpose of winterlicious to entice potential patrons for another future visit? Not scare them off with mediocre food and extremely slow service?All in all, this horrible dining experience could have been immensely improved had the staff been properly trained to provide better customer service.

On one hand, I think the recent proliferation of mega bars (Real Sports, etc.) within walking distance of the Rogers Centre, the ACC, the financial district and the waterfront is a positive for the city, both in terms of tourism and serving the exploding condo neighbourhoods. On the other hand, these massive restaurants often fail in their execution.The BrewHouse certainly gets some things right. The outdoor seating is great, even if most of the tables don't really have any water views to speak of. It's a great summer vibe out there nonetheless. Also, the service was better than I would expect for such a big place.As you might expect, the beer is the real star here. In addition to the mass produced Amsterdam beers that have been available for some time, there are many craft and seasonal beers. It was my first visit, and it was for dinner before a Jays game, so I didn't order anything too adventurous. The Boneshaker is quite good if you're looking for something hoppy. For something lighter and fruitier, the Market Pale Ale is nice.  In terms of food, I had the smoke house burger, which was decent, but the kettle chips that came with it were soggy and almost inedible. We later saw that they had a huge line of kettle chips ready to go out with each order. This type of production-line food preparation, while possibly necessary to serve 500-800ish people, really diminishes quality. In terms of cost, the food isn't outrageously expensive given the location, but don't expect anything amazing.Many have complained about epic lines and wait times, but I'd imagine this will be less of an issue over time. We went on a Friday just before 5PM and got a table for four outside without any wait. We left around 7PM and there were still plenty of inside tables left. I would imagine in the winter months that they plan on attracting more of the local condo residents and those going to events at the ACC to fill the inside, since it's a big space to fill.

Food: The buffet has many options and is organized into sections: grilled foods, sushi, dessert bar, bread & soup, etc. The dragon oden station, which is by the salad and dessert bar, caught my eye. At this station, you get to customize your own noodle soup with vegetables, fried tofu, fish balls, and udon noodles. Then, they cook it in a pot for you and you choose the broth that you want. I chose the Szechuan beef broth, which was quite spicy but flavourful! The taste reminded me of the spicy broth that is usually used for hot pot. Other memorable foods that I liked were the red sausage, curry fish balls, and grilled squid. I also tried the fried scallop & tofu. To my surprise, it was actually fried tofu shaped like a scallop.For dessert, I had the green tea mousse cake, nanaimo bar, and the almond cookies. These were a bit too sweet but it was decent overall. I also tried the cappuccino ice cream that was labelled sugar-free. Unfortunately, it was too sweet for me. Value: At regular pricing, I would probably go for dim sum if I want some variety.

You can order the noodles thick or thin - both are cooked right (not al dente, but not mushy) , so it is really a matter of your personal tastes.The zangi fried chicken is perfect to share. It is always fried to perfection served with a few slices of lemon. Not too oily, not too dry!Lastly for the calpico, it is cheaper than T&T stores.

If you've been to East Asia and was lucky enough to dine on the geographically exclusive durian and tofu flavoured ice cream/gelato, then you have to wiggle your behind over to Kekou!  Kekou manages to banish all elements of geographical boundaries, serving notable flavours, such as durian, almond tofu, Vietnamese coffee, jasmine tea, whiskey green tea, rosewater pistachio, and the list goes on.Many of these dairy goodies are made in-house and none of them have preservatives, stabilizers, food colouring, dextrose, corn syrup, soy lecithin, and etc.  I give this a big thumbs up, because you see too many products out there labeled as frozen dairy desserts rather than desserts made with real milk and cream without all the unpronounceable chemicals and additives. My usual go-to is the durian gelato, which comes to no surprise (re: my name).  This time around, however, I opted for the Rosewater Pistachio gelato and the Almond Tofu gelato, partly because I have been on the rosewater beauty bandwagon for some time now and partly because tofu has always been a great ingredient in East-Asian desserts for as long as I can remember.  Both gelatos had great flavour.  They didn't taste water-downed or too in-your-face.  They tasted very refreshing, actually, so much so that you wouldn't think you were eating anything unhealthy at all!Kekou's staff members are very friendly and are eager to let you sample any of their concoctions during your visit.  Need a cup of joe every morning? Then grab the Vietnamese Coffee.  Love your original bubble tea?  Try the HK Milk Tea or Jasmine Tea.  Need a bit of adult zing in your dessert? Then I highly recommend the Whiskey Green Tea (another personal favourite).  From what I've seen, they rotate their flavours, so sometimes you'll be lucky enough to find the soy bean/kinako gelatos and some other ginger varieties (right now, they have Chocolate Ginger, but I'm not a chocolate fan).  Kekou has been my HG dessert joint since its inception and I think it will remain in this place, even in the face of iHalo Krunch (which has charcoal and ube ice cream), Pablo (Japanese cheese tart master), and the ever-expanding Japanese cheesecake fad.

Indulged here for dinner during Winterlicious 2014! I've never been here before that so I'm not sure how they are on a regular basis with a regular menu. Needless to say, it is on the pricier end. To start off, the ambience and atmosphere is lovely! Really nice for a special occasion - the view more than makes up for the corporate feel of the TD Tower. When we arrived (party of 4 - two couples), our table wasn't ready. They took our coats and suggested we wait in the bar area. That was fine. We grabbed a table and enjoyed the view while sipping on our drinks. They had 4 beers on hand and we ordered one of each. Nothing memorable, the usual Steamwhistle etc. We were then taken to our table about 15 minutes later. We were served an amuse bouche of bread and condiments - tasty but unmemorable. Here is what we ordered: - Butternut Squash Soup - Cured Rainbow Trout- Pork Terrine - Roasted Chicken  - Braised Beef Ribs/Steak - Carrot Cake - Three Milk Cake  (I think) The soup was alright - it tasted something like my mom makes at home; good, but nothing spectacular. The trout was sashimi style. I found the portion rather small, but it was tasty. Again, it didn't stand out for me. My SO was the only one who ordered the pork terrine, and I found it absolutely phenomenal! He said it tasted like fish or SPAM, but I personally loved both the texture and flavour and the accompanying fruity condiments. The roasted chicken was fabulous! I adored every bite - 2 of us got this dish and we both loved it. The chicken was so soft and tender, the sauces were flavourful and complimented the dish well, and the vegetables and I believe wild rice or risotto, were a nice touch. It was perfect! Again, the portion was on the smaller end, but alongside the appetizer, I was getting full by this point. My SO and the other diner got the beef dish. It came with a braised short rib and mashed potatoes. Wow. This dish was out of this world! We all loved the beef and it was done to a perfect medium/medium-rare. The carrot cake was perfect and my only complaint was that I wished the portion was bigger. The cream cheese 'icing'  they served alongside it was absolutely heavenly. My SO got the three milk cake, I believe. I wasn't a huge fan. It wasn't terrible, but it did not stand out to me. Service was flawless - our water glasses were kept full, the servers were gracious and unpretentious. One of them even noticed us trying to take pictures and offered to take one of the group for us! They were friendly and very precise - they cleared our tables with manners and skill. No complaints with them. Presentation was top notch. Everything came looking extremely pretty. Our only complaint was that we wished the portions were a little bigger. The two males in our group noted that they could go for another round of the entrees. I was moderately full - if my dessert had been even 1/2 a size bigger, I would have reached that mark. My other friend, who is a very light eater, was completely satisfied. All in all, I loved my experience at Canoe. I think I would definitely go back to try their regular menu, however, it is quite pricey, so perhaps for a special occasion. The entrees were quite truly amazing, and the desserts satisfying. The appetizers have potential, but could use some work. Maybe we are big eaters or it was simply Winterlicious, but I believe the portions could have been slightly larger. Definitely recommend this place though!

Each time I visit the restaurant, I order the same thing and leave satisfied. Their noodles are left al dente and nothing is overcooked. From their eggs to the pork in the soup, each item is seasoned well and still fresh. Their fried chicken is also delicious, with a very light batter which leaves the chicken light and airy. They serve it with a lemon slice which adds the hint of freshness to the dish. The staff are very friendly and the service is quick. They restaurant is very narrow and fills up quickly so I would recommend dining at off hours such as 11:30am or you will need to wait in line. Having tried other ramen restaurants, I find that their broth has depth of flavor that other restaurants do not. Whether you are craving soup on a cold day or just looking for some great noodles, this restaurant is a must try in Toronto! ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1223, 1237)",1,0.0,False

I've eaten at many places for Thai food, from Khao San Road, Thai House Cusine, Golden Thai Restaurant, Spice Thai Cafe, you get the picture. The flavor and moisture of the chicken was phenomenal. It came with a hott sauce and a vinaigrette, absolutely delicious. I highly recommend trying this appetizer.For our mains, we ate the Khao Soi & Chef Nuit's Pad Thai. The Khao Soi was delicious to the last spoonful. A variety of flavors run through your mouth in every bite. Spices were perfect, noodles were fresh and the soup was mouth watering. Chef Nuit's Pad Thai was an instant classic, watch for your heat request, they can get real spicy real fast, I requested for the spice to be on the side. Again, fresh flavors, tender meat, absolutely delicious.Price:Our bill came up to almost $75 before tip. We also drank Singha Beers & has a couple of Sake Bombs! So much fun.Overall, just writing this review and thinking about their food makes me crave them even more. Take a look at some of the photos I posted, but I suggest go have a bite in your free time to really appreciate the taste. This will be my new go to Thai Food place when the cravings hit.

The atmosphere in this place is amazing! Starting from the decor, to the service, to the amazing bar setup, and the DJ spinning great music. Also - the patio is a great chill out spot. Our group came here for a birthday and we enjoyed ourselves overall. Didn't have any problems with service, and loved our drinks. I got the Mango Margarita and a minty Mojito I forgot the name of, and both were very tasty and also really strong. Although the prices were a little steeper than average, I felt like I got my bang for buck because the liquor content was really worth it. Beers were around $9/pint and shots (Tequila) starting at around $6. Not incredibly overpriced (given the area - Distillery District), but there are definitely cheaper places out there. The only downside we faced was with the food. My boyfriend (the birthday boy) and I shared the mahi mahi ceviche, raw beef tostada, and Baja fish tacos. My favourite would have to be the Baja fish tacos, but at $15 for 3 really small tacos, you could easily go to Kensington for a better meal for both your stomach and wallet. The ceviche was also really fresh and good. No complaints about the tostada but it wasn't memorable either. So while the food didn't disappoint us, it also wasn't good or big enough to justify the price. Note: Two of our friends ordered a pork dish and complained it was mostly fat. However, when they complained that there was a chip on of their beer mugs, the manager came over straight away and replaced the beer with a free full pint. Impression: good service, not so great food. All in all, spending over $80 for two mixed drinks (albeit large and strong ones), a shot of tequila, and three small dishes and a shared guacamole (granted, they made it fresh table side - nice touch) for the table (of 6 people), just didn't seem worth it for me. Even with the fantastic ambience and atmosphere! Verdict: I don't regret coming here, it's definitely worth checking out and our experience was more or less good. We had a fun time! But just keep in mind that the bill really easily racks up here. Trying the food just really is a one time thing here. Would recommend and return - but for drinks/atmosphere only.

Both have their own version of the Big Mac sandwich. Both have order counters and then seating areas for the hardcore. And both grind their beef fresh daily. But I'd give kudos to Burger's Priest for a few reasons: While imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, they were the original. Secondly, they're the better of the two.

If it was up to me, I'd be dining here daily but for the time being, it will remain a special occasion establishment. Hopefully not for long! Ruby Watcho is an easygoing restaurant that packs a serious punch. We made 7:30 reservations the night before and it was no problem. Immediately when we came in, we were greeted by an owner, Joey. He was wonderful to talk to, so funny as we got settled in. We ordered a bottle of wine and were asked about any allergies. My roommate disclosed again that she was vegetarian. No meat? No fish? No problem! These guys are not going to turn you away; they're here to help. From start to finish, it was exceptional. Expectations are thrown out the window when a huge plate of salad appears. Reading the menu I was not sure what to anticipate: marinated red and yellow peppers, red watercress, romaine hearts, pecorino, fried capers, candied olives, spiced almonds and a basil vinaigrette. With so many things were happening on one plate, I wasn't sure how it would turn out. This just proves to be another reason why I am not a chef. Lynn has the vision! The salad was fresh and vibrant with that basil dressing. The peppers were a soft and slippery bite. The lettuces were unlike any I've seen before, seemingly straight from the garden, just missing roots. Then the olives, capers and almonds added a salty, spicy, sweet element that made each bite completely different while adding that crunch. As for pecorino cheese, well, you really can't go wrong with the generous shavings. The pace of the meal is nice and steady. They let you take your time and give you the right breaks to digest. So after that heap of salad, we were ready to see what was next. The main meat was a slow roasted leg of lamb with walnut and mint pesto. It was perfectly cooked and juicy, with two streaks of it all for me! The pesto was a great addition, for the minty freshness that complimented it so. Sides were equally up to snuff. Lemon scented fingerling potatoes with thyme were perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, sliced down the middle. Also there was sauteed rapini with a cherry tomato vinaigrette that was mustard-y and delectable, alongside a refreshing cucumber and red onion salad in a goat yogurt dressing. Lynn knows her salads! Next was the cheese course, which oddly enough was what we were most excited for. I mean, I love cheese. It's not every day that someone caters so specifically to my adoring respect for cheese. And yet, here it was: a wedge of comfort cream with an apple herd salad drizzled with truffled honey. As the waiter set it down and described the dish, he shrilled, WHAT DID YOU CALL ME?! and it was hilarious. The whole restaurant and staff can be my truffled honeys. Apple and herbs (dill?) is a pairing that I don't see every day and it was SO good with the cheese. Getting everything on the grilled bread alongside was key and perfect. You would think we'd be bursting at this point but we actually managed to keep it together by only taking one serving for each of the main dishes. Finally, dessert time included a espesso cheesecake with Bailey's caramel sauce. Yes, it was tasted exactly as it sounds AKA amazing. It was a very rich dessert which I could only handle a few bites of but it was wonderful end to the meal that we gladly took home to enjoy later. At this point, we felt like we are best friends with Joey and he tells us we should go visit Lynn Crawford who is actually on site, in her chef gear, helping out here and there in the kitchen. We went over and she could not be any nicer, talking to us for several minutes, asking up about our experience, even school and summer plans. We took a picture with LC because we're cool like that and then left on the biggest high. Counting down the days until I return! ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3904, 3918)",1,0.0,False

You enter and I only expected it to be a small place (think old Khao San Road) but then we got seated at the inner back area where it was a lot more bright and the music a lot louder. I was pleasantly surprised we didn't have to wait for an early dinner on a Saturday but could see the lines forming as we left.

I appreciate that this place tries to offer more rustic options. Prices are definitely on the steeper side but there's a certain refinement in the food here.I had the privilege of trying a variety of dishes here. I'll start with the good. Chef Nuit's pad Thai is by far the best pad Thai I've had in the city. The balance is delectable; and the rice noodles were perfectly cooked with just the right amount of elasticity and chew. We went with the veggie pad Thai and it was loaded with tofu and veggies. It also had a nice stir fry taste (wok seared taste I call it) which added that smokiness. The Khao soi here was around average. I've definitely had better in the city. I felt it could have been more rich but appreciated the fact they gave the pickled mustard green on the side adding to the authenticity. The braised beef was somewhat dry but the fattier parts provided better balance.I also tried the miang kung which was a betel leaf wrap. There was a nice mintiness to the leaf and a whole bunch of flavors going on with the coconut, the chilies, the garlic, and the sauces. It would be great to share but not to order as a main. I also tried the Kao pad thamada which was essentially like fried rice. The rice was really fragrant but was rather ordinary. Don't forget to order the Thai ice tea here, although pricey, it's a nice compliment to the meal especially if you can't handle the heat and soothes down your taste buds.

Great portions, four large ribs with plenty of tender meat along with a couple peices of ends thrown in. Really well smoked, not too sweet but delicious even without the sauces. The chicken fried dinner was good also. The skin is lightly battered but crispy while the meat stayed moist and flavorful.

I would say most of them are having very good presentation, yet not much attention has been put on the food itself. The sesame asparagus frit per se is such an awesome idea, deep fried sesame is already a promise for the rich flavor and fragrance. With the crispy asparagus, I would imagine it will be such an amazing dish! However, the end result was the sesame was burned because of deep frying too long,  asparagus was soggy, and the frit was very greasy, usually a result of lukewarm oil. This is a very disappointing dish with great concept, which I will definitely try it out at home. The other appetizer like scallop, pontine, tar tar, nochalos, are all on the same line. They are great idea, but poor execution. The main dish was slightly better, even though my friend didn't like it at all. It was a lamb stew in tomato sauce, the lamb was tendered enough, and flavorful. Sauce was rich, typical for French cuisine.

I also wish the menu included some of the items in the pictures that other reviewers had because the night we went, there wasn't anything overly mind-blowing to choose from, though everything we had was good--just not spectacular which was what I expected as Buca has always been highly recommended.  We originally planned to go to Terroni as I was craving one of their pizzas which kind of comes close to the pizza of all pizzas I had in Milan, but their lineup was too long and I was DAMN hungry so we headed for Buca where we were able to snatch up a table right away. If you've never been, it's on King--next door to Cheval--they're separated by a laneway that leads to Buca's doors. Go through the doors and down the stairs to discover a beautiful space with exposed brick walls (I know, cliche~), and two dining rooms (one is more a wine cellar), dim lighting...romantic if you want it to be. We ordered:- the nodini were OK; they're adorable little nubs of bread doused in oil & garlic, but I probably won't bother ordering them next time- lamb skewers - I let my friend go to town on those and he was practically squealing with delight between bites whereas I am not a lamb fan, though I wish I were!- breaded, fried eggplant layered with fresh basil leaves, parm & ricotta and a squirt of burrata on top - judging from the description, I was kind of expecting something similar to eggplant parmaggiano (minus the tomato sauce) which is one of my favourite dishes but instead it was very bland; not a single ingredient besides the basil offered any flavour  - salsiccia pizza - very good pizza, served on a long cutting board and as everyone else mentioned: scissors for your convenience, which I've only ever seen in Korean restaurants...I was torn between the veal tenderloin and the sea bass, when my eye caught their list of pizzas and their scamorza seemed to be a close fit to the pizza I would have had at Terroni so I went with that. While I enjoyed every bite of it, instead of us ordering two pizzas, I should have had one of the other mains so as to get a real taste of chef Gentile's range of talent (I'm sure he's wonderful). You know what this means...I'll have to go back.- Buca's got this crazy-extensive tome of wines so if you're a wine-lover, I am sure you'll be pleased.  - (Wait, I'm not done!) We shared the dessert of 3 big balls of gelato of your choosing. Ours included lavender (my friend nearly threw up when he tasted it; I guess it's not for everyone), hazelnut (TONS of nuts throughout, like I've never seen--which I loved), and blood orange (SO GOOD), all sprinkled with toasted spices. I am guessing they make their own gelato, which was clearly the most popular dessert.Along with your bill, you get the cutest little packet containing a tiny nougat-ball with their card attached. I love it when restaurants go the extra mile with such small details! Service was excellent--I always get a kick out of places that insist on reciting your order back to you as each dish is presented at your table, though I'm not sure all the waiters were Italian as many suggest. Whatever the case, I found most of their service to have a real old-school polished-ness about it which is not terribly common, so that was nice. Considering this was an unplanned, passing-by situation on a Sunday night, the meal was a bit of a splurge, though not totally insane. Buca is definitely on the pricey side but prime location, excellent service, and chef Gentile all come at a price, though I will definitely go back to Buca as I am curious to try their other dishes which I am sure are amazing. To say I LOVE them is a bit of a stretch (for now) but their food is fresh and service professional, which is enough to warrant another go.

It was also another favourite at the table - again that tahini sauce was amazing and went so well with the charred flavour of the cauliflower. Crispy Confit Duck - yes so our table seemed to have a tad predisposition to duck - but to be fair the true star was the rice .   There was a myriad of flavours and textures from just one bite: crispy (from the duck shreds); crunchy (almonds); sweet from the molasses and cinnamon.  and if you are looking to spend less at this restaurant without sacrificing quality and flavour, this would be the one to order!

Intricate designs on the walls, carefully planned lighting, tasteful and trendy furniture and decor - I really enjoyed the setting.First, the parking situation. We found parking for $6.00 on a Friday evening in a parking garage at King Street and Spadina Avenue, just east of the restaurant. Second, the service. Super friendly, pleasant, and honest. Our waiter even stopped us from ordering more food, letting us know when we ordered too much (his recommendations were on point - we ordered just enough).Third, while the environment and the service were excellent, the food was just alright. We ordered: a) jamon serrano, b) meatballs, c) bacon covered dates, d) empanadas, e) chicken paella, and f) a glass of red sangria, To be honest, I couldn't hold down the bacon wrapped dates (I don't enjoy dates to begin with, so this was definitely not for me). The jammon serrano (aged for 24 months) was just fine, but nothing out of the ordinary. Same for the empanadas and meatballs - while it tasted fine enough, we've definitely had better elsewhere. The chicken paella was the best item out of everything we had, full of flavour and texture. Definitely try this if you're here for dinner.Overall, we'd come back here for a group dinner or to start off a fun evening, but we wouldn't come back for the food or if tasty food was our priority. On the whole, Patria isn't bad, but it's not the best. Also, we weren't too hungry to begin with, so we were fine with portion size, but if you are coming super hungry, note that there's a good chance you'll find portion size a bit small.

At 50$ I expect a spectacular cut of meat and veg I am presented with 3 small  uneven chunks of Grissel filled fibrous meat, the jus is barely there and the vegetable on the plate.. is ...I don't know what it is, its over cooked bits from the bottom of the roasting pan..potato? parsnip? hard to tell.My partner gets a small piece of salmon nothing special not that tasty also with barely there vegetables i think there was a piece of parsley. All I can say is thank god there was bread on the table and a very nice bean based spread, because this meal was NOT satisfying. 2 glasses of wine and a Caeser and over $240.00.Really Canoe?

It's a very refreshing dish with a naturally sweet scent that goes perfectly with the soy sauce and a bit of wasabi. Ordered this every time, it has only tasted less than perfection once (slightly slimy once). The chorizo octopus appetizer.. Oh my god I wish literally any other restaurant could make this and have it cheaper because then I would go to said restaurant all the time. The most tender octopus I've had in my life with a unique sauce on the side paired with some diced chorizo sausages. Only ordered this twice, relatively new discovery for me here, not sure how consistently they make this dish. When it's on point, you'll know, because it will taste SO MUCH BETTER than any octopus you've had anywhere else cooked in any way.The dessert is probably the best dessert I've had in my life. You can't go wrong with either the lava cake (even though they refuse to call it that, it is what it is) nor the mochi. Just try it, I have huge dessert enthusiast friends that would agree.One thing to note: it costs me roughly 100 dollars every time I come here to get filled up (I do eat a bit more than the average person). Is it worth it? 100 times yes. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1799, 1813)",5,0.0,False

Each and every time I have gone I've been very impressed with the décor, ambience, and quality of food while service remained at par. After browsing many reviews online, it became quite evident that this is a chain that does not pride itself on service, especially the Queen St. location which has one of the worst service reps I have ever encountered.  Having said that, let's talk food. The majority of the antipastos are delicious. I always order the carpaccio di manzo, a dish I typically order when I eat out I-tal. The Frittura di Calamari is great as well, a lightly battered deep fried calamari complimented well with lemon.  If you are with a group I highly recommend ordering the Tagliere Mezzo e Mezzo, a selection of Italian/local meats and cheeses. On a few occasions I recall having prosciutto di parma, smoked prosciutto, hot calabrese salami, fontina, smoked scamorza, pecarino, and parm + more, I do believe these are constantly changing day to day. I have not tried a pasta dish at Terroni's that I didn't enjoy. They also carry traditional types of pasta which you don't find everywhere like: Orecchiette, papardelle, garganelli and tagliatelle.  Most of the pastas such as the delicious gnocci are handmade in house, I personally heart the Mezze Maniche al Ragu d'Anatra, a duck ragu with spinach, mascarpone and parm.  As for the pizza, it is truly a-ma-zing, they really do rival Pizzeria Libretto. Terroni's has at least 20 pizzas and really you can't go wrong, even with the basic Margherita or Marinara. This may be attributed to the fact that Terroni's imports and packs they're own tomatos, in addition to making house specialties such as the homemade spicy sausage.  My favourite, like many others is the Smendozzata pizza: Tomato, mozza, homemade spicy sausage, gorgonzola, and red onions. This pizza is one of my favourite meals, period. It must have to do with the combination of flavour such as the mozza and gorgonzola melting and fusing with the house sausage and caramelizing onions, omg.   Other notable pizzas are the Natalina: Tomato, mozza, roasted red peppers, hot calabrese salami, garlic and olives. C't Mang: White pizza w/ mozza, gorgonzola, fresh pears, speck (smoked prosciutto), walnuts and honey. Quattro Stagiono: Tomato, mozza,  prosciutto di Parma,  eggplant,  zucchini and olives. If you have space for desert, let it be known Terroni's boasts the most popular desert item I have ever come across in my life. I know some girls, including my g/f, who would give up everything for just one bite. The item is a flourless dark chocolate lava cake which is so good that Terroni's could probably stay open just selling that desert. All in all if you're looking for a stand out Italian dinner full of delicious apps, pastas, pizza and a to-die-for desert Terroni's is your spot.

It is very rare that I complain to a manager or send food back. But this happened last night.We ordered the chicken and leek potstickers and the black tiger shrimp appetizers. The potstickers were bland. They are missing something. The shrimp was ok but it was just deep fried and salty so how can that be bad? We then ordered mac n cheese and the steak (striploin, I believe). I asked for medium well and it came out so unbelievably tough that you could hardly chew it. And it took a lot of sawing to cut through it. It was inedible. I have never had a steak cooked as tough as that. It was like eating an old shoe. The collards that came with it tasted alright (I had one bite) and I didn't get to try the polenta.... because to our horror, there was a giant HAIR IN THE MAC N CHEESE. And it wasn't mine or my friend's. It was baked into the dish. I didn't get to try the mac n cheese because of hairgate either but my friend did and she said it was bland. We were intending to share our entrees but after that, we just called our waiter and had it all sent back. He offered us new entrees but at this point, we had been there for almost 90 minutes. We have children. We were tired. We didn't want to wait another hour for food. So, we got dessert and coffee. We're thinking the dessert will be great. WRONG. The gelato was freezer burned. Badly. It was the first thing my friend noticed when she took a bite of her carrot cake (comes with gelato) and made a face. My gelato was as well, both of the flavors (lemon and vanilla). My chocolate marquise cake was not that great either. You can get better desserts at any local bakery. To top it off, the coffees were bitter.We ended up complaining and the manager took off the entrees off the bill but that was it. I really feel like he should have offered a few drinks for free or something considering EVERY SINGLE THING we ordered was total crap. Our bill was STILL $115. Unacceptable. It was so bad that I honestly don't think I will ever eat here again. I don't even want to give it another chance. The standard has become so poor, so low, that I don't want to waste my money here and I'd be embarrassed to take someone here with that quality of food at what should, by the looks of the place, be a good eatery.

AnalysisPork Jowl - The meat melted in your mouth and was soft (supposed to be simmered).  It was delicious.Ramen - flavour and looks akin to egg noodles but with a thicker cut. Don't let it throw you off though it has more elasticity to it and makes it quire springy.Shio broth - Very rich, they use a similar method of Crossing-the-bridge noodles. They have thin layer of lard on top which reflects the heat back into the soup.  Don't let the lack of steam coming from the top trick you that the soup isn't hot.  The lard will also coat the food making it very smooth.  Things I can kind of identify inside the broth. sesame, miso (something akin to it), green onion, bamboo shoots (menma). fungi (cloud ear) and salt. I drank every last drop of the soup.Additional Information:Environment: simply minimalistic design.

Food: The buffet has many options and is organized into sections: grilled foods, sushi, dessert bar, bread & soup, etc. The dragon oden station, which is by the salad and dessert bar, caught my eye. At this station, you get to customize your own noodle soup with vegetables, fried tofu, fish balls, and udon noodles. Then, they cook it in a pot for you and you choose the broth that you want. I chose the Szechuan beef broth, which was quite spicy but flavourful! The taste reminded me of the spicy broth that is usually used for hot pot.

Everything is reasonably priced and the portions are decent. There are very limited seats, but turnover is usually high as it takes no time to scarf down a couple tacos or a banh mi.My favourites so far are the five spice pork belly bao, the squid taco, and the kimchi fries. The soft baos are the perfect vessels as they soak up all those delicious juices. The five spiced pork belly is full of flavour and tender too. A squid taco sounded scary and not very appetizing at first, but I'm glad I conquered that fear because it's seriously delicious. The crunchy breading, the sweet squid, the tangy mayo along with the pickled veggies and cilantro work so well together. Lastly the kimchi fries were so generously portioned, and only $5.99, I would have been satisfied just eating them all on their own. Again there's a great blend of flavours (spicy, salty, sweet, tangy) and textures (crunchy, creamy) that make this a winning option.Definitely stop by if you haven't already, but be prepared to do some waiting as the kitchen gets backed up during peak times.

Definitely a place I would come back to in order to try their other dishes. We came here for Easter Sunday brunch had a great time!Wait time: Knowing full well the notorious wait time for brunch here we were mentally prepared to stand outside and brave the April rain/snow (welcome to Toronto). We saw a small line up out the door but went in to try our luck anyways. A very friendly staff greeted us right at the entrance and told us that the wait time was going to just over an hour (We got there around 12:35pm). To our pleasant surprise he was able to take our name and phone number so we can hang out somewhere else and get a text when our table was ready (every restaurant should do this!) so we can come back. He was very nice, and I did not feel rushed at all, another pleasant surprise given the restaurant's popularity. We hung out around liberty village market just a block away and got a text 50 minutes later.Parking: There is a huge green P parking lot that has the new mobile pay function right across the street from the restaurant, super convenient and hard to come by if this was right in downtown. Parking is $3 for an hour.FOOD: Everything other reviewers have said. I really liked the fact that the menu was small so making a choice is (relatively) easy. I got the special pink lemonade, smoked salmon breakfast salad, my boyfriend got cheesy french toast, and hash brown with jalapeno and sour cream to share. My salad was very fresh, crunchy, and refreshing, with just the perfect amount of dressing. The fingerling potato I thought was a bit on the bland side when eaten alone, but if you eat it with the smoked salmon it would be perfect. There is a perfectly cooked sunny side up egg on top of the salad and though it may seem like a strange combination, it all works really well. The salad is actually bigger than I expected as I walked out absolutely stuffed. I had a bite of the cheesy toast and yup, every bit as delicous as other reviewers have said. The bacon is cooked just right, not too crunchy, and a little bit sweet fromt he maple syrup that was served alongside the dish. You can still taste the smokey pork flavour which I think should be the new golden standard for bacon :)Service: Very friendly, very geniune, not pretentious or snobby AT ALL. The staff made me feel very comfortable, not rushed at all (even though people were constantly lining up all the way to the entrance). They checked up on us just the right amount without being intrusive or pushy and I saw that they all gave the same amount of care to every other customer which I think is amazing.Price: average $30 a person if you are getting a drink with your order, I thought it was very fair given the experience. Not exactly a bargain but I definitely didn't feel like I was ripped off, especially given the fact that parking was convenient, inexpensive, and the wait time wasn't terrible.Would I come back again? 100%.

But given that we had theater tickets one Friday night, the time was finally right to sample Byblos' much-ballyhooed wares.We arrived at around 6:15 and we promptly shown to our reserved table near the front. Our very helpful waitress appeared shortly after and we began the slow process of figuring out just what to eat. We ultimately chose six items:Duck Kibbeh (dried fig + date molasses + tahini): This was easily the highlight of the entire meal. I've eaten plenty of kibbeh over my lifetime but this is unquestionably the tastiest version of this venerable dish I've ever had. Everything was perfect, from the delectable spices to the unctuous, melt-in-your-mouth meat to the note-perfect sauce. Just astounding.Spanish Octopus (fingerling potato + biber chili vinaigrette + preserved lemon): Although the octopus was cooked about as well as I've ever had it - the octopus at Bar Isabel, for example, was far chewier - there was nothing about this dish that really stood out. Perhaps it's because it came on the heels of the sublime Duck Kibbeh, but there was nothing here that really blew me away in terms of flavor - although the presentation was quite nice.Sujuk Pide (turkish paste + persian feta + za'atar): I'm a big fan of sujuk (a spicy Middle Eastern sausage), so I was especially excited about this one. It's very good. All the components work extremely well together and the enveloping crust is baked perfectly. I suppose my one complaint is the sujuk itself, which, in addition to not tasting like any sujuk I've ever had, is completely lacking in the heat I've come to associate with the sausage.Mejadra (lentil + hung yogurt + fried shallot): Again, this is something I've been eating my entire life and I have to say, unfortunately, that this dish just didn't measure up. Despite the aforementioned dollop of yogurt, the rice is just dry as heck. It's been cooked in a skillet, which allows the side and bottom rice to get crispy - an idea which sounds great in theory but doesn't really work here. Far more problematic is the fried shallot on top. Traditionally, the shallots (or onions) are taken beyond the point of caramelization, which lends the dish a rich flavor that's unfortunately completely absent here. This was definitely the biggest disappointment for me.Seared Cauliflower (duck fat + tahini sauce + sesame + coriander): This is a very tasty side that's almost workmanlike in its execution. It's well done but it's nothing special, sadly.Turkish Manti Dumplings (smokey eggplant + yogurt sauce + molasses): This incredibly rich dish admittedly goes well with the Mejadra, as it cuts that dryness I mentioned. But it might be just a little too rich; between the heavy yogurt sauce and the sweet molasses, it's impossible to taste the smokey eggplant supposedly contained within the dumplings.All in all, I quite enjoyed my meal at Byblos. The ambiance is inviting, the service is flawless, and the food is, for the most part, quite above average. And I'd sure as heck go back just to eat that Duck Kibbeh again.

Well, the kind of party that involves food, that is.Before we begin, let me educate you on the pronunciation of this place - read Verst. And its exact English translation is non other than sausage (figures). This recently opened spot in the heart of King West has been successfully luring in lunch crowds. With its sausage hall concept, breadth of sausage styles and flavours and an impressive local and imported beer menu; Wvrst has quickly become a favourite in the area and the Friday lunch go-to place for most of us.Their dedication to the core product, sausages; its one to admire. All sausages are freshly made on the premises and cooked when ordered. When you arrive at Wvrst, you right away notice a large line up of people (mostly men...I did say it was a sausage party) staring at the menu, asking the staff for advice and at times drinking beer while waiting in line. Because this is a sausage hall, once your food is ordered, you are given a number which then lets the waiters know which table to bring the food to. One thing you will notice is that because the line-ups are long, the waiters are extremely diligent in cleaning up the tables, so don't feel like they are rushing you, they are just doing their job and are very pleasant.Now, lets talk about the product. From the list, my favourite is the Venison style sausage. Given that its flavour is more on the smokey, nutty and hearty side, it makes it a great pairing with just about any topping. You can choose 2 out of 4 toppings - Caramelized Onions, Sauerkraut, Sweet Peppers and Sautéed Jalapeños. The roll used to wrap these juicy meats around is something worth mentioning, being on the rather soft side, this roll is lightly sweet with a hint of sourdough style bread, a great choice. Note to reader: you can also order a whole wheat roll and choice of veggie or chicken sausage options.Another one of Wvrst's hits is their Duck Fat Fries. Fried in duck fat as opposed to regular oil, the fries tend to be softer and buttery, while maintaining a great consistency on the surface. How this is done? A two step frying process. Double-dipping is what I would name this frying method. The outcome? Buttery and flavourful french fries. But the goodness does not end here, on top of having great tasting fries, Wvrst offers you a selection of dipping sauces. My favourite, and one that I can not live without, the Mojito sauce. Dip your fries in it or add it to your sausage party, either way you in are in for a heck of a tasty treat.Until next time Foodies!Buen Provecho,Viviana.

The decor is quite interesting and definitely unique, but I felt a bit cluttered and it was quite dark. They could probably use more fabric to break down the noise levels. With glass and tiling everywhere and he vast open space, I think it amplifies the noise level quite a bit. My boyfriend started off with a seafood chowder. I thought the broth base was quite nice and very flavourful. There's quite a variety of seafood in the dish so that was nice to enjoy. I had the swordfish ceviche. I am a sucker for seafood and i love acidity and freshness of ceviches. I was not disappointed with this dish at all. They did an amazing job with the swordfish slices and there's a crispy shrimp cracker to pair it with. I love that the sauce was very acidic and they had some fresh greens over top. There are dollops of guacamole that help break that acidity down and bring a new layer of flavour to each bite. I enjoyed it very much! The mains were not quite as impressive sadly to say. I had the chicken cordon bleu crepe topped with a poached egg which was paired with a very large side of slaw. I really liked the salad and again, the flavouring was on point. The chicken was sadly bland, but mixed with the slaw, crepe, yolk, ham and blue cheese, it was a nice meal. My boyfriend had sirloin which came with brussel sprouts and layered baked/roasted turnip. The vegetable sides were very well caramelized and flavourful. But the steak itself was rather plain and had no seasoning. It seams they do an all star job with the sides but really neglected the proteins. I guess we had different stars to our dishes that night. The desserts were interesting. I had the honey butter cake which tasted like a home made lemon cake I use to make. It was really quite delicious and I loved the cake texture. They put a yogurt gelato on top which brought in some tart flavour. And around the cake they had these lemon custard drops which were tart and I thought paired nicely with the sweet cake. My boyfriend had the tiramisu like cake or truffle chocolate bar. It was topped with some basil I believe, and it tasted quite nice. It was a bit sweet for my taste but that's milk chocolate for you. Service was nice. Our wait for the food was a bit lengthy but not to the point where it would be anything negative. I guess it's worth it because they do take the time to present the food nicely on the plate, and that can affect how it will taste as well. Our server was Alice and she was very attentive and friendly and she was there enough to check up on us but left us our space to enjoy our date night :)I would want to come back and try more of their main menu and brunch as well.

Even the Goddess of Alcohol which was described as the strongest drink on the menu had a good level of sugar going on.  The sangria was by far the most dry of the bunch, with a good hit of brandy in the mix.  Personally, however, I thought the best cocktails were the Cucumber Devil and the Mayan, which were refreshing and well-balanced with a nice kick of heat.  My least favourite of the bunch was Watermelon Fire because the watermelon was almost syrupy and artificial tasting. I also wouldn't want to finish an entire Aqua de Coco since I'm not a fan of creamy booze drinks at all. Having said that, there were so many tempting options on the menu, I'm sure with a little more sampling (g-d help me), I'd find even more boozy favourites.The food at El Catrin has been imagined and executed by Olivier LeCalvez, a French-trained, Cordon Bleu Mexico culinary instructor who was recruited straight from Mexico for the opening.  His approach seems to be to combine traditional preparations with local flavours and playful presentations.  In comparison to most of the new tapas style restaurants in the city, El Catrin touts a beast of a menu (emphasized by the literal size of the menu itself). Thankfully, to somewhat help with the navigation, the offerings are broken down into sections: Botanas, Cubetas (Shrimp), Burritos, Tostadas, Tortas, Ceviches, Tacos, Especialidades (Specials), Parillada (grilled items) and dessert. They also have special menus for children (Young Amigos), and patrons who want to eat gluten free.  After much deliberation, we decided to opt for:Guacamole En La Mesa: Avocado, Tomato, Red Onion, Cilantro, Serrano Chili ($9)Made table-side, I thought the guac was a solid first course.  Maybe a bit expensive for the quantity (we literally each got a few chips worth and then had to violently scrape the bowl), but a well seasoned, balanced guacamole. Ensalada de Esquites: Steamed Corn, Cilantro, El Catrin Aioli, Chili Piquin Powder, Quesillo Cheese ($8 for 3)This basically reminded me of a deconstructed street corn. It was much easier to eat than gnawing on a cob and getting white crèma on your face, but not quite as good. I definitely enjoyed it (because I can't imagine not enjoying fresh corn), but I did find it to be a bit too salty to want to eat much more than the shot glass-worth.Sopes: Corn Tortilla Stuffed with Black Bean Puree, Pulled Chicken, Salsa Verde, Lettuce and Queso Fresco ($12 for 2)I wasn't going to even order this but I was so glad our server talked me into it as it turned out to be my favourite dish of the night. The sopes had this cushion-like texture and a mild sweet flavour, that when combined with the moist chicken, earthy beans, fresh salsa, and salty cheese, was perfectly in balance. So while I found the portion a little on the small side for the price, I would without question order it again.Ceviche de Atun: Fresh Tuna, Lime, Olive Oil, Watermelon, Chive and Habanero Mignonette ($10)Good but not something I would order again. For $10, there was very little tuna in the dish, and the habanero mignonette was so spicy I couldn't appreciate the delicate flavours of the melon and mild fish. The combination definitely has great potential, but the exact composition could use adjustment.Tacos Baja: Crispy Fried Haddock, Red Slaw, Chipotle Dip, Salsa Roja, Flour Tortilla ($15 for 3) A big time favourite at the table. The fish was light and moist with a blissfully crispy batter. The chipotle dip, albeit a bit excessive in ratio with the rest of the ingredients, was admittedly ridiculously addictive. I could eat a platter of these without thinking about it.Gringas: Flour Quesadilla with Pastor Pork, Pineapple, Cilantro, Sliced Onion and Mild Gouda Cheese ($9)Tasty, but safe. Unlike most commercial flour tortillas, this one was as light as a crepe. I only wished that there was a little more filling packed in and maybe a bit more caramelization on the outside- something to yield some textural contrast because the dish was a bit one note- mild in flavour and relatively soft in texture.Costilla Corta En Mole Negro: Beef Short Rib Braised 24 Hours with Black Mole Sauce, Sweet Potato Puree, Sauteed Sugar Snap Peas ($14)This was a recommendation of our servers, and I was really glad we went for it. The short rib was impossibly tender and meaty, with very little residual fat to omit. I also loved the pairing of the complex and slightly bitter mole sauce with the light and fragrant sweet potato.Cemita de Pibil Torta: Axiote Braised Pulled Pork, Pickled Red Onion, Chihuahua Cheese, Habanero Glaze ($12)We all took a bite and instantly agreed- it reminded us of Fidel Gastros famous Stg.

For those who know me, my absolute favourite colour is blue. They just make everything look so elegant and precious. I'm literally obsessed with every detail they have from tiles, paint, furniture and fixtures. It's very European, which they are, and I absolutely adore. I never really had the chance to pick out anything other than their hot beverages and a buttered almond croissant here and there, but they most certainly offer items such as baguettes, cupcakes, special donuts, cake, macarons, quiches and salads. Honestly I get so focused and fixated on their restaurant designs that I lose focus on the actual menu itself. I'm don't have much of a sweet tooth so I'm not necessarily drawn to the sweet items like most of my friends do. Other than that, if you enjoy tea they have a wide selection of aromatic teas to choose from. Colette also has a really great patio which is open during the warmer months. It is located on a smaller street in Toronto so if you like a more quiet, outdoor environment to do work you may want to check this place out.

As expected the restaurant was packed even for a weekday so fortunately we had made reservations Prior. We were promptly seated.  For a vegan this place is blessed as all the food options are made vegan friendly - even the pizza is made of cashew mozzarella and gluten free. First off the ginger drink although quite pricey at 14 bucks is excellent and I would highly recommend it if you are looking for a unique cocktail. Next for apps we had ordered the corn hot dog -which was pretty good even for a typical meat eater. I would give it 8/10 and would have preferred that the wiener be inside the bun rather than on top (minor point). We also ordered the kimchi dumplings which I liked since they were crispy but my fiancé found it too oily for her tastes. Next we ordered the habibi salad which according to the vegetarian was very good. I personally found the faffel type balls to be too dry. Next we also ordered the Italian job pizza - which was pretty good but not the same as a normal pizza made with real cheese. Finally for desert we got the chocolate terrataium. The desert was actually very good and I would recommend it and would order it again if I went back. Overall this a great treat for those who are vegan and vegetarian.

Wow - I am still salivating at the memory of my meal here. Now let me start this by saying that I don't particularly enjoy beef - seriously, I just don't. But my friends really wanted me to come here with them because they were sure this would be the place to finally convert me to the pleasures of eating red meat - particularly steak. So I agreed in joining them here for dinner. The hostess showed us to our table and proceeded to explain to us how things work. Basically, there is a salad buffet at the back of the restaurant that has a variety of things like: mashed potatoes, sauteed veggies, fried cassava root, fresh salads, olives, bread, soup, etc,etc,etc..... After you have filled your plate with whatever catches your eye, you proceed to your seat and wait for the very hunky gauchos to bring you unlimited amounts of delicious meat. And you get to check them out while they do this - just make sure your date doesn't catch you (mine did) as this can make things a bit uncomfortable.... Anyway, I tried a large variety of meats including seasoned flank steak, pork loin, Parmesan chicken thighs, fillet Mignon, bacon wrapped fillet Mignon, peppery BBQ ribs, salmon, lamb, steak with cheese, suckling pig, homemade sausages, etc.... so much meat I can't even remember it all. There is a little menu card on the table, and if you see something on there that you'd like to try but haven't, just ask the next gaucho that comes around and they will bring it to you. Oh - and make sure to have the grilled pineapple, not only is it sweet and delicious, but it will aide you in digesting all those massive amounts of meat. Service here was great - all the servers were super friendly and accommodating, and our drinks were refilled continuously. We came on a Friday night, and they have live entertainment. A Brazilian band plus Samba dancers and Capoeira performers. They only have these on weekends, so I guess that's the best time to check this place out. Oh and if you get caught checking out your cute gaucho, fret not. Your date can check out the skimpy dressed Samba dancers and make things even :) Definitely a place worth checking out at least once, but I enjoyed it so much that we are returning in a couple of weeks. I guess I was converted into a full fledged carnivore after all. USEFUL INFO: They will only take reservations for 6 or more people.

They were even nice enough to charge my sister's phone in the office for her. The decor and lighting in here is perfect, upscale yet cozy. I knew we had to have the Singapore Slaw, it is just non negotiable! It was just as delicious as I remembered, it is like every bite is a new flavour experience, considering how many ingredients there are I guess this should not be surprising. It is also a huge amount, I forgot how big it is. I know the price may seem off-putting but just get it, there is no way you would buy and julienne all those ingredients, trust me it is worth every penny.We also got the Indian vegetable Fritters and the Buddha Style Lettuce Cups with Tofu & Veg. I ended up abandoning the lettuce for the lettuce cups and just eating the inside lol I felt like the lettuce was almost taking away from what you really want! The Fritters were delicious, the outside was nice and crispy, I just wish the centre could be a bit crispier, but that may just be a personal preference. The waitress said what we got would be just enough for two people, but honestly it was too much! We would have been fine with the slaw and the fritters alone, so if you're not huge eaters keep this in mind. Our bill came to just over 80.00 with the three items plus one alcoholic beverage, which for a high end restaurant is not shocking. You can save a lot of money by sticking to water.

Ramen shops have been popping up, mostly in the Downtown areas in the past 5 years or so. They make sure to let you know it's authentic by hiring Japanese staff and having Japanese writings. The hype is lost on me. I still give this place a good rating because I think this place makes good ramen. The place is a bit small and if you come at busy times you might not get a seat. But if I review on taste, I really don't see any noticeable difference vs any of the other major ramen shops like sansotei or Raijin.

As a Birthday present, my friend took me to Canoe and it was everything we expected.Upon arrival, a host checked our coats before we were seated. The table gave us a great view of the CN Tower. Since it was after 8:00pm, we were really impressed with the city lights. For a Tuesday evening, Canoe was quite busy with 2 large tables of businessmen and several couples celebrating a romantic occasion. Service is above standard (you would expect it to be at those prices). An explanation of the menu was given, but we already knew that we wanted the Tasting Menu, which included:- Amuse Bouche (the prosciutto melted in my mouth)- Scallop Ceviche (refreshing and zesty)- Artichoke Soup (perfect cream texture)- Intermezzo (to cleanse the pallet)- Main course - I selected the Char (crispy and savoury seared top was amazing)- and a Dessert, Caramel Poached Niagara Pears (a bit sweet for my liking but satisfying).A wine from Ontario or Quebec was paired with each of the courses.Presentation of each course was beautiful, dainty and flowed kind of like scrolled penmanship! Even more impressive then the view was the timing of each course. Completed to perfection. Each time I set down my empty wine glass, a server was there to take it away, give us a slight pause/breather, and bring us the next glass before the next dish.I am a big fan of small plates and trying different items, which is probably why I loved the tasting menu. Not sure how often they change it but if my wallet allowed, I would return for the next version.We left Canoe feeling satisfied and in a blissful state!

The place was on fire as it was jammed from 6:30 onward.  People were coming in and out waiting for take out, waiting for tables, watching our food jealously as their stomachs rumbled.We had a table of 8 so we ordered a lot of apps to start.  The shrimp chips were decently crispy with a nice peppery flavour that lingered on the tongue. The squash chips on the other hand were not as flavourful or exciting, very mild and safe; same sauce for both which was a little boring.  Deep fired sweet potato thingies were okay nothing special.  The salad hand rolls were pretty refreshing as I don't usually like these things, but they were so clean and honest I ate more than I wanted.  Was not a huge fan of their coconut milk, mushroom, basil, chicken soup.  To be fair I don't like coconut milk as it's too sweet for my tastes, but there was something extremely bitter in mine and it was completely off putting.  Everyone else at the table loved it, so it might've just been me.The fried tofu was absolutely delicious!  SUPER flavourful, crispy and utterly mouth watering.  Really surprised when I casually tossed one in my mouth.  Might just be the best tofu I've eaten in a restaurant.  Bam.Onto the mains.  I got the Pad Gra Prao (minced beef on rice with fired egg on top) and it was pretty tasty.  Nothing wow, but a simple, solid, decently made dish.  I wish my egg was bigger, runnier and more awesome.  Should've asked for 3.The braised beef curry was a total disappointment.  The sauce was good. noodles were okay but the beef was tough and chewy, very sad to eat.The best dish of the night was hands down their green thai curry.  Now that was a fantastically put together dish with so many flavours, perfect heat, creamy-ness, coconuty-ness, tender chicken-ness.  Going from one dish to the next, it was clear that this one was in a league of it's own.  A god among peons.There were more dishes but after a while Thai food ends up tasting the same to me.  Blasphemous to some, but truth for me.  I can handle only so much coconut and peanut in one sitting.One knock I have on the place that is completely irrational is their menu.  It's written in such a way that I had a hard time figuring out what I wanted.  First, the Thai names were of no use to me, and neither were the English phonetics.  The descriptions of all the dishes seemed to start off the same with 'coconut milk curry, and ended with beef $ / chicken $'.

The first was really good, but second and third went tumbling downhill at an alarming rate.  Yeah, the atmosphere is energetic.  Sure, the open concept kitchen is entertaining.  FINE, the Sake Mojito is highly chuggable.  But, very quickly the food went very sub-par.A year later, I had a dinner to attend at Guu Sakabar in the Annex.  I was not excited.  I ended up pleasantly surprised.1. There was no wait for 4 people (eek!).  2. The space is really impressively designed.  3. It's mandatory shoes-off (in a particular section), which is totally fun. 4. Our endearing server was literally a Japanese anime character.5. The food was, for the most part, really, really delicious.6. It was shockingly grossly affordable ($100+ tip - and we ordered tons).Gomaae is an unexpected standout.  Blanched spinach with sesame sauce sounds like something your Japanese grandmother might make, but there are lots of complex flavours for a simple dish.  Bright green spinach has a hint of bitterness that balances well with sweet-yet-savoury sesame sauce. While I hatehatehate ordering from a Deep Fried section (please call it something that makes me feel less guilty?), I'd recommend Kabocha Korokke (pumpkin croquette) and Ikapiri (calamari).  The croquette is my favourite dish at Guu.  It's texturally interesting, with a crispy exterior and smooth interior.  It's sweet, smoky and savoury all at once.  And, it's smothered in a sauce that's reminiscent of Mac sauce from McDonald's.  While awkward to eat with chopsticks, it's worth the struggle.  The calamari is perfectly crispy and tasty.  It comes coated in sticky ketchupy glaze and finished with a wasabi mayo drizzle.  A bit more heat from the wasabi would have been nice.I lovelovelove raw fish and rare meat, so I found the Cold Dishes to be stellar.  Maguro Tataki, seared tuna sashimi with ponzu and garlic chips is a dream that money can buy.  But, Gyu Carpaccio, seared beef carpaccio with the same garnishes previously mentioned plus the wasabi mayo we saw elsewhere is... Out.  Of.  Control.  The table fought for it, wolfed it down, and contemplated ordering another, but we chickened out.Here's what I would avoid:  Edamame that's predictably standard, Seaweed Salad that's more watery lettuce than seaweed, Gingara, miso-marinated grilled black cod, that's bland, and Kinoko Bibimbap, a vegetarian rice dish, that never became crisp from the sizzling bowl it's served in.The only true complaint I do have was pacing of the meal.  Guu enforces a 2-hour maximum mealtime, but we finished shy of an hour.  Our abundance of dishes could have been more thoughtfully paired, served, and spaced out.  It would have made a huge difference.If you're going to eat at Guu, go to SakaBar in the Annex.

Not the best first impression and will probably not be back.  My experiences at Khao San Road have been far superior in food and service.---I've been meaning to try Pai for a long time now since it received so much hype a few months ago. The vibe and food from the restaurant reminds me a lot of Khao San Road with slight differences.  I came here on a Sunday night at 6:30pm for a group of 4 and we did make reservations 3 weeks in advance!  The restaurant is easy to spot on Duncan St. but there's limited parking on the actual street.  You may find better luck parking on the side streets of Richmond or Adelaide or King... but if you're up for a further walk, there is actually free parking just north of Queen.  The restaurant itself is bigger than I imagined.  It fits probably 50 people (with reasonable space between the tables) in the dining area and along the bar.  It is in the basement of a building though and there is patio seating.  It's pretty loud inside (throughout the entire meal) but that's to be expected.   Our order:Thai Iced Tea - Very sweet but very flavorful.  I would recommend asking for less sugar or waiting for the ice to melt.   Gai Satay - Pretty much just a few chicken pieces on a skewer.  Was not impressed... food came out cold and the peanut sauce is just mediocre.  For 4 people, it's a skewer per person but also $3/skewer!  Sai Ua Platter - Probably my biggest complaint and let-down for the night.  This dish came out cold as well and AFTER our entrees! Our waiter didn't seem that knowledgeable when we asked her what it was and we still had no idea how to eat it when it came.  I wish they explained how we were supposed to enjoy it properly since it came in parts.Khao Soi - My favorite from Khao San Road and definitely not my favorite from Pai.  It was small, very few noodles but a lot of sauce/curry and other stuff but not enough meat.  Disappointed.  Also came out cold...Gaeng Kiaw Wan - The curry itself was flavorful but a little more viscous than I would've liked.  Not enough rice to soak up all the curry (or to share).  The presentation was cool though and we attempted to eat the coconut meat with little success - I think they hollowed it out already.My impression of Pai was average at best for the food portion and I would leave it at that if not for the service we received.  My biggest complaint from the evening came from our COLD food and our waitress' lack of attention.  We ordered two apps and one came AFTER our entrees were already done and someone removed our plates/cutlery.  We asked time and time again but the waitress would just return and say Did you get it yet?.  When we did get our order, we were already upset that it was also cold and we didn't know how to eat it (waitress clearly didn't either).  Needless to say, we didn't leave very satisfied or terribly full. The food portions are relatively small in general so I wouldn't recommend sharing entrees.For the entire meal, we paid almost $80 total before tip (about $20/person) and that's on the high side for Thai food in my opinion.  We sat there for probably 45 mins longer than we should've  just because our app was late.  Even though their menus may be similar, the service and food aren't up to the standard I'm used to at Khao San Road.  After the meal, I posted my disappointment on IG and the owner of Pai actually responded! They apologized and offered me a free entrée if I ever visited the restaurant again.  I appreciate the owner being reactive to my comments, but they should've been more proactive while we were there.  The waitress (and busboys and other wait staff) knew that we were upset so there's no reason why they couldn't have said anything while we were dining; that would've been a more impactful apology. Anyway, for that follow-up, I give them one more star than I think they deserved, but I will still probably not go to Pai again.  I don't live downtown and the journey to venture there is more of a hassle than it's worth.

At $76 it's certainly not cheap, but it's worth every penny. Our waiter, who was extremely knowledgeable about steak and a very good communicator, explained that this farm mostly feeds the cows grass but they also add other grains later on to improve the marbling of the steak. My wife doesn't eat as much meat, so she had the 8-ounce, grass-fed tenderloin from Lindsay, ON, which was leaner. Our waiter's explanation about the aging process of the steak was quite interesting. It has to do mostly with enzymes breaking down over time and improving the flavour. After a certain number of days, this essentially stops happening. The number of days required varies by the type of steak, but most seemed to be in the 40-50 day range. The steak is stored in a humidity-controlled fridge and develops a crust that is removed prior to cooking.With each steak they bring out some salts and sauces. The salts are quite interesting, but I wouldn't over do it, lest you overpower the flavour of the steak. The blue cheese spread is where it's at though! I normally don't like extra spreads and sauces on steak, but this is truly amazing! A steak at Jacobs with just a little bit of this blue cheese spread will be one of the best things you've ever tasted if you're a steak lover. I can't stress this enough.You can get your steak pre-sliced, which is great if you want to share a steak among a group, which is the only way you'd ever order one of the 40-ounce steaks, I would hope! I prefer to cut my own steak, but it's nice to have this option. Both our steaks were done perfectly medium rare. These guys have it down to a science.We started with the caesar salad, which is made from scratch beside your table. This was fun to watch, and it really was the best caesar salad we'd ever had. There is a huge difference between this and your typical restaurant offering. You can really taste the pepper and Worcester sauce in every bite.For sides, we had the green beans with brown butter and almonds and the duck fat french fries. The beans were interesting as they were really crunchy, and they complemented our meal well. The duck fat fries were also good, but it's a very heavy side if you're also eating a massive steak, so it might not have been the best choice for us.Somehow we still managed to order dessert and had the sticky toffee pudding. This was a great dish and the portion size wasn't too big, which was a relief after ordering all of the above. The toffee had a really great flavour and consistency.In terms of drinks, there is a long wine list, quite a few bottled beers available and a number of cocktails. We stuck with the cocktails and enjoyed most of them. The Pilot and the Rusty Nail were our favourites.The service is simply phenomenal. There is attention to every detail. They even clean up your crumbs between courses!I could go on and on about this restaurant, but this is already my longest review ever, so I'll just conclude by saying that if you're a steak lover who lives in the GTA or is visiting Toronto, you absolutely must come here for dinner.

The tofu salad was really good and the beef was fall apart in your mouth soft. For my main I got the aburi sushi which you got to sample a couple of their aburis. Everything was really flavourful and high quality. For dessert, their green tea opera cake was delicious... loved the crunchy layer in between the cake!

We got the polenta fries, mushroom agnolotti and duck liver pate all of which I've seen many recommendations on here for. Everything was just okay. The polenta fries were simple in taste, but unique I guess. It seemed too salty and one dimensional in flavour. The duck liver pate was better, but I've had better pate at other restaurants. Lastly, the mushroom agnolotti was super-flavour packed to the point of being way too salty at parts and also quite oily. I did like the mushrooms around the agnolotti, but the agnolotti itself wasn't my thing. Again, maybe it was just an off night or I had some bad picks.

Settled with a 6:30 pm slot on a Monday evening and although it was relatively busy, you could probably take your chances doing a walk-in on a weekday.Contemporary decor but still had a very classy vibe. Lamb Ribs ($14) - These were delicious but tiny!! 3.5 small lamb ribs (the 4th one was more like a twig with barely any meat) that are tender, mildly flavored with a crispy texture. Not exactly the best value but taste-wise, 4/5  Roasted Red Beets ($13) - I debated whether or not to order this dish pretty much until the very last minute when I decided to just take a leap of faith and trust my fellow Yelpers. So glad I did as it was the highlight of the night. I was hesitant because my boyfriend and I aren't the greatest fan of red beets but you can hardly taste it when mixed with the labneh which had the perfect consistency and creaminess. Served with some delicious barbari bread, this dish is one you don't want to pass up on. 5/5Crispy Squid ($13) - This one was a decent portion but the individual pieces of squid are very small. Lightly fried and the spices and garlic sauce (toum) give it a nice kick. Very flavorful dish overall and tasted great with our rice. Probably one of the least traditional items because frankly, it's basically calamari with some Eastern Mediterranean seasonings. But I wasn't there to judge (nor would I know) how authentic their food was, so 3.5/5 Turkish Manti Dumplings ($14) - I was looking forward to this the most but it ended up being the biggest disappointment of the night. Such a shame. The dumplings were underwhelming to say the least. I actually didn't even know they were filled with eggplant until the fourth one or so because the ones I ate prior had nothing in it. The molasses balanced the yogurt really well but other than that, nothing special. 2/5Tartufata ($30) - Probably the most expensive rice I've ever had.The truffle and mushrooms were decadent and the fried chick peas were amazing. Crispy and flavorful. The rice itself is very ordinary. So all things considered, I can't say it was completely worth it. I wouldn't order it again because I'd like to try their other rice offerings which looked and sounded just as appealing. 4/5Seared Cauliflower ($8) - It's considered to be a side so I'd recommend ordering this with one of their meat dishes (ribeye, lamb shoulder, etc.) because I think it'd compliment it quite well. We just thought cauliflower with duck fat sounded awesome so we couldn't resist and ordered it anyway. I prefer stronger flavors so I loved this but heads up it can be a bit heavy. 4/5As for dessert, we had the Loukmades ($12) - Fantastic! We were pretty full and while waiting, we kept negotiating how many bites each person would take to finish it. Ended up fighting over the last piece. Pretty much burnt honey icecream on a krispy kreme donut (but a different shape). So good and a must-order!! 5/5  Service was lackluster.  Our server was kind and filled our water pretty often but eventually disappeared. We found ourselves waiting a lot - to order dessert, to ask for the bill and to pay. Service shouldn't end after the customer finishes their main course but rather when they walk out the door. Also, typical of many high-end restaurants, they explain what's in every dish but it was spewed out so quickly that a lot of it was incoherent. Didn't really add any value to our dinner.  A little overhyped but I'd come back because their menu still has a few other interesting items I'd like to try.

It can be pretty hard to find a table, but once you do, it's a fun time. Earls has great drinks, but they've recently  gotten rid of a lot of their drink specials. I don't think that this location has happy hour drinks anymore. Despite this, I love their mojitos.The food at Earls is also consistently good. Some of my favourite dishes include the Dynamite prawn rolls, the chicken caesar salad, the chicken and brie sandwich and the hunan kung pao. The fries are generally awesome, aside from the odd time where the oil hasn't been changed, and they're overly greasy and soggy. The food is nothing particularly mind blowing, but it's consistent and the ingredients are fresh. The service at Earls, however, is totally hit or miss.

Walking to Jimmy's for coffee for the last little while, I had been keeping a close look out on when this place would be opened and when it finally did, I hardly waited before stepping into this gorgeous industrial space, will of beautiful lighting, high ceilings and wooden furniture that gives it a rustic, yet comfortable feeling.On my first visit, I came with a friend just for drinks. The hostess and waitress were overly excited and happy.. a little overbearing, i have to say.. I felt like they were forcing their smiles on me. Their menu is large collection of papers pinned to a clipboard so it was difficult locating where the cocktails were... so I asked out server, and she pointed me to the.... GRAPPAS. I'm not an expert with names, concoctions, or Italian, but I know that Grappas are sweet wines, and not cocktails. Good thing I had read Natalie T's reviews and were able to locate her recommendations and made an executive decision to try their ultra strong drink - the one with the orange bitters (can't remember it's name). It was very strong as I had anticipated, though I have to say the size of the cocktail cup was quite small for the price. I also had a negroni americano (campari, vermouth, soda) and I thought it was made very nicely. Everything that came out of the kitchen smelled incredible and I was really excited to come back for the food. We had been sat along the wall with the banquet and I must say that the tables are WAY too close. I can't say I'm a big girl and I could barely squeeze out feeling like I was intruding on the table next to us.On my second visit, I took my BFF here for her birthday dinner (her choice, but I was definitely excited to finally taste what I had been smelling on my first visit). It was around 6:30 and there were probably 5 tables available. Not wanting to sit along the squished banquette tables, we were lucky to get a table on the main centre aisle, although there wasn't a lot of extra breathing room with people walking by and my chair getting banged several times, and people would be bring chairs across the restaurant and I thought that I was going to get hit in the head. Our waiter was very courteous, and very knowledgeable of everything on the menu. We got the escarole salad to start with walnuts, onion and truffle vinaigrette ($9.95). The escarole had a beautiful crunch to it and a lovely scent of truffle with every bite. The walnuts and onion added some punch and bite and I thought it was a lovely start to our meals.For the mains, I got the 3-mushroom parppadelle with truffle paste and light cream - I was told that it would be very mushroomy and I was very excited because I don't eat them very often - portebello, oyster, porcini ($14.95). When it arrived, I was actually disappointed to see that there were hardly any mushroom PIECES (maybe 3 - 4 little ones), but other than that, thee pasta dish contained mushroom shavings that created the overall taste. The dish was very tasty, not overly heavy and a good texture, but can't say I was completely satisfied. The pasta is NOT made in house, but I was told it was fresh.....My bf got the brandzino ($21.95), which the fish is seared in house (making it super fresh). It was recommended by our server so she went with that. I have to say that this dish was very good, with a very evident citrus coating that erupted your taste buds. The sauteed greens were nice and crunchy, and I preferred her dish over mine in the end.We decided to try the desserts because the waiter really did sell them well. Knowing that they were little bites in the size similar to a shot glass, we got the lemon ice and the chocolate fudge brownie with caramel sauce and rock salt. If I had known that it was $3.95 / shot, I would have passed because I didn't think it was worth it at all. The lemon air was pretty much that in a shot glass. I didn't feel like there was any substance to it although there was a very potent lemon taste. Nothing really sat on my tongue as it evaporated in an instant. There were little pieces of lemon jelly that had a lot of flavour, but that was it. The chocolate dessert came in a very cute little jar, but only half full. It was very dense, and lacking caramel sauce. The rock salt was extremely overpowering so if you didn't know (which I didn't) and took very little chocolate in your bite, it would really turn you off.Having been here twice, I was sooooo excited to try their in house made wine. The first time I came, they were out and told me that it would be by the end of the next week. I came two weeks later on my second visit, only to find out that they still did not have any wine and it wouldn't be ready until... the following week. Unfortunately, maybe I'm just going to wait it out and hope that the next time someone suggests to eat here, the wine will be back.Highlight - FOCACCIA BREAD TO START. Delicious!

The first was really good, but second and third went tumbling downhill at an alarming rate.  Yeah, the atmosphere is energetic.  Sure, the open concept kitchen is entertaining.  FINE, the Sake Mojito is highly chuggable.  But, very quickly the food went very sub-par.A year later, I had a dinner to attend at Guu Sakabar in the Annex.  I was not excited.  I ended up pleasantly surprised.1. There was no wait for 4 people (eek!).  2. The space is really impressively designed.  3. It's mandatory shoes-off (in a particular section), which is totally fun. 4. Our endearing server was literally a Japanese anime character.5. The food was, for the most part, really, really delicious.6. It was shockingly grossly affordable ($100+ tip - and we ordered tons).Gomaae is an unexpected standout.  Blanched spinach with sesame sauce sounds like something your Japanese grandmother might make, but there are lots of complex flavours for a simple dish.  Bright green spinach has a hint of bitterness that balances well with sweet-yet-savoury sesame sauce. While I hatehatehate ordering from a Deep Fried section (please call it something that makes me feel less guilty?), I'd recommend Kabocha Korokke (pumpkin croquette) and Ikapiri (calamari).  The croquette is my favourite dish at Guu.  It's texturally interesting, with a crispy exterior and smooth interior.  It's sweet, smoky and savoury all at once.  And, it's smothered in a sauce that's reminiscent of Mac sauce from McDonald's.  While awkward to eat with chopsticks, it's worth the struggle.  The calamari is perfectly crispy and tasty.  It comes coated in sticky ketchupy glaze and finished with a wasabi mayo drizzle.  A bit more heat from the wasabi would have been nice.I lovelovelove raw fish and rare meat, so I found the Cold Dishes to be stellar.  Maguro Tataki, seared tuna sashimi with ponzu and garlic chips is a dream that money can buy.  But, Gyu Carpaccio, seared beef carpaccio with the same garnishes previously mentioned plus the wasabi mayo we saw elsewhere is... Out.  Of.  Control.  The table fought for it, wolfed it down, and contemplated ordering another, but we chickened out.Here's what I would avoid:  Edamame that's predictably standard, Seaweed Salad that's more watery lettuce than seaweed, Gingara, miso-marinated grilled black cod, that's bland, and Kinoko Bibimbap, a vegetarian rice dish, that never became crisp from the sizzling bowl it's served in.The only true complaint I do have was pacing of the meal.

The Food: the ingredients always taste fresh and are cooked perfectly. Portion sizes are absolutely perfect - generous but not so big you have to leave food on the plate. Their use of spices is impeccable, balanced and flavourful (and with varying degrees of heat for you to choose) - it truly does not get any better than this.- Their pad thai is excellent and properly made with the right ingredients (tamarind, pickled radish, etc - not ketchup or hot sauce).- Their curries are the best I've ever had in my life - the green curry with fish is light and refreshing; the panang beef curry is creamy and rich. Even the accompanying plain steamed rice is tasty. - Their salads are a lighter summer option, consisting of stir-fried ground meat with spices, served with steamed rice, that you can make into little burritos with the giant lettuce leaves.The Ambiance/Service: Very neat little basement-type restaurant, amazing relaxing decor, with wooden tables and fun colourful decorations. It transports you to another place - you could easily be on a tropical island rather than in the downtown core. The service has been consistently good, their servers being generally helpful with respect to the food. Pai is in a league of its own in terms of good Toronto restaurants. A must-try that I recommend to anyone in the city, either living here or passing through. Usually a busy spot, and for good reason - it is well worth the wait, and that is saying a lot when an hour of most people's time in the Toronto core does not come cheap.

Was taken here by a lover and had absolutely no expectations. When I first entered Byblos I was endeared by their lovely decor and ambience, you could tell that great thought was put into the design, flow and layout of this place. The place fills up real quick during the nights and the night I came had many tables reserved. The food portions are adequate and fills you up without leaving too heavy of an after taste. The flavor pairings of the dishes were very well though out beginning with waitress' recommendation of fig salad; the herbs and leafs in this was so fresh I almost felt like I was eating it straight from the plant. The sauces and seasoning was so eloquently used that everything balanced out so well, not ashamed to say that I quickly chowed down the entire plate in mere seconds. Next I had the crispy squid, similar to calamari but a little lighter and smaller tentacles. Also had the steak tartare paired with greek yogurt (they call it labneh) which melted in your mouth, albeit being a little plain. The lamb rib felt a little stingy; each bone was probably one bite-size, nothing special.Probably the best dish tonight was the oxtail basmati rice, a little on the heavy size, it was aromatic, creamy and rich. The flavour of the oxtail was imbued into each scoop of the yellow golden rice, while the kale offered a variation in texture with every mouthful. This I am definitely coming back for.To finish had the chocolate mousse and burnt honey ice cream. Mousse was typical, but the ice cream was interesting - I actually don't know how they got that flavour so on point! Must try (and it's only $3).An amazing discovery I had tonight was dukkah: crushed hazelnuts, coriander seeds, sesame seeds, cumin. The texture and aroma of this garnish is addictive, and Byblos isn't afraid to abuse their dukkah. I left craving for more, and now I'm in the search for making some at home.

I had always ordered a couple of staples, which were cooked reasonably well and filled the void in my stomach.However (and this is a big however), I have since lowered them to 1 star. If I could give them no stars, I would. I eat here fairly frequently, at least once sometimes twice a month and I don't even live in Toronto. Last month I ordered the soup and sandwich deal and was told the soup of the day was either tomato chickpea and cream of broccoli. I usually quite enjoy their cream of broccoli soup, but what I was served (both taste and texture) was more like a wilted old lettuce soup. It was disgusting. I kept trying to eat it, thinking to myself - there's something wrong with this soup. My mother-in-law was the first to pipe up to our waitress about it (whom we tried to track down for a good 10 minutes because no one ever checks on their tables there). There's something wrong with the soup, I tell her. Oh, no there's nothing wrong with it - it's actually asparagus soup and I just forgot to tell you. Exact words. Not paraphrasing. It was disgusting. I was brought the dreadful tasting tomato chickpea soup instead and just couldn't bring myself to finish it.And this is just the beginning because - wait - there's more. Last week I went in again and decided to order the Phad Thai. Big mistake. I have had the dish before both there as well as from many other restaurants in the Greater Toronto area and have always quite liked the dish.  The dish had two pictures of chilli peppers next to it, which most restaurants have despite the dish being more sweet than it is spicy. I took a bit of it and almost threw up. There was no flavour there - it was just spice. I complained to the waitress who at first gave me a bit of attitude but said I could order something else. I had a strange feeling so I said Are you planning on charging me for this food I can't eat?. Of course I am, there's nothing wrong with it. She replies haughtily. I tried to explain that it was beyond hot and that it was nearly impossible to eat. It's not normally like this. Well that's not our fault, its yours because you didn't read the menu. I was aghast and she even brought the menu over to point out the two chilli peppers. She was beyond being explained to and was at a point where she was arguing with me, not letting me speak and telling me that it was my fault.She kept telling me I had to pay for a meal that was inedible even by the poorest of standards so I ended up walking out. I had at one point even asked to speak to the owner or manager. She actually smiled at me, crossed her arms and said they weren't in that day. She said she was in charge and that's just the way things are.I have never been treated so rudely at a restaurant before in my life. Yes, the prices are good and the servings are large - but the service is gawd awful to the point where they should be reported to the Better Business Bureau. The atmosphere is tolerable on some days and  rank the next - the music being the most obvious culprit. With no standards as to what can and will be played you can be tortured with just about anything your nightmares can come up with - and mid lunch, I just don't want to hear a skipping CD of some woman who is swinging a cat by the tail to drums when all I want to do is listen to the person across the table from me tell me a story.For the average student this place may be fine as long as you never have a complaint and stick to the same meal each time. Never complain because it's the customers fault, not the kitchens. Bring some ear plugs or your MP3 player and last but not least, shut up and eat the food they give you....or else....or else you can just skip it altogether. Probably your best plan of action.

Byblos primarily focuses on eastern Mediterranean cuisine but they add a Canadian/North American twist to it, which I find pretty cool. Finding this restaurant was definitely interesting. The entrance to the restaurant was an shelter with a small door made out of nylon, canvas, etc. It looked it I was about to enter a club. The restaurant is definitely beautiful.

It was by no means bad, but I didn't find anything remarkable about my food. After returning for a second time and trying a few other things, I kind of get it. I came with two friends on Friday and this time was seated in the room on the lower floor. This room is definitely more intimate and quieter than the main dining room, although less interesting to look at. To start, we ordered the fried calamari, which was actually really, really good. It was just lightly breaded, so it wasn't like the dough overwhelmed the taste of the squid. And I'm so glad it didn't, because the squid was fantastic! It tasted really fresh, and then the texture of it was just perfect - chewy and tender, but still quite soft and moist. Squeeze a bit of lemon juice on it, and it is just amazing. For my main, I tried the seafood spaghetti which everyone raves about. I kind of wish it came with a different kind of pasta, because spaghetti just seems so basic. That being said, it was a good pasta - the texture of the pasta was great, and once again, the seafood, which included clams, mussels, scallops, shrimp, and calamari was very fresh, sizeable (the shrimp were huge), and plentiful. I honestly can't get over the texture of their calamari in general, it's just so good. I will say that I thought the portion was a little bit on the smaller side for dinner though. I also sampled a bit of my friends' dishes. One got the pappardelle del iosa which comes with spicy sausage. One bite wasn't too spicy, but I think it would build up. I thought this was okay. My other friend ordered off the special menu for the day, and got pappardelle made with spinach (so the noodles were green) and which came with duck confit. I liked this one better, because I found the duck to be more flavourful than the sausage, although a bit on the salty side. Also the noodles were a bit firmer in this dish.For dessert, we split some kind of sponge cake thing which had limoncello and mascarpone. I quite enjoyed this, because it was very light and fluffy, not too sweet, and had quite a delicious zesty flavour. It was actually the perfect dessert for me and I would recommend.The takeaway from this is that Terroni knows how to do seafood right. Get the calamari and the seafood pasta, and you'll be impressed.

I have to admit the seats were a bit uncomfortable as the wood panelled banquets were awkwardly angled at least they had some sort of cushion and the small table seemed to be at awkward height as well but nothing I couldn't manage. Kim came back and delivered us the menus, informed us of the specials, and brought us a pitcher of ice water with sliced cucumbers inside which was a nice touch. They also have daily specials that change all the time but we both knew what we wanted the jerk chicken dinners. We asked to sub the jasmine rice that it comes with for peas and rice and Kim said no problem. I thought there would be an extra cost to do that but surprisingly there wasn't. Kim asked if we like our jerk chicken spicy or mild and we both wanted spicy. She also explained that they grill the chicken made to order so it may take a while. We were both cool with that as hearing our food was not precooked and being made fresh for us was another bonus.Kim was really nice and chatted with us and keep us posted on the status of meals. What was also nice to see was as guests came in you could see that they were all regulars as she greeted them by name and had there drink orders memorized.When our meal finally arrived I was in heaven. After that first bite of chicken I knew why there were soo many regulars and why it was so raved about. Seriously some the best jerk chicken i've ever had! The chicken itself was soo juicy and tender, seasoning was perfect, nice grill flavour, and the heat was good without being too much. What I also loved about this chicken was it was all boneless chicken, mostly thigh meat, and not saucy so you get that nice dry jerk seasoning through the moist tender meat. The meal also came served with a garden salad and homemade coleslaw. Normally I hate coleslaw but this one was pretty good, not too creamy and it had a nice tangy sweet and sour flavour. The peas and rice were also really good and the hidden gem in this dish was the bit of oxtail gravy over the rice and a little piece of oxtail with bone. The oxtail was also amazing, so tender and flavourful you could tell they really stewed it well. It was such a nice surprise to find it under the chicken but such a tease because it was soo good it made me want more.At the end of our meal we were highly satisfied. The portion was ample with lots meat and we definitely fulfilled our jerk chicken craving. This restaurant is also really affordable I think our meal was $11 each which I thought was a total steal! Fresh, flavourful food and a waitress that's soo warm and welcoming you can totally see why so many people keep coming back here. I will definitely be returning to get my jerk chicken fix and to try the oxtail dinner! ANSWERNOTFOUND",$ 11,"(3420, 3423)",1,0.0,False

This was my first time at the restaurant. Our server, Stephani, was excellent. I was also very impressed with the decor. However, I was not impressed by the food, especially given the high price. The Baja tacos were flavorful but the use of a flour tortilla rather than a corn tortilla took away from the experience. I think you would struggle to find a taquiera that uses flour tortillas with fish tacos, as these are usually reserved for grilled meat fillings. The Yucatan Cochinita Pibil was very dry on the inside, but the whole taco was unreasonably wet with juices. I was disappointed to see the use of one rather than two corn tortillas per taco, as is the practice amongst some taquieras, depending on the consistency of the filling. At over $5.00 per taco, I was expecting much better food. I understand that part of the draw is the location, decor, and outdoor heated patio, but I would have a tough time believing that any Mexican would dine at your restaurant for the tacos. I have been to taquieras in Tijuana, Mexico and California that served cheap and more satisfying tacos than the ones I had tonight.The double mojito was great, no complaints. It was $14.00 but I didn't think that was as unreasonable as the price of the tacos.Perhaps I missed something better on the menu. I would be amendable to giving your restaurant a second chance, but based on this experience, I have a tough time justifying it or recommending it to friends or colleagues.The total bill came to $63.17. This would buy about 20 tacos, plus drinks, at somewhere like El Trompo in Kensington Market (run by a Mexican family). If that is a little too no-frills to make a comparison, take La Carnita's tacos, for example. Although their tacos are not what one may call authentic, they taste a whole lot better than yours at a slightly reduced price.I know that Olivier La Calvez is a highly trained chef, but totally missed the mark on these tacos. I can't believe he would put his name to them.I haven't been this upset about a restaurant experience in ages, and I am certainly not a picky customer. It is not a good feeling when you feel like your money went to the decor, rather than quality food. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2321, 2335)",5,0.0,False

The arincini was so delectable. I like that they kept it simple. Risotto, cheese, crispy breading. Super sweet tomato sauce to accompany. Pasta - in order of best to good. Amertricana- insane. The crispy pancetta was a thing of beauty. Pesto and walnut something - such a lovely dish. Nutty, light, but filling. I know, a major contradiction but trust me. Ricotta gnocchi- pillows of heaven. I almost wish they were more tough, but I can't hate on a pillowy gnocchi. I do wish there was more chili as the description promised. Cacio e pepe- not enough pepper.

My companions loved this one and while I thought it was delicious, I don't love lamb and probably would prefer beef (personal preference, so not a knock on the dish).

Music is great, portions are very generous and servers are very laid back yet attentive.  I do have some criticism following my most recent visit which I'll leave to the end.  Let's start off with the goodies first.Golden Hashbrown Poutine - Not your average poutine but definitely worth a try if you love any form of potato and like to try new things.  Their gravy is on point and if you also don't mind runny eggs, this is definitely a must try.  The two compliment each other quite well.  With the runny eggs, do keep in mind that if prefer your eggs cooked, they can't cater to this.  Alterations are actually not accepted here so be sure to read the menu to avoid disappointment.  Anywho, although this wasn't my order, I would personally go back for this. 5/5. Super Cheesy Bacon French Toast - If you can't decide between sweet or savoury, order this.  Not only will this dish satisfy both palettes, it'll keep your belly happy for most of your day.  What also goes perfectly with this would be their side of greens which, I find, helps cleanse your palette after every bite.  Think of it as the ginger slices with your sushi.  5/5.Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffles - This was the first place in Toronto where I've had chicken & waffles.  Although I've had *the original* c&w at Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles, this is not too shabby.  Waffles are nice and fluffy, chicken is nice and crispy on the outside yet juicy on the inside.  Roscoe's is still my fave but this is definitely next in line.  I have however, have yet to try other places. 4/5. I've had a few other things here but they are no longer on the menu.  But if you're curious, they were all still quite good.  Place is also great for small events including small weddings.  Had actually attended one a couple of years ago and the purpose of my last visit was to also scope out the place for another potential wedding.  It was my friend's (bride to be) first visit here and hopefully the experience during that last visit didn't take them off the list.Now I'd like to just go over the little criticism that I had first mentioned.  The only criticism I have about the place is the fact that they don't take reservations for brunch but then again, that's the norm at Liberty Village restaurants that offer brunch.  However, when you're waiting for your table during the colder days of Toronto, it's not exactly pleasant. They have this nice patio area at the front which would be very ideal for people to wait so perhaps management would look into investing in some of those heaters for their waiting customers? I understand that you can get a text when your table is ready but you need to also consider the fact that your customers are paying for parking and there aren't too many places to kill time around there that aren't restaurants.And speaking of waiting for your table, when we went here this past Sunday, the host told me that they generally give those next in line 5 to 10 minutes to get back before they release their table.  Well, over 20 minutes had passed when the party finally arrived.  Quite unfair to everyone else who have been waiting in the cold and/or cramped up waiting area.  Also with the waiting area which is really the space between the door and the host being cramped, there must be some fire code violation here. Anyway, maybe just something for management to consider.

Regardless of the day or time, this place is always packed but trust me the wait was absolutely worth it. I guess what made this place really stand out is the environment. Once you step through those doors, you are literally transformed into a different world. It felt like you just nested into the heart of small Tokyo bar. This place is really ALIVE with all the sights and sounds of what a real Japanese restaurant should be like. Just on the environment alone, I already fell in love with this place. I wish we sat at the bar however, it would be so fascinating to watch the cooks & staff interact with each other. They seem like the really love what they are doing and  just by that, you know the food would definitely deliver.So, we ordered a couple of things.

We ordered:Bread (free) - warm and buttery goodness!The infamous caesar salad - I was super impressed with the amount of ingredients that was in the salad and that it took the server about 15 minutes to make it in front of us. My only tip for improvement is to indicate on the menu that the salad is spicy because tabasco sauce is added. If I knew this, I would have asked for that to be omitted since I am a weaksauce for spice. We didn't see all the ingredients on her table either.

It was pretty fatty to me and to be honest, I was too spoiled by the Striploin to truly think anything else could be better. However, the ribeye was very nicely flavoured and definitely a steak better than ruth chris or the keg, in my opinion. 4/5They also gave us a bunch of sauces, honey goat cheese, and other condiments, but we really didn't need them at all. In fact, we thought the sauces and such ruined the taste of the steak so we didn't use them.2oz Foie Gras - This was pretty delicious and flavourful. I haven't had foie gras in years so I can't really compare, but this was very juicy and tender. 4/5Chocolate Walnut Brownie - this was amazing!!! Rich chocolatey flavour brownie with lots of walnuts. The ice cream was toasted marshmallow, which is pretty unique. There was a long piece of marshmallow, which added to the favour of this dessert. ME LIKIE! 5/5Two chocolate sweets (free) -  a nice touch. if you just wanted a bit of sweetness and don't want to spend on dessert (or you rather get something else for this price) then this is good enough!All of this was followed by the infamous chocolate chip muffins that we got to take home for the next day. They were delicious when we both had it for breakie! Soft and moist!We left super full and then some. The bill came up to around $300 with tax and tip. We didn't get alcohol. Definitely a fine dining restaurant that served its purpose of a special night out to celebrate a special occasion. My bf loved it!This may be TMI, but the following day, my stomach was in knots. I suspect it was the amount of richness and butter that was used to prepare the food. I don't normally eat a lot of butter so it makes sense why I was having gastro issues the next day. My bf was completely fine and woke up still full from the night before!  A fine restaurant that gets you that full - BONUS! ;)Finally, we had leftover ribeye and duck fries that we ate 3 days later. We fried the steak a bit to heat it up and it was STILL as delicious as the day we tried it. The fries were a little soggy, but edible.Overall, I would definitely recommend Jacob and Co for a special occasion or for the steak lovers out there. Definitely one of the best steakhouses in Toronto! ANSWERNOTFOUND",4/5We decided to get two steaks to share so we could try a little bit of each,"(2034, 2111)",2,0.5,False

Every visit has been great. I love everything about this place!My most recent visit was at 9 pm on a Saturday night with my friend for a girls' night out. I made the reservation a week in advance, and the only options were for 5:45 pm, 9 pm or 10 pm - and that was a full week in advance! So, if you want to try this place, and want to sit inside I highly recommend making a reservation early!With reservations, you will be seated inside, but there is also an extensive and very festive outside seating area that appears to be first come first served. (And seasonal....) When we arrived at 8:55 pm, the line was very long and the entire outdoor area was packed; when we left at 11 pm, the line was STILL long and the outdoor area STILL packed, so that should tell you something!We started our dining experience with table-side-fresh-made guacamole which is served with fresh-made chips, and traditional margaritas. Our server, Ricardo, was excellent, and our guac came out quick. The person prepping it ground all the ingredients together right in front of us in a stone mortar. I love it when they do that! And it was very tasty, seasoned well, and a good portion size for sharing (though we had to ask for more chips).We then ordered mains off the list of house specialties. I had the Pulpo A La Diabla, which was a grilled octopus tentacle served with picked veggies, slices of orange and a tangy, slightly spicy tomato-based sauce. It was amazing! Ricardo let me know when I ordered it that it was a smaller portion size, and that was perfect for me because I planned to have dessert and at least one more margarita....My friend had the Pipian Poblano, which was actually a chicken dish with a large piece of chicken served over a bed of mole verde risotto. Ricardo told us this was a larger portion size and he was right - it was huge! And very tasty, with great depth of flavors. My friend loved it and almost licked the bowl. Everything was served with three house-made sauces - a very spicy but delicious habanero sauce, a green tomatillo salsa and a red (sweeter) chipotle-ish sauce. We ate these with the chips and also added them to our dishes. During our dinner we ordered another round of drinks - another traditional for my friend, but I branched out to try the Fuego Sandia, made with St. Germaine (my fave) and what tasted like watermelon juice. It was served with a skewer of watermelon and Ricardo described the drink as 'sweet'. He was right again!  And I probably would not order that again....not that it wasn't tasty, but I do prefer drinks with a little more balance.By the time all of that was cleared, we, sadly, (very sadly) had no room for dessert. But we really enjoyed everything about the experience. All around us people were celebrating events and birthdays, there were couples and groups dining together, and the atmosphere was hip and a little fancy, but also comfortable and eclectic.

It did seem more intimate / more suitable for one on one dining and drinks, I did not see many groups of friends at a table. My first experience with Insomnia was through food delivery. I wanted to come in and experience the full package so my boyfriend and I had reservations for a Saturday night. We were greeted and seated immediately, right by the windows facing Bloor st. The restaurant was dim and romantic, but the street lights coming in added a nice touch to the ambience.Our server, Raza (not sure how to spell her name, sorry!!), was very friendly and informative. We ordered everything she recommended and we loved every dish. She also mentioned how their Old Fashioned is more traditional, and how they have a regular who comes in exclusively for the old fashioneds. I've had my fair share of Old Fashioneds and this is one of my favourites (they use 1 big square cube of ice rather than regular ice cubes!).To start we ordered the mussels, and Raza recommended we get their complimentary bread to dip. The bread isnt listed on the menu with the dish as the mussels are noted gluten free, but it is a very highly recommended option! The mussels were soo good, and didn't have any grimey seafood scents or flavour. The sauce the mussels were soaked in was creamy, but not overly rich. We also tried the calamari, and it was good, but the mussels were my favourite out of the two.For our entree, my boyfriend was debating between chicken and waffles or their spicy penne. Our server mentioned the owner of Insomnia is also the co-owner of Dirty Bird, so the chicken and waffles are the same recipe. He immediately chose the chicken and waffles. I heard Insomnia is known for their signature Insomnia burgers, but I was in the mood for pasta. Raza said the rose sauce shrimp linguine was her favourite, so I went with that. I highly recommend the shrimp linguine with rose sauce, especially if you're hungry. The portion was huge, and I really wanted to keep eating it but I couldn't finish. I got a second drink after my old fashioned, called Smoking Gun. It wasnt too sweet, nor tasted overwhelmingly of bourbon. It was a luxurious orange chocolate cocktail with an even better aftertaste, and I love how they fill the beverage up to its rims!I would say Insomnia is the perfect date night spot, or a great place to enjoy a cocktail or two (they also have a long list of intricate cocktails + the usual beer and wine) catching up with your friends.

The place is pricey, but it's worth it for the quality of food and service. Overall, I had an amazing time at Miku!Here is a small breakdown of what I ordered and my thoughts on it:Albacore Tuna and Wakame Tartare ($18) - thought this tasted pretty good. The tuna was fresh, and it came with avocados which is my favourite. It was a cool item to try, but I probably wouldn't buy it again.Salmon Oshi Sushi ($17) - this was the best part of my dinner and I would honestly come back just to buy this again. I absolutely love it! And you probably won't be able to find aburi sushi like this in Toronto (other than at JaBistro).Red Wave Roll ($18) & Miku Roll ($22) - got 1/2 of each. Both were must haves!! I personally enjoyed the red wave roll much more though (not a big fan of uni, but I LOVE tuna). Aburi Sushi Sampler ($20) - perfect dish to start off with because you get to try a variety of different things! I'd totally recommend this to anyone who's in for trying something new.Atlantic Salmon Sashimi (6 pieces for $16) - salmon sashimi has always been one of my favourite things to eat, but I didn't find anything too special about the sashimi here. Tasted great, fresh, but not TO DIE FOR or anything like that! Just average.Uni (Sea Urchin) and Cho Toro (Tuna Belly) at market prices - I LOVED the tuna so much!! I want to go back just to have more! Didn't enjoy the uni at all though. It was my first time trying it, and it tastes extremely seafoody! It's a bit of an acquired taste and was certainly not right for me.Green Tea Opera Dessert ($13) - the green tea ice cream tasted pretty regular to me, but the CAKE with many layers to it was absolutely delicious!

But given that we had theater tickets one Friday night, the time was finally right to sample Byblos' much-ballyhooed wares.We arrived at around 6:15 and we promptly shown to our reserved table near the front. Our very helpful waitress appeared shortly after and we began the slow process of figuring out just what to eat. We ultimately chose six items:Duck Kibbeh (dried fig + date molasses + tahini): This was easily the highlight of the entire meal. I've eaten plenty of kibbeh over my lifetime but this is unquestionably the tastiest version of this venerable dish I've ever had. Everything was perfect, from the delectable spices to the unctuous, melt-in-your-mouth meat to the note-perfect sauce. Just astounding.Spanish Octopus (fingerling potato + biber chili vinaigrette + preserved lemon): Although the octopus was cooked about as well as I've ever had it - the octopus at Bar Isabel, for example, was far chewier - there was nothing about this dish that really stood out. Perhaps it's because it came on the heels of the sublime Duck Kibbeh, but there was nothing here that really blew me away in terms of flavor - although the presentation was quite nice.Sujuk Pide (turkish paste + persian feta + za'atar): I'm a big fan of sujuk (a spicy Middle Eastern sausage), so I was especially excited about this one. It's very good. All the components work extremely well together and the enveloping crust is baked perfectly. I suppose my one complaint is the sujuk itself, which, in addition to not tasting like any sujuk I've ever had, is completely lacking in the heat I've come to associate with the sausage.Mejadra (lentil + hung yogurt + fried shallot): Again, this is something I've been eating my entire life and I have to say, unfortunately, that this dish just didn't measure up. Despite the aforementioned dollop of yogurt, the rice is just dry as heck. It's been cooked in a skillet, which allows the side and bottom rice to get crispy - an idea which sounds great in theory but doesn't really work here. Far more problematic is the fried shallot on top. Traditionally, the shallots (or onions) are taken beyond the point of caramelization, which lends the dish a rich flavor that's unfortunately completely absent here. This was definitely the biggest disappointment for me.Seared Cauliflower (duck fat + tahini sauce + sesame + coriander): This is a very tasty side that's almost workmanlike in its execution. It's well done but it's nothing special, sadly.Turkish Manti Dumplings (smokey eggplant + yogurt sauce + molasses): This incredibly rich dish admittedly goes well with the Mejadra, as it cuts that dryness I mentioned. But it might be just a little too rich; between the heavy yogurt sauce and the sweet molasses, it's impossible to taste the smokey eggplant supposedly contained within the dumplings.All in all, I quite enjoyed my meal at Byblos.

I have to say, the food was unappetizing, except for the rice cakes (but it was overpriced at three spoonfuls for $11). The ginger scallion noodles and the potato dashi ramen had no taste and the pork ramen's broth and the extremely spicy noodles were way over seasoned, especially the latter. We asked the waiter for hot water but they did not have any so she offered extra pork broth as an alternative. That, however, did not help because the broth was sodium in a bowl. Moreover, we were charged for the broth even though it was offered as an alternative for water. The menu was also very confusing. I added Katsu to my noodles, which was $4 extra, but they don't specify which meat it is. I assumed it was going to be pork, since Katsudon is fried pork cutlet over rice, but instead it was chicken, which I do not eat.

I recall the waits at their old location were so long that sometimes I would put my name down and catch a shorter movie nearby and by the time I was out they would be ready to seat moi. But the waits were the norm then until decent Thai food became a regular thing all over and now they have to meet a minimum new standard. The setup is new yet I didn't enjoy the seating on the shared tables. The couples (yes plural) next to us were so close we could hardly talk to each other. The seats aren't comfortable and the service wasn't anything to write home about. Now for the bummer only one type of beer! Really I have had my share of Singha beer in Bangkok's beer gardens since imports are so expensive in Siam but here you should have more options IMO. Ah well moving on to the main event the quality has gone down a lot for khao soi as it was a poor reflection of the glory days. Gone is the tender beef which draws me to this dish. The curry is ok and the bowl they serve it in here isn't as conductive to eating. With a larger and much better option nearby I think I will be skipping this spot.

The menu is surprisingly short for an izakaya (at least from my experience in NYC).My favorite dishes were the kinoko cheese bibimbap and the tori karaage.The kinoko cheese bibimbap was rice served in a sizzling stone pot, mixed with chunky pieces of garlic-sauteed mushrooms, shredded cheese and a super tasty sauce made of seaweed.  It's such a simple but brilliant dish.  Really appetizing and extremely delicious.  The tori karaage was truly succulent and fried to perfection.

We really enjoyed it and was very excited to learn that he had a location here in Toronto. The website let's you book a reservation online, though it doesn't guarantee private seating as they have communal tables and a long counter that wraps around half the restaurant with bar stools. It has a cozy romantic type of atmosphere with dimmed lights. If you sit at the counter along the kitchen, you get to watch the chefs cook and plate some of the dishes. They're efficient and very clean. The servers have always been very polite but not really social when connecting with guests. At times it is confusing to determine who the hostess is as they seem to always be in regular casual clothing (i.e. jeans and shirt). They're quite a popular spot but don't really have a designated waiting area. The building houses the noodle bar on ground floor, the Milk Bar on the second, and they also have a nicer higher end restaurant upstairs which has elevator access.Okay so I didn't really intend to go into so much detail with my thoughts on the actual restaurant.

I ended up getting their pumpkin Ramen, and I have to be honest, I never really ate or drank anything pumpkin (because I'm not basic haha) and don't really have much of an opinion on it. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I really enjoyed it! It had coconut milk in the broth so it was nice and creamy. It had a delicate flavour, not overpowering. I wasn't a big fan of the hard chunks of pumpkin that was in it but of course it's only because I never really ate it. It was a very interesting twist on Ramen so I liked the variety. We also had the braised beef baos and oh man are they soft and fluffy. The meat just falls apart with every bite and is deliciously coated in a light sauce.

I've been coming here for years. When this place first opened and the original owners were still here, I think I came 5-6 times a month. I was addicted. The last few times, I started seeing some changes. I didn't think much of it until I started noticing the food quality going down.

I noticed there were some new spice levels. So I asked for Thai spicy. Immediately the waitress gave me this look and asked if I had that level before. Technically I haven't because I haven't had to order a level before. She immediately followed up her question with because if you find it too spicy we won't fix it for you. WTF. 1) I just wanted it as spicy as it used to be. 2) I don't know how spicy is your Thai spicy without trying it first and 3) learn some customer service skills before you work in this industry.

The squash fritters tasted pre-fried and sitting out for awhile and the pad gra prao was under seasoned. Are they using Thai basil now or something? It's definitely different.

The boyfriend ordered Grilled calamari stuffed w/ risotto, Rib eye steak, and tiramisu for dessert (they misspelled tiramisu as tiramusi on the menu, which was such a turn off). I also ordered their special cocktail for the event, called Cabana. It tasted like a fruit punch. WHERE'S THE VODKA?!?!?!?!1. Appetizers: I have to admit that their Lobster soup was yummy. It's the best part of my sub-par dining experience. My boyfriend's stuffed calamari was also good and the portion was quite generous. 2. Main entrees: My lobster tail was quite big and grilled to perfection. The only thing I disliked about my main was the fettuccine. I like my pasta well done and it was al dente. It's just my personal preference and it's definitely not their fault. My boyfriend asked for a medium rare rib eye and when it came, he thought it was more of a medium to medium-well. Anyways, it was still a good piece of steak. My only itch about his dish was the veggie side. They used bokchoy out of all the greens out there! Believe me, I love my bokchoy, but NOT with steaks. It's like pairing BBQ pork with arugula. How do you like that? 3. Desserts: I was still upset that they ran out of the mixed berry shortcake and didn't have a fruity-type dessert as a replacement. I couldn't really enjoy the chocolate mousse cake because my first two dishes were already very creamy. I swapped my dessert with my boyfriend's tiramusi (haha!) and I definitely preferred that over the mousse cake. In the end, we didn't finish our dessert because the overall dining experience was just... underwhelming.A couple of things worth mentioning:- Our waiter was nice, attentive, but not annoying.- I noticed that a couple of other tables had some issues with their main courses. The guy beside us didn't finish his steak (1/2 of it was still on the plate) and when the waitress asked whether or not he would like to pack up the rest, he said no. THAT'S NOT A GOOD SIGN. Another table complained about one of the steaks being tough (overcooked?) and asked if they could get a replacement. The waitress tried to defend herself by saying that the steak looked overcooked because of the dim lighting in the restaurant. WTH?!? The patron said it was tough! She didn't even say it looked overcooked, she already tasted it before she complained! Oh boy...Anyway, I wouldn't go back to this place.Well, maybe for the Lobster soup. MAYBE.That's all, folks! :) ANSWERNOTFOUND",the Lobster soup,"(508, 524)",1,0.0,False

I wish I wrote this review earlier, since it has been over a year since I visited The Stockyards.I remember going on a Sunday morning and having to wait close to an hour for counter seating. I vaguely remember it being a cramped and uncomfortable dining experience. But what I do recall vividly is the delicious Fried Chicken and Waffles. I guess it is true what they say about smell/taste being closely associated with memory and emotion. I am from Toronto but lived in Georgia for over 10 years. I've eaten my share of waffles and fried chicken individually, but never together. For the longest time, I viewed the combination as strange and could not imagine it tasting good. Thus I passed up opportunities to eat the dish at famous places like Gladys Knight & Ron's Chicken & Waffles in Atlanta and Roscoe's In LA. Ironically, I tried the combination for the first time at The Stockyards. Who would have thought I would try it for the first time in Canada.The fried chicken is on point. It rivals the fried chicken i've had living down south in Georgia. That's saying a lot, since everything is deep fried in the South. The batter is crispy, light but definitely a little greasy. Don't expect thick crunchy breading or seasoning, since the real focus is on the chicken meat itself. The chicken is tender and incredibly juicy. 3 generous pieces of chicken come with the waffle: 1 leg, 1 breast and 1 drumstick. For $13 bucks, it's a pretty good deal. The waffle is soft, thick and fluffy with a hint of sweetness. It soaks in some of the grease and moisture of the chicken without becoming too soggy or heavy. Overall a decent waffle, but it definitely takes a backseat to the chicken in terms of being the star of the dish. What brings the dish together is the syrup. Described on the menu as chili maple molasses citrus glaze, I will just call it awesome. Without this syrup, I am not sure if the chicken and waffle dish would come together so nicely. It's sweet but also spicy. This kick adds an additional flavor component to the dish and makes eating this chicken an irresistible compulsion. Selling this bottled syrup commercially would make a lot of money. Simply put, the chili maple syrup is the bomb. Anyways, this is definitely a gem of a restaurant in Toronto, where BBQ and American comfort food are generally lacking. I will be back to try their BBQ ribs and burgers. Just be prepared to wait for a seat. Also keep in mind that the seating is not very comfortable, due to the small physical space of the restaurant. Take out is not a horrible idea.

It was not too sweet as the lime balanced out the sweetness of the corn and coconut milk, and the chili lent a subtile hint of spice. -Coffee Smoked Baby Back Ribs: It wasn't my favourite. Normally I don't like coffee in the marinade as it accentuates the bitter and smoky flavors of the rib.

We really enjoyed it and was very excited to learn that he had a location here in Toronto. The website let's you book a reservation online, though it doesn't guarantee private seating as they have communal tables and a long counter that wraps around half the restaurant with bar stools. It has a cozy romantic type of atmosphere with dimmed lights. If you sit at the counter along the kitchen, you get to watch the chefs cook and plate some of the dishes. They're efficient and very clean. The servers have always been very polite but not really social when connecting with guests. At times it is confusing to determine who the hostess is as they seem to always be in regular casual clothing (i.e. jeans and shirt). They're quite a popular spot but don't really have a designated waiting area. The building houses the noodle bar on ground floor, the Milk Bar on the second, and they also have a nicer higher end restaurant upstairs which has elevator access.Okay so I didn't really intend to go into so much detail with my thoughts on the actual restaurant. Now, more importantly, THE FOOD! I've been here a couple times now and each visit I was very impressed. Not only is the plating nice but the food on said plate is even better! On my visit a few weeks ago, the menu has changed slightly offering different types of Ramen dishes. I ended up getting their pumpkin Ramen, and I have to be honest, I never really ate or drank anything pumpkin (because I'm not basic haha) and don't really have much of an opinion on it. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I really enjoyed it! It had coconut milk in the broth so it was nice and creamy. It had a delicate flavour, not overpowering. I wasn't a big fan of the hard chunks of pumpkin that was in it but of course it's only because I never really ate it. It was a very interesting twist on Ramen so I liked the variety. We also had the braised beef baos and oh man are they soft and fluffy. The meat just falls apart with every bite and is deliciously coated in a light sauce. The okonomiyaki is really delicious as well. It's all delicious! Will definitely try to come here when I'm in the downtown area. Happy slurping!

But given that we had theater tickets one Friday night, the time was finally right to sample Byblos' much-ballyhooed wares.We arrived at around 6:15 and we promptly shown to our reserved table near the front. Our very helpful waitress appeared shortly after and we began the slow process of figuring out just what to eat. We ultimately chose six items:Duck Kibbeh (dried fig + date molasses + tahini): This was easily the highlight of the entire meal. I've eaten plenty of kibbeh over my lifetime but this is unquestionably the tastiest version of this venerable dish I've ever had. Everything was perfect, from the delectable spices to the unctuous, melt-in-your-mouth meat to the note-perfect sauce. Just astounding.Spanish Octopus (fingerling potato + biber chili vinaigrette + preserved lemon): Although the octopus was cooked about as well as I've ever had it - the octopus at Bar Isabel, for example, was far chewier - there was nothing about this dish that really stood out. Perhaps it's because it came on the heels of the sublime Duck Kibbeh, but there was nothing here that really blew me away in terms of flavor - although the presentation was quite nice.Sujuk Pide (turkish paste + persian feta + za'atar): I'm a big fan of sujuk (a spicy Middle Eastern sausage), so I was especially excited about this one. It's very good. All the components work extremely well together and the enveloping crust is baked perfectly. I suppose my one complaint is the sujuk itself, which, in addition to not tasting like any sujuk I've ever had, is completely lacking in the heat I've come to associate with the sausage.Mejadra (lentil + hung yogurt + fried shallot): Again, this is something I've been eating my entire life and I have to say, unfortunately, that this dish just didn't measure up. Despite the aforementioned dollop of yogurt, the rice is just dry as heck. It's been cooked in a skillet, which allows the side and bottom rice to get crispy - an idea which sounds great in theory but doesn't really work here. Far more problematic is the fried shallot on top. Traditionally, the shallots (or onions) are taken beyond the point of caramelization, which lends the dish a rich flavor that's unfortunately completely absent here. This was definitely the biggest disappointment for me.Seared Cauliflower (duck fat + tahini sauce + sesame + coriander): This is a very tasty side that's almost workmanlike in its execution. It's well done but it's nothing special, sadly.Turkish Manti Dumplings (smokey eggplant + yogurt sauce + molasses): This incredibly rich dish admittedly goes well with the Mejadra, as it cuts that dryness I mentioned. But it might be just a little too rich; between the heavy yogurt sauce and the sweet molasses, it's impossible to taste the smokey eggplant supposedly contained within the dumplings.All in all, I quite enjoyed my meal at Byblos. The ambiance is inviting, the service is flawless, and the food is, for the most part, quite above average. And I'd sure as heck go back just to eat that Duck Kibbeh again.

I know other restaurants have policies such as they cannot seat you until at least half of your party is here especially for parties of 6+. Or they may choose to enforce only during busy times such as night time and weekends. But to not seat me when the restaurant is obviously not full and not going to be any time soon and I'm only a party of two is I think a bit ridiculous.

I didn't feel good about this experience. They also brought our bill before we even asked for it, they wanted us to leave right after we finished our food even though no one was waiting for our table.

Was very eager to try this place out since I heard it open in Toronto. Came very hungry and very excited about the aburi (torched) sushi.Started off with the coal harbour seafood platter. Came with a selection of mussels, clams, two different type of raw oyster, one tiger prawn and scallops on an olive oil. SKIP THIS OPTION. Nothing too special about it. Everything was steamed and no real taste. Just your average seafood platter. Next, we ordered a variety of sashimi. The sashimi comes in orders of 6 pieces, which you can get half orders of. The sashimi was very fresh. They brought it all out on a huge platter and it all looked very carefully platted. My favourite was the uni and the big shrimp. The salmon was very lean, which I'm not a fan of (I like seeing white stripes on my salmon). They ran out of o toro by the time we were there :(We also ordered the calamari, which was very tote worthy! Worth ordering if you're a calamari lover like most of the people I was dining with.We ended up ordering all three types of aburi oshi sushi, salmon, mackerel and shrimp. This is the torched press sushi. I was a bit disappointed with the rolls. The rice is very sweet and soft. I would say my favourite was the shrimp one. Maybe it's because they have lean salmon and so when they blow torch the salmon, it doesn't release as much oil... But either way, I was a bit let down by these rolls.However, the Miku roll in itself was very tasty. I would say this was the highlight of the dinner. We ordered a half order but I wish we had gotten more. THIS IS A MUST ORDER!Along with the sushi, we also ordered the prime rib and baked lobster. I didn't get to try the prime rib because I was too full but heard it was good. The lobster was baked in a lemon Cajun mix and was pretty spicy!!! The restaurant is located inside the Waterpark building. Parking is available downstairs for $15. The restaurant is very modern and has very beautiful decor. Definitely a good place to impress a date or have a birthday dinner. The price and ambience wouldn't call for a go-to sushi place. IMO, really enjoyed my experience at Miku.

My only two main issues were the lack-lustre service and the small food portion. Their food would probably rate a 4, if not for the meagre portions. El Catrin, as a new restaurant in the area, has a lot of potential to develop into a trendy hangout - that's definitely what they're going for. My friends and I came here on Saturday at about 5 p.m. as we were looking for somewhere to catch up and I have just moved in the area. It was really chilly, but the patio is heated, and the ambiance was very upbeat and casual. The servers and hosts were wearing full face paint, which was definitely interesting and makes the experience distinguishable from other tapas restaurants, though they only do this every third Saturday of the month. However, shout outs to our server Evan G. for providing truly memorable inattentive service. I ordered the raw beef on crispy tortilla, which had great, elevated presentation, and a generous helping of the meat. My only suggestion would be the tortilla chips seemed really delicate and it was a very messy eat. I would have preferred the chips to be more stable/sturdy. I also ordered their house sangria, which tasted good, but I was expecting more fruit. We also ordered the Costilla Corta off of the sharing section of their menu, and then kind of just stared out in confusion at the small slab of braised beef short rib in front of us. The meat was very tender and well seasoned and the presentation and plating was impressive, but the portion was really small to be part of their sharing menu. We had another server bring out three different sauces and explained what each one was. We sat there confused looking on at the other tables with chips wondering if those were complimentary or if we had to specifically request them... or just spoon these sauces into our mouths... We eventually asked for the chips ourselves and 30 minutes after sampling our first plate, we were ready to order, but our server Evan was no where to be found. One of my friends mentioned we were looking for our server so we could order more. A host?/staff member said she would find Evan for us, and 15 minutes still no one. We eventually flagged down another server and ordered the grande grac (made with 2 avocados). A staff member made this in front of us, which guaranteed the freshness and was a nice touch. The guac tasted great and was a good spilt between three of us. Evan stopped by (maybe the paint fumes got to him?) and asked us how the guac was. My friends were full at this point, and I wanted to order more. Evan was making helpful recommendations, and I would likely have ordered their tacos and a few more drinks, but I decided to call it quits with the subpar service and frequent disappearing acts and head somewhere else. Anyway, the ambiance is spot on, and you'll likely have a good time.

I recommend it.- Rack of lamb - came with a deconstructed curry sauce.  I highly recommend it.  Best part for my husband was the fried banana, he enjoyed it so much that we asked for more for dessert, served with vanilla ice cream.- Caramelized black cod - generally good.  My husband enjoyed it.  However, I felt that although all elements were very good, I didn't enjoy the soft/mushy texture of the turnip cake against the cod.- Pork lion - we selected this off of the special menu of dishes Susur served on Top Chef Masters.  well prepared, but a bit boring after having the other dishes.  i would suggest sticking to the regular menu.We really enjoyed it and would recommend it.

They were not bad, but definitely nothing extraordinary. I didn't like the patatas braves con huevos fritos too much, was hard and bland in my opinion.

Now onto the food!One friend was very squeamish about all the nose-to-tail options available at the restaurant, so she asked for a recommendation for the safest option on the menu, which turned out to be potato & roe ($12). It was actually quite an ordinary potato soup, save for the addition of large salmon roes. I didn't actually think that the salmon roes added that much to the soup, but on the whole, it was tasty.The rest of us were more adventurous and ordered a bunch of dishes to share. The Black Hoof is most well-known for their charcuterie, so naturally, we had to order a platter of house cured meats ($29) to share. I honestly couldn't remember all the names of the meat, but I know that there was duck prosciutto and walnut studded salami. We also had a large order of bread ($4) to go with the charcuterie. I thought that the charcuterie was good, but everything tasted pretty similar and nothing really stood out.I've never tried horse meat before, so I was pretty excited for The Black Hoof's spicy horse tartare ($16). To my delight, it was quite delicious! To be perfectly honest, the horse meat just tasted like beef, but the texture was a good contrast against the crispy fried potato sticks. Everything together was quite rich (especially with that creamy sauce), so I recommend sharing this with a larger group.I also quite enjoyed smoked sweetbreads ($16). Eating an animal's thymus gland might sound disgusting, but it certainly tasted great! They reminded me of delicious and juicy chicken nuggets!I was extremely eager for tongue on brioche ($14) because I absolutely loved The Hoof Cafe's tongue grilled cheese. Sadly, this was not as good as the sandwich in my memory. We also wanted to try bone marrow here, but our server missed our order.

I was also glad to be having something soup-y considering the weather we'd had late last week. On the half-block walk from the car to Santouka, I stepped in a puddle so my feet froze while marinating in street sludge. Soup and noodles to the rescue!The place was tiny and while some people like to dawdle after their meals, I often feel rushed when I see hordes of people lined up at the door and try to eat and just get the eff out. I can't help it..and besides, ramen places aren't meant for people to sit around and kill hours on end.  I never tried Santouka when I was in Japan but I have had it in LA and theirs was DAMN GOOD. They also came in different sizes, whereas the location in Toronto offers only the one size which looked small when it arrived but was actually enough, probably because of the richness of the broth. We both ordered the basic miso ramen and gyoza and a couple of pops (sodas) which come in the old-school bottles--so cute! The ramen bowls are served in individual lacquer trays, which has nothing to do with anything, but I liked it anyway. The soup has that rich density that seems to accompany broths that have been boiling away forever, and you know it's got to be pretty fatty, but that's what makes it so guuuhhhhd~ There were two small pieces of chashu, a swirly odeng, green onion, black mushrooms (or was that seaweed?), and those pickled thingies (I forget what they're called). I didn't realize it doesn't come with the egg but just as well since I don't like it when the yolks are half-runny, even though that's how they're supposed to be. The noodles were springy which was a good sign. There's no question that this chain knows what they're doing. I didn't find anything too unique about the gyoza but I find that's usually the case, just that gyoza and ramen go hand in hand. Service is friendly and cheery, and things move along quickly enough. I noticed a wide age range of Japanese people eating at Santouka the night I was there, which is always a good sign. I had Kenzo at the original location last week and it's not what it used to be, from what I understand. Sadly, I don't really have high expectations of ramen in Toronto but am willing to keep trying the different places that seem to be popping up everywhere.

Grabbed a seat at the sushi bar because I felt guilty taking up a table as a solo diner.  Here are my impressions:  Positives:+ambiance-wise, definitely good for dates but can be a tad noisy.  I could barely hear the sushi chef behind the counter, even from sitting at the bar.  +service seemed very quick for a weekend night.  restaurant appeared to be half full.  Negatives:-Menu seemed diverse in that there were non-sushi items available, as well as the usual creative rolls.  However, all of the raw fish (sashimi) bowls were defined as chef's selection.  In my experience, you can get a bowl of raw tuna on rice just about anywhere.  Well, not here at Yuzu.  I asked a waiter what exactly was chef's selection.. he said it was whatever the chef decided.  (duh!)  Not helpful.-I happen to enjoy sea urchin.  It's an expensive delicacy and the menu listed sea urchin as $11 for sashimi or $9 for nigiri (on a slab of rice).  I ordered the nigiri option.  Well, this is where I encountered the Bait 'N Switch!  As I was waiting for the food to arrive, the sushi chef explained to me that the sea urchin is actually not $9.  Apparently the menu refers to an inferior version of sea urchin that is sourced from Vancouver... but coincidentally, they have a better version that is from Japan..  oh, and this better Japanese version costs double the price.  I asked the guy why this wasn't on the menu anywhere..  he said my waiter was supposed to let me know.  Bizarre!  Well, I was really in the mood for sea urchin, so I went with this ultra fancy Japanese version.  Spoiler #1: it was not that special.  Spoiler #2: the price was more than double -- $20.-Wakame salad (seaweed salad) was a joke. Literally the size of a kid's scoop of ice cream.Weirdness:? Ordering was a little bizarre.  as soon as I sat down, a young man came to take my order..  I was puzzled by the chef's selection part (see Negatives above), so I ordered the Wakame salad appetizer and said I'd figure the rest out later.  The guy leaves and then this woman shows up and asks to take my order..  I did not want to cause confusion, so I said, Oh, I already spoke with the other waiter.  She replied, You only ordered the seaweed salad.  How does she know this??  So I gave her the rest of my order.  ? Didn't get a refill on hot tea.  I took that as a sign to leave early.  Overpriced for what you get..  but the rolls weren't bad.  Sea urchin Bait 'N Switch was seriously disappointing.

Walking in, there are four small tables on the left with 2 seats each, though there are chairs at the side if more people come in. I do not recommend coming in here with a group of people, unless you guys come in a time when people are busy (e.g. at work, etc). The menu was easy to read with a few photos showing how each of them look like. Of course, we decided to try the green tea crepe cake - a famous item on their list. The crepe cake was very small. I'd say approximately 7cm for the largest section and maybe 15cm in length for $8.50. Each crepe layer was extremely thin enriched with a thin layer of cream in between each of the layers - it was oh so delicious. Soft and delicate with approximately 20 layers, the cake squishes together as you cut into to. It was definitely expensive, but because of the amount of work they put into it, I think it was worth it.Another item we tried was the Japanese special crepe. The crepe was wrapped very nicely stuffed with chocolate (that I couldn't really taste) and strawberries all in the inside and topped with green tea ice cream and whipping cream all wrapped up in a roll. The mixture of flavours together was DELICIOUS. I don't know how it would taste if i ate it as a wrap though (I unfolded everything when I ate it), because if I ate it as a wrap, I would have to eat the entire ice cream and whipped cream before I get to the strawberry galore.

Walking down Parliament street we totally missed this restaurant and had to back track to find it. It's actually located in the basement but there were street level signs.Stepping inside it was very under whelming. Without all these positive yelp reviews and my desire to indulge in there famous jerk chicken I may have just turned around and left. The restaurant is really dated with old school wood panelled walls, tiny rickety cafeteria tables, and matching wood panelled banquets with saggy pinstriped cushions.Before I had chance to consult with my hubby of our intentions of staying or leaving our lovely waitress Kim warmly welcomed us and told us to grab a seat anywhere. It was just past 4pm and the restaurant although tiny had about 8 other guests dining. We took a seat against the banquet beside the bar at a corner table. I have to admit the seats were a bit uncomfortable as the wood panelled banquets were awkwardly angled at least they had some sort of cushion and the small table seemed to be at awkward height as well but nothing I couldn't manage. Kim came back and delivered us the menus, informed us of the specials, and brought us a pitcher of ice water with sliced cucumbers inside which was a nice touch. They also have daily specials that change all the time but we both knew what we wanted the jerk chicken dinners. We asked to sub the jasmine rice that it comes with for peas and rice and Kim said no problem. I thought there would be an extra cost to do that but surprisingly there wasn't. Kim asked if we like our jerk chicken spicy or mild and we both wanted spicy. She also explained that they grill the chicken made to order so it may take a while. We were both cool with that as hearing our food was not precooked and being made fresh for us was another bonus.Kim was really nice and chatted with us and keep us posted on the status of meals. What was also nice to see was as guests came in you could see that they were all regulars as she greeted them by name and had there drink orders memorized.When our meal finally arrived I was in heaven. After that first bite of chicken I knew why there were soo many regulars and why it was so raved about. Seriously some the best jerk chicken i've ever had! The chicken itself was soo juicy and tender, seasoning was perfect, nice grill flavour, and the heat was good without being too much. What I also loved about this chicken was it was all boneless chicken, mostly thigh meat, and not saucy so you get that nice dry jerk seasoning through the moist tender meat. The meal also came served with a garden salad and homemade coleslaw. Normally I hate coleslaw but this one was pretty good, not too creamy and it had a nice tangy sweet and sour flavour. The peas and rice were also really good and the hidden gem in this dish was the bit of oxtail gravy over the rice and a little piece of oxtail with bone. The oxtail was also amazing, so tender and flavourful you could tell they really stewed it well. It was such a nice surprise to find it under the chicken but such a tease because it was soo good it made me want more.At the end of our meal we were highly satisfied. The portion was ample with lots meat and we definitely fulfilled our jerk chicken craving. This restaurant is also really affordable I think our meal was $11 each which I thought was a total steal! Fresh, flavourful food and a waitress that's soo warm and welcoming you can totally see why so many people keep coming back here. I will definitely be returning to get my jerk chicken fix and to try the oxtail dinner! ANSWERNOTFOUND",The portion was ample,"(3266, 3287)",2,0.0,False

I was not a big fan of their famous Khao Soi or pad tai ( I mean they are still good but not mind blowing like what others said ) but I quite enjoyed everything else. Their green curry is not mind blowing as well but still have all the flavours that you look for when it comes to Thai curry My usual go to is pad gra prow with crispy pork. It's a fried rice dish with your choice of meat that's cooked with Thai basil serve with sunny side egg, cucumber and fish sauce. This dish has everything. There is tenderness of meat and crispness and juicy fat from crispy pork. Fish sauce brings all the flavours out and creamy runny egg York wraps all the flavours together. When you feel like it's little too much of fat, there is silky rice and crispy cucumber to balances out the dish. Perfect dish I'll like to have when I have a little cheat day.Chiang Mai Beef Noodle Soup is another favorite of mine. Braised beef is so tender it just falls apart in your mouth. There is good balance between creaminess of peanut butter, spice, sweetness and sourness of lime. It was little bit on the heavier side than other Chiang Mai beef noodle soup I tried. Still darn good. If you are not into heavy dishes, just go for beef salad or papaya salad. They are very refreshing but yet has lots of flavour and quite filling. I took one star off because up and down of service. It's 50% chance hostess and servers will be very rude and forgetful and 50% chance they will provide the acceptional service.

The beef carpaccio itself was amazing, it melted in my mouth and was packed with flavour! We then had the Kaisan Soba, which was basically a seafood soba. You can choose to get it mild or spicy. I got it spicy, which I thought was a very nice kick, I didn't find it too spicy. I was surprised with the generous amount of seafood that came with the soba. There were clams, mussles, prawns, scallop and squid. The seafood were all huge, and super fresh. The soba had a very nice texture to it, definitely one of the best soba I've had. Keep in mind this isn't your traditional soba dish though, it seemed a bit more stir fried. Anyways, overall it was super yummy!Miku is known for their Oshi Sushi (aka the blow torch pressed sushi), so I definitely had to try that. I had the salmon and mackerel. Both were amazing!

My husband really liked that touch, I personally took it off before eating the sushi. We also ordered the Miku roll, which was to die for. This roll literally melts in your mouth. What I loved the most about it is that there was such a thin layer of rice around the roll, with each bit, I mostly just tasted the salmon and uni and tobiko, which was awesome!!!

It is very clear you will have a fun time here.Of course, good decor means little if the food is not up to snuff. Me and my dining companions had a tasting of various dishes. We were started off with some guacamole and chips, with the avocado smashed at table side. It came with a variety of sauces from mild to hot, and also some crickets in a mild chili oil. The guac was very fresh and tasty, and it was neat to try the crickets which are very rich in protein.The Atun Ahi tuna ceviche - with watermelon, Yucateco mignonette, lime and chives, was light and refreshing. It went well with some chips as well and got the appeitite going.The Esquites were surprisingly good - made with charred corn off the cob, epazote, chiptole aioli and lime. Even though it's in a shot glass, it is a warm dish, and the flavour of the freshly grilled corn with the aioli was amazing! I would say this is a must-get.Sopes de Tinga - pulled chicken chipotle with tomato stew, black bean puree, lettuce, crema fresca, queso cotija on corn flour masa. This was delicious as well and well worth trying.Pescado Nayarit - Grilled beeline snapper that is marinated in chile ancho, served whole and de-boned. Came with corn tortila, avocado and salsa martajada. A great dish if you feel like having some fish tacos.Pollo Almendrado - Chicken supreme in almond sauce, fried plantains, chayote squash, sauteed zucchini. This was my favorite dish of the night. The chicken was prepared perfectly and was moist and tender. It had a nice crispiy skin, and the almond sauce was really delicious with it. Everybody at the table loved it and I would put this on the must-get list as well.For dessert, we had some churros - they were pretty large, and yet very light and airy which are perfect. Easily the best churros I have ever had. We also had the Xocolatl (Mexican mousse, candied confir papaya and almond brittle). Surprisingly the Xocolatl was our least favorite item of the evening, as we were expecting something sweet at the end but it was not that sweet at all.Throughout the night we also had various drinks and they were all quite delicous. We split a pitcher of their margheritas and all drinks were made strong and definitely worth getting.Even though some reviewers have noted that this place is pricey, I really don't think it is considering the location and the environment. I thought items such as the tacos and the chicken mole were pretty on par with most restaurants that are not located in touristy areas.Overall, we enjoyed our night at El Catrin immensely.

My friend was busy talking and one rudely interrupted Excuse Me to ask if she wanted the meat. 4. While cutting the meat, the piece fell on the table but he didn't say anything, leaving my friend to reluctantly pick it up from the table. When she asked for another piece, he shaved off a tiny, thin piece and quickly left the table. 5. My friend asked for ribs and the server said she would check. When my other friend checked up on the order, she said I know, he already asked me. We were then told it would take 15 mins to make, which ended up to be more like 30 mins.

My sandwich came up to $6.77, which was very reasonable for what I got.

It was a little fatty, but this is to be expected from pork belly- The meat was of good quality; leaps and bounds better than the mystery meat of the classic $2 Banh Mi. - The vegetables were also very fresh, and I enjoyed how there was a pickle in the sandwich which I have never had before- The hot sauce was great as always (I'm a big fan of this sweet hot sauce in Banh Mi sandwiches)- I asked for spicy, and the hot sauce was unevenly distributed with one half being medium and the other half being very hot.

I had the Karaage (fried chicken), Takoyaki (deep fried octopus), Gyu Tongue (angus beef tongue), and the Kakimayo (baked oyster with spinach, garlic mayonnaise, and cheese). The fried chicken had an excellent tenderness on the inside, and a decent crispiness on the outside. Takoyaki is really hot when served, so let it cool for a while. It had a great flavour from the sauce and a nice softness on the inside. The Gyu Tongue was chewy and flavourful and the bean sprouts were a nice garnish. The baked oyster was freshly baked, and had a slight thick and warm creaminess that made this dish one of the tastiest oyster dishes I had in Toronto so far. The drinks here are not bad. The Sake Mojito was fairly refreshing and the mint was not too strong. Service is not going to be great when there's so many people so this is a place to chill out and not be in a hurry. The washroom is kind of cool and surprisingly clean. The patio outside seems like a great place to hang out when the temperature is greater than 19 degrees Celsius outside. Overall, if you are looking to get a tiny flavour of the Toronto nightlife with your really cool companions and buddies with some tasty food and decent drinks, this place may be a pretty good choice. Just be prepared for some loud noise, and prepare yourself to talk louder. I had a great time here, and I think if I come back to this place again with a lot of really cool companions and a few good buddies, I think it will be the beginning of some memorable evenings in Toronto.

Their prices are quite steep but what can you except from a restaurant in this area? The ambiance is very hip and modern with sofa seats that are arranged so that all friends and family can sit comfortably however close you want to. No need to fumble around with heavy chairs and worry about your purse falling to the ground.Customer service was impeccable - the waiters were very knowledgeable of the ingredients as well as the cooking process of each dish. The dishes just seemed that much more special when you got a spiel on all the work that went into it.I went with my boyfriend for our anniversary dinner and we ordered the lamb ribs ($14), turkish manti dumplings ($14), sweet jeweled basmati rice ($19), yogurt baked fluke ($27), finished with the burnt honey and turkish coffee ice cream ($3/each). The lamb ribs appetizer comes with two ribs, making it a small, unfilling dish but it tasted amazing! I would recommend it for anyone making a visit. It was very soft and the meat just fell off the bone. The turkish dumplings were covered in this unique sweet sauce that took me a few bites to get accustomed to. My initial reaction was that it seemed a bit weird, but as I continued eating it, I couldn't stop. It was a nice sweet dish to have that contrasted well with the other food. The jeweled basmati rice was an exciting dish that tasted as unique as it looked. There was a crunch to the rice and tasted faintly of orange blossom (not something I get to taste everyday). I would have to say that the fluke was the least exciting of them all. It wasn't cheap but the flavours weren't anything special. Plus, it was a bit smaller than what I expected. Both the ice creams were amazing in my opinion. Some reviews below said they liked the coffee ice cream more, but I couldn't get enough of the burnt honey ice cream! The coffee ice cream had a bold, intense flavour, perfect for black coffee lovers.I would love to go back but until I make more money, I will just have to constantly relive the moment in my head!

But the fact that this place is packed on a Monday night speaks volumes. Aside from the expansive and cosy patio they have here, the interior of the restaurant is simply gorgeous - Giant tequila/liquor wall at the bar area, colorful decor, edgy wall art, rustic wood tables, to the Mexican wrestling mask in black lighting - all give a very fun and energetic vibe. It is very clear you will have a fun time here.Of course, good decor means little if the food is not up to snuff. Me and my dining companions had a tasting of various dishes. We were started off with some guacamole and chips, with the avocado smashed at table side. It came with a variety of sauces from mild to hot, and also some crickets in a mild chili oil. The guac was very fresh and tasty, and it was neat to try the crickets which are very rich in protein.The Atun Ahi tuna ceviche - with watermelon, Yucateco mignonette, lime and chives, was light and refreshing. It went well with some chips as well and got the appeitite going.The Esquites were surprisingly good - made with charred corn off the cob, epazote, chiptole aioli and lime. Even though it's in a shot glass, it is a warm dish, and the flavour of the freshly grilled corn with the aioli was amazing! I would say this is a must-get.Sopes de Tinga - pulled chicken chipotle with tomato stew, black bean puree, lettuce, crema fresca, queso cotija on corn flour masa. This was delicious as well and well worth trying.Pescado Nayarit - Grilled beeline snapper that is marinated in chile ancho, served whole and de-boned. Came with corn tortila, avocado and salsa martajada. A great dish if you feel like having some fish tacos.Pollo Almendrado - Chicken supreme in almond sauce, fried plantains, chayote squash, sauteed zucchini. This was my favorite dish of the night. The chicken was prepared perfectly and was moist and tender. It had a nice crispiy skin, and the almond sauce was really delicious with it. Everybody at the table loved it and I would put this on the must-get list as well.For dessert, we had some churros - they were pretty large, and yet very light and airy which are perfect. Easily the best churros I have ever had. We also had the Xocolatl (Mexican mousse, candied confir papaya and almond brittle). Surprisingly the Xocolatl was our least favorite item of the evening, as we were expecting something sweet at the end but it was not that sweet at all.Throughout the night we also had various drinks and they were all quite delicous. We split a pitcher of their margheritas and all drinks were made strong and definitely worth getting.Even though some reviewers have noted that this place is pricey, I really don't think it is considering the location and the environment. I thought items such as the tacos and the chicken mole were pretty on par with most restaurants that are not located in touristy areas.Overall, we enjoyed our night at El Catrin immensely.

The only flaws I noticed was that the red sauce was too sweet for my liking and mozzarella cheese was a bit bland (had little flavour or stretch that i expect with pizza cheese) and they were skimpy on it.  In terms of chain pizzas, I rank them ahead of most with maybe Pizzaollo and Pizza Nova ahead of them.  The cost for a 11 pie with 3 toppings was $13.15 tax incl.  I can get a 12 pie from Bitondos or Pizza Gigi for roughly $14 and they taste a whole lot better. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(914, 928)",5,0.0,False

It's got a great location: right on the water in the heart of the Entertainment District. There is no parking (which is to be expected in an area like this) so we paid $30 at a public lot, and that $30 allowed us to stay until 7am the next morning - not bad! Anyway, the atmosphere inside this place is really funky, yet comforting. It doesn't feel generic at all. They have an awesome light fixture dominating the whole place, and a really tall, pretty bar setup. What made this experience so great for us was our server, Max. He was so, so friendly and really knowledgeable and passionate about the different beers they offered too. You could tell he truly knew the answers to the questions we asked and gave us his honest opinion about his favorites. Oh, and I LOVE that they offer wine and mixed drinks in addition to just beers. Perfect for someone like me, who enjoys the atmosphere of breweries, but not the beers so much ;) The prices definitely aren't cheap, but they're not horrible either. For that reason though, we decided that we'd each choose an appetizer as our meal. I went with the poutine which was very, very good, and also like a regular portion size, so, win-win. My boyfriend choose the buffalo cauliflower bites which were also really good, and a lot better than either of us expected. The flourless chocolate torte was our dessert of choice (it was my birthday, after all) and it was definitely very dense. Nothing wrong with it, just not my personal preference.

What a way to end the trip! Everything here--the food, the service, and the presentation--was top notch. While we perused the food menu, I ordered the raspberry mojito martini (El Dorado 12-Year rum, fresh raspberries, prosecco, chambord raspberry liqueur, fresh lime, and mint), which was sweet, delicious, and strong. We had a hard time deciding what to order because everything on the menu looked amazing, but we ultimately went with Susur's signature Singaporean style slaw to start, which our server highly recommended (for good reason) followed by cheeseburger spring rolls (smoked chili mayo, pickled veg, lettuce wrap) and a special Ocean to Table platter, which I'll describe below. The slaw came in a beautiful mountain, which they mixed at our table. Once they served it, they removed the remainder to replate before returning it to us. At first, it seemed like the size of the dish was enormous, but it's so tasty and light that we made short work of it--so many great flavors and textures. My boyfriend was the one who ordered the spring rolls, which he said were amazing (I didn't try them for fear of being too full). The seafood platter was basically a sampler that included the following:--*Nova Scotia snow crab meat with avocado, sherry emulsion, fresh dill--Freshly shucked Colville Bay oysters wth sea buckthorne and Asian citrus gelee--PEI smoked slamon with yuzu and marjoram babaganoush, creme fraiche, wild acadian sturgeon caviar on squid ink crostini. --*Fresh scallop ceviche with salted plum and charred jalapeno vinaigrette--*Lobster Thailandaise with green mango and papaya salad, double smoked crispy bacon, cashews, chili and lime, Myogoa ginger flower--Shrimp cocktail with homemade assam horseradish cocktail sauceThe ones I marked with asterisks were my favorites, but all of the items were good. The only false note was the shrimp, which seemed overcooked to the point of being mushy. For dessert, we got the vanilla bean creme brulee (lemongrass, strawberry & gooseberry compote, butterfly pastry) and the signature French and Chinese tong yuen (warm sweet rice dumpling, chocolate nougat, Indian pastry, strawberry, crème brûlée, peach, and rosewater). Both were delicious, but two desserts was probably a little too much.The servers were attentive without being intrusive, they explained every dish as they served it, and they cleaned the table in between each course. Our main server even gave us recommendations about where to find live music after dinner.Not sure I'll ever be in Toronto again, but if I am, I would certainly return here for another memorable meal.

I reviewed the Levetto website carefully, and I couldn't find any information about whether they took reservations or not - many restaurants will note that you can't make reservations or they tell you what you need to do to make a reservation. So what I did was send Aly MacGregor an email (she is in charge or press and media inquiries) and she arranged a reservation for myself and my friends. Aly not only addressed all my questions, and reservation changes (a very patient lady she is), she made sure to follow-up on our experience the day after our reservation. One highlight of my communication with Aly was when I asked about gluten-free options for my friend Karen who really wanted to join us for dinner (Levetto does not have gluten-free options on their menu), and she spoke to Chef Shahir Massoud (Corporate Executive Chef for Levetto) about my query, and Levetto agreed to look into this for us.The day before our reservation, I received a Twitter message that read, Look Itanni! Gluten-free pasta! And there was an image of Chef Shahir making fresh gluten-free pasta. How incredible is that?!  So I immediately contacted Karen, and she was thrilled for the opportunity to join us and not have to stick to salads.On the evening of our reservation I strolled in ON TIME, and as usual my guests were already there, seated. Argh Once I greeted everyone I went to look for Chef Shahir to thank him for what he had done for Karen.  I was relieved to see that Chef Shahir was there this evening (they had recently opened the College location, so it was very likely that he would be at the College location). When I introduced myself and thanked him for the reservation and the gluten-free pasta, he flipped it around and said, no THANK YOU! We are so excited to have you and your friends join us. I wanted to be here to meet you all. Aly really wanted to come as well but there was a scheduling conflict. Awww! It often shocks me when a restaurant that is doing so well, can be so humble. But then it is because of restaurants and service like the one we received at Levetto that will keep from returning to a restaurant that has amazing food, and a self-righteous attitude.The MenuThe menu is split into 5 sections:Pasta ($8-$13)Pizza - they come in three sizes: personal (4 pieces), medium (6 pieces), large (guessing 8 pieces) and the prices range from $6.50-$31Salad ($8-$9)SpecialsDesserts ($6)Every single one of my guests were blown away by the food. It was not only delicious, but the ingredients were fresh, the pasta was made from scratch, great portions, and there was definitely value for money. We also lucked out in the dessert department. If you check-in to Yelp, you get a free dessert, so we all got a different dessert so we could share and try all three. My personal favorite was the Tiramisu, followed closely by the Warm Brown Butter & Coconut Semolina Cake that was served steaming hot, and then the Panna Cotta. But really, it comes down to your taste preference: if you like rich go with the cake, if you like creamy go with the tiramisu, if you like tart and not-so-sweet desserts, then go with the panna cotta.After dinner Chef Shahir made sure to check-in with every guest, and shared with us how he became a chef and some stories from his time in New York. I told him that I was flying to Italy the following week, and that when I returned I would teach him a thing or two about Italian food. ;)Thank you to the team at Levetto and Aly for making this wonderful evening happen for us. Since this dinner, almost all my friends have returned, and at least 4 are now regulars. Now I am dying to see how the College location is doing. I hope it's just as good as the Liberty Village location since the College location is closer to where I live.See you soon Levetto!xoP.S. Karen wanted me to tell you that Chef Shahir packed up the left over pasta for her to take home.

It's an eclectic combination of random themes and items that might be best described as fusion. Fused between what, you might ask. Well you've got an obvious Japanese connection (with the ramen, omurice, and takoyaki offerings). There is a random Korean connection with the bibimbap options. And then there is some typical Chinese stuff (be it HK or Taiwan); most of the desserts fit in this category. It is hard to pinpoint what exactly they were trying to accomplish here. The menu is really quite disconnected, even moreso than Toronto's transit system.As for actual food quality, it is hit or miss. According to my companions, the ramen is quite good, though expectedly not quite up to the same standard as any authentic ramen house. Their rendition of bibimbap I found extremely awkward. It comes in a small bowl overflowing with toppings, to the point that you're unable to stir up the sauce into the bowl. And the bowl is actually quite small compared to the bibimbap you would get at any Korean place. It also is not as satisfying when it comes to flavour (beware that the sauce they give you is some other random sauce and not the standard gochujang). The teppanyaki rice seems interesting, but at the end of the day it's basically more or less a bulgogi (or something similar) served with rice ON the hot plate itself. Cute attempt at trying to be creative, but it's only about as creative as a Justin Bieber song.Desserts are interesting and good for some photos so that you can generate some social media envy. But at the end of the day, it's nothing special compared to your average Taiwanese or HK dessert house.Service was hectic on a Saturday night and we found it difficult to track down servers. They got the job done but there is nothing in particular to commend. Place gets busy on weekends - arrive later than 7 and you might find yourself having to wait a little while for a table.

The squash fritters were piled high - nicely battered and crunchy but the dip is what makes this dish. Magic. Wish they had a half size option as this dish is massive and way too much for two people to share.- Chef Nuit pad thai ($15.00) - stir fried rice noodle in a homemade tamarind sauce with bean sprouts, tofu, egg, chives, Thai coriander, fresh lime and home roasted peanuts. Noodles had a nice chewy texture to them and the tamarind sauce was perfect. Not too sweet, tangy. This was pretty legit.- Gaeng hunglay ox tail ($15.00) - sweet and sour ox tail ginger curry. Served with steamed jasmine rice. Ox tail is always good in my books but I don't think I've ever had it Thai style. The curry was rich and heavy but the ginger helped cut down the richness somewhat.

I also wish the menu included some of the items in the pictures that other reviewers had because the night we went, there wasn't anything overly mind-blowing to choose from, though everything we had was good--just not spectacular which was what I expected as Buca has always been highly recommended.  We originally planned to go to Terroni as I was craving one of their pizzas which kind of comes close to the pizza of all pizzas I had in Milan, but their lineup was too long and I was DAMN hungry so we headed for Buca where we were able to snatch up a table right away. If you've never been, it's on King--next door to Cheval--they're separated by a laneway that leads to Buca's doors. Go through the doors and down the stairs to discover a beautiful space with exposed brick walls (I know, cliche~), and two dining rooms (one is more a wine cellar), dim lighting...romantic if you want it to be. We ordered:- the nodini were OK; they're adorable little nubs of bread doused in oil & garlic, but I probably won't bother ordering them next time- lamb skewers - I let my friend go to town on those and he was practically squealing with delight between bites whereas I am not a lamb fan, though I wish I were!- breaded, fried eggplant layered with fresh basil leaves, parm & ricotta and a squirt of burrata on top - judging from the description, I was kind of expecting something similar to eggplant parmaggiano (minus the tomato sauce) which is one of my favourite dishes but instead it was very bland; not a single ingredient besides the basil offered any flavour  - salsiccia pizza - very good pizza, served on a long cutting board and as everyone else mentioned: scissors for your convenience, which I've only ever seen in Korean restaurants...I was torn between the veal tenderloin and the sea bass, when my eye caught their list of pizzas and their scamorza seemed to be a close fit to the pizza I would have had at Terroni so I went with that. While I enjoyed every bite of it, instead of us ordering two pizzas, I should have had one of the other mains so as to get a real taste of chef Gentile's range of talent (I'm sure he's wonderful). You know what this means...I'll have to go back.- Buca's got this crazy-extensive tome of wines so if you're a wine-lover, I am sure you'll be pleased.  - (Wait, I'm not done!) We shared the dessert of 3 big balls of gelato of your choosing. Ours included lavender (my friend nearly threw up when he tasted it; I guess it's not for everyone), hazelnut (TONS of nuts throughout, like I've never seen--which I loved), and blood orange (SO GOOD), all sprinkled with toasted spices. I am guessing they make their own gelato, which was clearly the most popular dessert.Along with your bill, you get the cutest little packet containing a tiny nougat-ball with their card attached. I love it when restaurants go the extra mile with such small details! Service was excellent--I always get a kick out of places that insist on reciting your order back to you as each dish is presented at your table, though I'm not sure all the waiters were Italian as many suggest. Whatever the case, I found most of their service to have a real old-school polished-ness about it which is not terribly common, so that was nice. Considering this was an unplanned, passing-by situation on a Sunday night, the meal was a bit of a splurge, though not totally insane. Buca is definitely on the pricey side but prime location, excellent service, and chef Gentile all come at a price, though I will definitely go back to Buca as I am curious to try their other dishes which I am sure are amazing.

It was a weekend and it was lunchtime so the tables were available but still crowded. After sitting down at the bar I immediately liked the atmosphere. It was well-lit, simple and in motion.

A sweeter yellow curry withe the most tenderous beef chunks. A thick curry sauce that was perfect for smothering the aged jasmine rice they use here. Apparently the aging gives off a continuous and individual fragrance while in curry. The combination was absolutely ridiculous. My gf received the green curry with chicken and bamboo shoots. A much lighter and thin curry that complimented the rice included very well. My gf especially liked the kafir lime leaves and basil, it made the dish for her.You may be wondering, why I mentioned that she ordered panang curry and then reviewed the green curry. Well, there was a slight mix up in the kitchen, she got the wrong dish. As soon as we had let them know, one of the co-owners was soon beside us to apologize. What a great guy! He offered to pack the first dish up for us and bring out the right dish for free.This guy knows how to service his customers. With such a minor mistake, he made great steps and effort to make it right. I really appreciated that. After we got our third dish, all of the servers were especially kind and accommodating.What did we think of the panang? It was of course also delicious. With the basil and lime leaves again, my gf really liked it. It was a drier curry compared to the green curry which was thinner and soupy.

I loved the soup, it came out over a candle to keep it hot, served with a side of rice. It came with two jumbo shrimp and some onions and mushrooms. You can definitely taste the fish sauce, which I love in Asian cuisines. It was definitely a cozy and super tasty dish. However, I was very disappointed in the service we received from our waitress, and am very displeased to say that the kitchen staff who brought out our food was far more helpful than our actual waitress. We were seated and were waiting for one friend, but we knew what they wanted, so we waited for our waitress to come around to at least order our drinks, but she didnt for 15 mins and we had to flag her down, which she did not seem happy about. My boyfriend had asked her what was on tap, and she rudely replied with What? along with a displeased look. After ordering our drinks, she went off when we wanted to order our food as well, so we gave her a few minutes to punch in orders, tend other tables. We ended up waiting another 10 minutes and had to flag her down again, still seemed unhappy with asking her to take our order. When my friend had noted that he had a peanut allergy and asked if there was any nuts in his dishes, she once again seemed displeased to be asked a question. It took about 20 minutes to receive our food, and some of it was cold, where as the table behind us who had sat down and order after us began receiving their food within 5 minutes of ordering. Not even once during our meal did she ask if our meal was okay or if we wanted more water, we actually had to ask a different staff member to help us out. Another thing I kind of found work inappropriate was what one of the servers was wearing (btw I am in no way shaming this server or have any problems with what she was wearing but in no way do I or many others find it workplace appropriate in a restaurant for families...) but she was wearing a VERY sheer top, without anything under and you could clearly see her nipples, mind you I'm ok with that, but I'm not so sure families with younger children would be okay with that. In the end, we received our bill from our waitress, who yet once again seemed so annoyed with us, we saw that we had a 20% service charge. I'm okay with paying a service charge, since we did have 6 people, but I don't really think that our server deserved the 20% since her coworkers were waiting our table for her. Overall, the food is pretty good, a little bit on the pricier side for the portion you receive but the quality is there, but I don't mind as there aren't many good Thai restaurants in Toronto. i loved the atmosphere and vibe they had going on.

But I will be nice since it's fairly new. So.  I was really prepared to love this resto.. I remember seeing raving reviews from a few foodie friends that went and getting hyped about trying the items on their menu.  However, I was ill-prepared in doing my homework for which dishes to order, which led to a couple bad choices on our part.Small Plates-TABLE SIDE WELLINGTON COUNTY BEEF TARTARI mean.. I like it, I just don't love it.  It had a tangy kick similar to the horse tartar I had at Black Hoof, but the seasoning wasn't all there and while I enjoyed the first few bites, I kind of got bored half way through.  The bread it came with complemented the dish well, but.. it was alright.  -FRENCH ONION SOUPI didn't pick this one; but we both thought this was a bit too salty... Duncan House's French onion soup blew this one out of the waters and I honestly couldn't have any more after two spoonfuls.  Too much salt, the cheese couldn't even be the saving grace.. nor could the lovely bread.  Large PlatesHUNTER'S STEW - Rabbit, pheasant sausage, beef cheek, whole mustard sauceGod I loved the pheasant sausage.  I thought it would taste like chicken.. but nope.  It The mustard sauce complimented the protein so perfectly, and while I wasn't a huge fan of the veggie medley in the stew, the sausage made the dish for me.  Rabbit meat also had a more distinctive taste than the last time I had it at Luma.Recommended!DRUNKEN TUNA - Seared ahi, red pepper pesto, pomme purée, rocket salad, sherry vinaigretteThe tuna was done medium rare - on the rarer side.  I thought it was really flavourful but the birthday boy I came with thought it was a little salty.  To each their own but this was recommended to us by the waiter and I really liked the red pepper pesto on the side as well when I dipped the tuna in it :)  YUM.DessertMACARON ICE CREAM SANDWICHESHonestly just ordered this one so I could have a birthday message for the birthday boy.  It was really nice that when I included my request in my reservation in Open Table, they remembered and spelt on a message with chocolate & added a candle and everything!  I hear they give complimentary desserts to birthday guests anyway.  The dessert itself.. well, I had better macarons for sure.  The ice cream and sorbet were delish (raspberry sorbet, bailey's ice cream, and vanilla) - but the macarons were a little disappointing.Overall, the ambiance was fantastic and makes the resto very fit for a special occasion.  Especially around the holiday times when the Christmas Market is going on and everything in the distillery is absolutely beautiful.

I'm not sure if this is available for normal visitors, but I loved dining from an elevated position that allowed us to people watch.We ordered the roasted rice cakes, pork buns, ginger scallion noodles, and they also presented us with a special dish - their twist in Korean bbq.The roasted rice cakes had an amazing texture. The crispness of the outside paired with the pillowy inside of the rice cakes made for an amazing appetizer. It was a little under seasoned though, and I almost found myself wishing that there was a dip for it on the side perhaps.The pork buns, as always, were simply amazing. This is hands-down the best item on their menu. I know people rave about it constantly, but if you need to choose something to order, try their buns!! My sister was wide-eyed when she had one and loved it.The ginger scallion noodles were tasty, but greasy. The noodle texture had a great elasticity and provide a good bite. The seasoning itself, on first bite, was amazing. However, I felt that it could use more ginger to provide more to the dish. After 2 or 3 bites, the oil starts coating your mouth, so the flavour of ginger would really help to reset your palate. There just wasn't enough ginger to help cut through the grease.The cold Korean bbq was beautifully presented, and in a fun DIY manner that it's known for. It was served with gochujang on the platter, a medium rare steak, and vibrant greens. The steak was beautifully cooked, but again, it could've used another punch of flavour. The steak wasn't seasoned well enough for that extra impact. I feel like this could've pushed it over the edge if it had slightly better seasoning.We also had drinks with our meal, the paper crane and a melon drink. Paper crane was a bit too alcoholic for my tastes, but the melon drink was a fantastic one. I'd also like to add that our service was AMAZING!

Overall, we do not think that it's something that we look for. In general, it's geared towards a younger crowd and tried to emphasize on fusion food yet haven't quite get there yet.We initially were amazed by their warm welcome, customer service is okay. It is a little tight to sit and most people must put their jackets to the clothes rack in the entrance which I feel a little uncomfortable about. We started off with a ginger sake and I found it refreshing and is a really new idea to distinguish itself from other Japanese restaurants. We order approx. 7 dishes, most of them are seafood related and was completely disappointed. If you pay attention close enough, you would notice all the sauces for the dishes are basically interchanging: wasabi, mayo, tonkatsu sauce. Our tongues feel kinda numb after 3 dishes since they all taste the same. While scrapping off the sauce and really getting into the taste of the actual seafood or sashimi themselves, there is little or no taste at all.In terms of the environment, it is just way to loud to even chat with my wife.Paid approx. $70-$80 for the two of us, and didn't quite fill our stomachs.I would recommend it for people who likes Japanese beer or Sake and enjoy dinning in a party-like environment.I would not recommend it for people looking for authentic Japanese food and feel full after a dinner.

Not your typical pad thai for sure. Generally I dont finish food from other restaurants but Pai was an exception. Every bite I took from the pad thai made me want to get another.

I've also tried the original Santouka in Vancouver and the Toronto location is consistent in quality and taste.  I've been back to Santouka multiple times.I suggest coming late or early on a weekday if you don't want to line up, although lately in the summer the lines have shrunk a little.  I'm going to attribute that to Ryerson students being off and a surge of other Ramen restaurants opening (Raijin is just up the street but not nearly half as good). My go-to is the spicy ramen, but the shio and shoyu have their own merits.  It's not too spicy and they give you a large class of water to cool you off if it is.  The noodles all come with pork slices and other assorted toppings  You can choose to upsize your noodles or toppings as well.  Tip: You can request for reduced lard and salt if you're looking to be more healthy (let's face it, this has about as much nutrition as mcdonalds).  Two great side orders are additional tender pork slices (they will literally melt in your mouth and are great for dipping into the soup) and the gyoza which is not cooked from frozen like some other restaurants.  Service is quick and friendly.  I'm positive all the wait staff and cooks are Japanese, which adds to the ambiance.  Servers take your orders on their phones and due to the busy-ness, will be quick to both serve you and clean your table when you're done eating.  Don't expect anything more than a 30-45 minute meal.This place gets 5 stars because it is simply the best tasting ramen in Toronto.

My family has agreed that outside of Italy, Libretto is the best we have ever had (and as a family of pizza-lovers, we have had pizza at many places). It is prepared in the traditional Napoletana-style, seen in the goodness that is the chewy, soft, blistery crusts. Service is friendly and fast as well. I've tried nearly every pizza on the menu (save sausage, anchovie, and salami) at one point or another, and they were consistent in their taste and quality. I am a bit of a traditionalist in the sense that I like a pizza with tomato sauce and melted cheese of some sort, rather than one grated on after the pizza has been cooked. The Nduja sausage and margherita are best for fans of that. The white mushroom pizza is delicious as well. Really, all the pizzas are good. There is something for everyone and the waiters are accomodating with omitting certain ingredients, if you prefer. Not only are the pizzas great, but the appetizer menu is well rounded and perfectly proportioned. The warm olives are a great start to any meal. As for desserts, you can't make many mistakes here. My favourite is the Sfingi. If you like warm, pillowy donuts (and who doesn't?) these are amazing. They've got a beautiful golden crust and when i went were topped with cinnamon sugar and had a nutella filling (it might've been drizzle, I don't quite remember).

We came in the evening before the sunset so we got to see Toronto during the day as well as its night line--like a two-in-one deal!

To start, the grand seafood platter was sort of disappointing as the lobster and clams were overcooked. I had the smoked mushroom and onion soup as my appetizer and it tasted pretty bland; I could not detect any smokiness flavour at all. My main dish was the cod fish and shrimp, which was alright, but I wish the overall dish was less soupy(?!) because it felt more like an appetizer than an entrée. As for dessert, I loved the lavender ice cream, the flavour was spot on! We also got a complementary dessert because of my parents' anniversary and the orange chocolate was delicious!

What makes a crème brûlée A CRÈME BRÛLÉE is the fact that I can crack the top with my spoon!! What they served me was just custard! I do not recommend ordering this dessert.

We were running late but they had us seated right away. First, we looked at the rather limited cocktail menu and apprehensively ordered some of those expensive cocktails. We were so glad that they turned out to be so good (got our money's worth). I think their bartender recently won some competition and he truly knows his craft. We ordered a bunch of food items from the menu (mostly appetizers). Unfortunately for us they all came out in a hurry which was a slight blemish on the part of our server. We requested that they send some dishes back to the kitchen since we were not ready to take it all in at the same time and they obliged. Our server was very well informed and also stopped by our table to inquire about the dish we were served. Our favorite bites of the night were the oyster po'boy sliders (why are they so tiny?) and the octopus. The octopus is a complex dish but I loved the combination of the harissa and salsa verde (perfect for my palate). The king crab rosti was nothing memorable and it left a sour after taste. Moreover, for 32 bucks I would consider it rather expensive for what it's worth. We also ordered a side of skinny fries (highly recommended even if you are on a diet :)) which we really enjoyed dipping in some herbacious aioli. For dessert we had the angel food cake with burnt marshmallow crust which was very light and fluffy. Overall, this place has an upscale yet casual vibe. It also has the right acoustics since we never really felt it was loud to distract our conversation. We left a decent tip since the service was so good.

Including myself with 4 other friends, we made a booking for Friday at 730pm.  As we walked in, we had people immediately greeting us, offering coat checks and quickly seated at our booth table.  First impression, decoration is very modern, upscale, bright and beautiful.  Our booth seats were very intimate and comfortable.After browsing through the menu, we ordered:Smoked Soy Grilled Octopus, Pan Seared Scallops, AAA Sterling Silver Prime Rib, all three Aburi Oshi Sushi (Salmon, Ebi, Saba), Miku Roll, Miku Signature Sushi Selection, Green Tea Opera and Fuji Apple Tatin.  We also ordered Gold Omachi and Nakano Ume Sake!Appetizers (good for 4 people per order):The Octopus from the Smoked Soy Grilled Octopus appetizer was grilled to perfection, the tentacles were very tender and easy to chew. The other ingredients blended in well with the octopus.  The Pan Seared Scallops on the other hand, although beautifully displayed and large, the taste lacks a little flavour.Entree (Good for 6 people):AAA Sterling Silver Prime Rib (10oz) was a lot larger than expected, it comes auto medium rare which was perfect for me.  Prime Rib was juicy and the sauce was great.  The side baked potatoes and mushrooms were also equally as impressive!  I highly recommend.Sushi:Out of all the three Aburi Oshi Sushi, I highly recommend the Saba and Salmon as both had great amount of oil from the blowtorching and the sauce pairing were tremendous!  I recommend eating the Salmon before the Saba as the latter has a much stronger flavour that will overshadow the salmon.Mike Roll was decent, but was not superbly impressive, still worth a try if you are feeling for rolls with Uni (Sea urchin) and don't actually taste it much.  In terms of the Nigiri we got from the Miku Signature Sushi Selection, I though the Nigiri was the weakest link in terms of their sushi lineup.  The fish was just normal as it didn't give me the wow moment compare to my first bite on the Abrui Oshi Sushi.Desserts:Out of the two we ordered, I preferred the Green Tea Opera more.  It comes with a VERY strong matcha (green tea) ice cream with match cake on the side.  Both were very delicious and 5 of us did fight for this dessert more than the Fuji Apple Tatin.Sake:Large selection of Sake, but they were EXPENSIVE and tasted good!  The Ume Sake was a little too fruity and sweet for me (plum sake) so I preferred the Gold Omachi more (suited for warm drinking sake style).  The Gold Omachi was VERY smooth and I really enjoyed it.Overall, I really enjoyed my dinner experience on Friday.  I would give this 4.5 if yelp allows, but since it can't and I have to pick between a 4 or 5, I had to give this restaurant a 4.  The 1 missing start is because this restaurant was a bit weak on the Nigiri sushi we had, and I think for a Japanese restaurant, Nigiri is and should be one of their better items on the menu.

While we were waiting, I had my eye on the kitchen and I noticed two bowls of pasta sitting there for quite some time and I was silently praying to myself, please don't be our food, please don't be our food, please don't be our food...It was our food.It was served almost 10 minutes after it had been prepared and the dish suffered because of it. The Bolognese sauce itself was pretty tasty, though it was way, way too salty. But the pasta, because the dish had been sitting out so long, had essentially all clumped together and become one big piece. This was especially evident towards the bottom of the bowl, where the pasta had become one oversized chunk of mush. Oh, and the dish wasn't even remotely hot, of course.I'm not sure I understand how it's considered acceptable to serve food that's been sitting out like that. Both dishes should have been scrapped and made over again. A seriously disappointing experience.

It comes with purple rice, and 1 egg to put in the soup. The tofu was soft and silky but the amount of meat is not a lot. The broth is flavourful tho. It was my first time trying the purple rice. It has great texture and I heard it's very healthy.They don't have many side dishes to eat while waiting for your order tho: kimchi, pickled turnip, soy bean, and bean sprouts.

Contrary to what a few other commenters have said, I actually found the portions to be generous. I had the creole shrimp and grit cake to start, and there were at least five huge shrimp on the plate. With an extra side, this could have been a meal in itself! For my entrée I had the pork chop with mashed potatoes and collard greens. The pork chop was HUGE and I found myself unable to finish it. (This is shocking because I have a talent for eating.) As something of a mashed potato fiend, I was a little disappointed with their offering but the collard greens were well-cooked and tasty. I ended the meal with the cheese plate with flatbreads and fruit. Though the cheese was delicious (and award-winning according to the menu!) I found myself wishing I had gotten a real dessert instead. I had a bite of each of the other desserts: the blueberry tartlet, and the cherry soup with chocolate mousse. I would highly recommend the cherry soup and mousse. It had some kind of crunchy bits on top that were so tasty! All in all, I enjoyed the experience.

No please and thank you's for anything. When she dropped the dim sum bamboo steaming bowl on the floor because she was in a rush I picked it up and handed it to her.

The meat was tender the fillings were excellent and the tortillas were a lovely cross between soft and crispy.- service, friendly, helpful and attentive. Despire beign slammed, we never waited too long for anything including re-ups on drinks and/or asking questionsWhat I didn't like:- Tacos, yes I know I said I liked them, and I definitely do, but unlike the Hacienda and Cantina locations, you're only allowed to order 3 of the same kind of tacos, where the other locations you can order singles. To get a fourth of the same kind will run you and extra $4.

The first thing you should know about lunch on a weekday: GO EARLY.  11:45 will probably get you a seat if you're a small group, but 11:35 is even better.  They don't seat you until your entire party is there.The second thing you should know is that I have never been disappointed by any of the food there.  The fresh rolls are just that: fresh, and bursting with flavour.  Each vegetable and herb adds their own crunch and flavour in harmony.  I don't know what that mystery meat is (the menu goes with the vague chicken sausage) but it's dang good, and the accompanying sauce is double dip worthy.Of the main dishes, I've had Pad Gra Prao, Panang Curry, and Street Style Pad Thai.  Such an amazing balance of saltiness, sweetness, and spiciness.  There's a lot of depth to each dish, and having had North Americanized curries and pad thai before, the difference is strikingly obvious.  Everything has been a winner so far.  The price is right, too.  The curry of the day is $8, about the same kind of price you'd find at the food court, but with vastly superior food.  So the food, in my experience, is pretty terrific.  The service is usually as good.  The servers are very friendly and attentive.  Service with a smile!  If you arrive earlier than 11:45 and don't dilly dally, you can usually get your order in before the massive lunch crush which is helpful if you want to leave in a more reasonable amount of time.  If you get caught with the crowd, there could a little bit of a wait for the food.I'd eat here all the time if I wasn't on a quest to try different things.

Case in point, Mill Street Brewery. This brewery is tucked away in the distillery district and comes with a full fledged bar, retail store and restaurant. And guess what street it's on? Mill Street is basically known for it's big 4 beers; the ones sold in the LCBO. These consist of the tankhouse ale, the stock ale, the Belgian wit, and the coffee porter. However, if you go into the actual bar you'll be greeted by a slew of new and seasonal beers that they only have there. These range from your fruit beers to your stouts to your bocks and Oktoberfests. The variety is mezmerizing and delightful. Be sure to wet your whistle with a sample if your not feeling too adventurous. I know I wasn't trying the imperial chocolate stout.  Can't decide?  Try a taster pack. It's basically a couple of the beers in little cups so you can try them all.  I won't go into all the different beers they have because honestly they may not be there the next time I'm back. I'll list my top 3. First we have the cobblestone stout. I've been around the city trying differen stouts and comparing but coming from drinking guinness all the time nothing really pairs up. The cobblestone stout does though. The beer is nitrogen infused so unless guinness wants to release their nitrogen widget patent you won't be seeing thus out of the bar anytime soon. Upon pourig the stout expect the magical cascading that you usually expect to wait for. The head on the stout afterwards isn't as thick as the guinness head, more like the head on a boddington's. The stout tastes rich with hints of walnuts and chocolate. Definitely my favourite. Next we have the stock ale. This beer is a lighter beer similar to a sleemens cream ale (kinda). The stock ale is refreshing and crisp with a nice balanced finish. This one's actually sold in the beer store so be sure to try it out. I actually just picked up two kegs for a party. Yes, we really like it. Narrowing it down to another is kinda hard but i'd have to go with the belgian wit. I'm also a fan of wit beers (wit, wheat, white). The wit is characterized with aromas of corriander and oranges, quite nice on a summer day. I actually was hooked on the wit at luminato one year (mill st is known for sponsoring a slew of events in toronto). The beer is served with a slice of orange to accentuate the flavours in the beer and in my opinion is the best part. After throwing the orange in to soak everthing up it turns into this kinder surprise magical treat at the end of your beer.  This beer is also sold in the beer stores and LCBO. I'd try and pour it out to drink it though cause it's fermented in the bottle and you want to give the bottom a whirl before drinking it. The bar/restaurant is actually very nice. Large and expansive with a view of the distilling tins. I've been to a bunch of gatherings here and with a call ahead it's great for large parties. I can't say very much about the food.  I didn't have it this time and don't remember it from the last timeI was here. Maybe another day.PS  Their imperial chocolate stout has chocolate from soma chocolates across the street in it.

Obviously, eating atop a giant tower in a revolving restaurant will inflate food and drink prices a bit.  There are two- and three-course meal options available and a la carte selections.  The meal options are a way better deal because you get similar (or the same) entree with additional food.  The three-course menu was $79CAD per person (about $60US per person).  Drinks were $5-$10US, so typical of a restaurant/bar.  Some of the cocktails were a bit pricier but also fancier so you get what you pay for.  I enjoyed my soup (yellow tomato and corn gazpacho) and baked ziti with wild mushrooms.  There weren't a ton of mushrooms in the entree, but the ziti and chili sauce were delicious.  My husband got the aged ribeye entree and really enjoyed it.  It was a little too rare (even though he ordered medium rare) so maybe make sure they cook it medium throughout and not just one section of the cut.  Since they served bread before the meal, I filled up on a bit too much of that (there was some waiting between app and entree) so I almost couldn't finish my dessert.  I had the sorbet which was delicious and my husband had ice cream and cookies, which he loved.  The homemade fig newton was yummo.   Obviously, the view is excellent.  It takes 72 minutes for the restaurant to make one full rotation and they seem to have dinner timed pretty well to coincide with that revolution.  We basically ended where we started (a little later) so we were only up there for like 90 minutes.  Even though there are a lot of people, it didn't seem too loud and our server was funny and there whenever we needed him.  We actually witnessed a proposal in their wine cellar which was super cute and the couple was obviously ecstatic.  This was a great place to spend our 5th wedding anniversary.  We enjoyed the views, the bar below was quick and not super full while we waited for our reservation time, and our dinner came with complete access to the two levels of viewing decks, including the glass floor.  We spent a bit of time down there after the meal and really enjoyed ourselves, even though it was still crowded for 11 p.m. Reservations are easy to make on their website so make sure you do that because it seemed like 95% of the tables were reserved when we arrived at 9 p.m. ANSWERNOTFOUND",Like many others,"(0, 16)",1,0.5,False

I first tried it a few years ago and it wasn't a good dining experience. Our waiter was ignorant, moody, and borderline b*tchy (did I mention it was a MALE waiter?) The service was so bad that I can't even remember how the food tasted. This year, I decided to give it another chance after a couple of my girlfriends convinced me that it's a good dining place and it's one of their favorites. So I went back for the Winterlicious event with my boyfriend. I ordered the Lobster soup (obviously), Lobster Tail fettuccine, and the Belgian choco mousse cake for dessert because they ran out of the mixed berry shortcake I originally wanted (my dining experience started to decline at this point). The boyfriend ordered Grilled calamari stuffed w/ risotto, Rib eye steak, and tiramisu for dessert (they misspelled tiramisu as tiramusi on the menu, which was such a turn off). I also ordered their special cocktail for the event, called Cabana. It tasted like a fruit punch. WHERE'S THE VODKA?!?!?!?!1. Appetizers: I have to admit that their Lobster soup was yummy. It's the best part of my sub-par dining experience. My boyfriend's stuffed calamari was also good and the portion was quite generous. 2. Main entrees: My lobster tail was quite big and grilled to perfection. The only thing I disliked about my main was the fettuccine. I like my pasta well done and it was al dente. It's just my personal preference and it's definitely not their fault. My boyfriend asked for a medium rare rib eye and when it came, he thought it was more of a medium to medium-well. Anyways, it was still a good piece of steak. My only itch about his dish was the veggie side. They used bokchoy out of all the greens out there! Believe me, I love my bokchoy, but NOT with steaks. It's like pairing BBQ pork with arugula. How do you like that? 3. Desserts: I was still upset that they ran out of the mixed berry shortcake and didn't have a fruity-type dessert as a replacement. I couldn't really enjoy the chocolate mousse cake because my first two dishes were already very creamy. I swapped my dessert with my boyfriend's tiramusi (haha!) and I definitely preferred that over the mousse cake. In the end, we didn't finish our dessert because the overall dining experience was just... underwhelming.A couple of things worth mentioning:- Our waiter was nice, attentive, but not annoying.- I noticed that a couple of other tables had some issues with their main courses. The guy beside us didn't finish his steak (1/2 of it was still on the plate) and when the waitress asked whether or not he would like to pack up the rest, he said no. THAT'S NOT A GOOD SIGN. Another table complained about one of the steaks being tough (overcooked?) and asked if they could get a replacement. The waitress tried to defend herself by saying that the steak looked overcooked because of the dim lighting in the restaurant. WTH?!? The patron said it was tough! She didn't even say it looked overcooked, she already tasted it before she complained! Oh boy...Anyway, I wouldn't go back to this place.Well, maybe for the Lobster soup.

Yes, I'm a Madonna. It's so easy to screw up fish and chips. You'd think it's easy to cook, but there really is an art to it. The right batter with good seasoning, the right temperature to the oil, crisp fries and for the love of God, fresh fish! So given the great ratings on Yelp, I was pretty excited to finally have the chance to try Fresco's... and boy was I disappointed. I was expecting greatness, but what I got was a small portion of overcooked, dry and flavorless fish and soggy and under seasoned fries for $15.I had the halibut, and being my first time I had it done half and half (half regular batter, half Ms. Vickie's).  The Ms. Vickie's batter is definitely the better of the two, have more crunch and texture, while the regular batter was soft and just not good. The fish wasn't overly oily, which is good, but the fish itself was very dry.  You know how in good fish and chips, the fish will flake apart? That lovely texture that just falls apart in your mouth? Well, this isn't it. The fish was chewy, dry and definitely wasn't seasoned. I ended up throwing a ton of seasoning salt, lemon and tartar sauce on it just to give it some life. Onto the second part of the equation: fries. They sure looked delicious, but again the lack of seasoning hurt the verdict, and the fries were a big soggy to boot.  I'm not trying to be dramatic, but I expected a lot more from a place which has a 4.5 stars average rating on Yelp (which I treat like the bible).It's not many times Yelp will disappoint me, but this was definitely one of them.

It came with a hott sauce and a vinaigrette, absolutely delicious. I highly recommend trying this appetizer.For our mains, we ate the Khao Soi & Chef Nuit's Pad Thai. The Khao Soi was delicious to the last spoonful. A variety of flavors run through your mouth in every bite. Spices were perfect, noodles were fresh and the soup was mouth watering. Chef Nuit's Pad Thai was an instant classic, watch for your heat request, they can get real spicy real fast, I requested for the spice to be on the side. Again, fresh flavors, tender meat, absolutely delicious.Price:Our bill came up to almost $75 before tip. We also drank Singha Beers & has a couple of Sake Bombs! So much fun.Overall, just writing this review and thinking about their food makes me crave them even more. Take a look at some of the photos I posted, but I suggest go have a bite in your free time to really appreciate the taste. This will be my new go to Thai Food place when the cravings hit.

Granted, the restaurant was not very busy, but there must be other things they could all be doing.  We were seated promptly, by a waitress that seemed very friendly and helpful.  That would be the only good point throughout the night - her helpfulness, and smile.  We looked over the menu, and were a bit surprised by the prices.  Most of the burgers were $10 or so, and didn't come with any sides.  I settled on a Bison burger, grilled, with red onion, roasted red peppers, lettuce, horseradish mayo, and barbecue sauce.  My girlfriend chose a regular beef burger with lettuce, tomato, cucumber wasabi mayo, and ketchup.  We also got a large order of fries to split, with gravy.We received a plate of celery and carrot sticks, as a starter.  It's one of the first impressions you have of a place, and when we were served 3 small pieces of celery and a few of what seemed to be carrot SHAVINGS, I was not impressed.  It just looked sad. Our burgers arrived within about 10 minutes, along with our fries and gravy.  First surprise, was how small the large order of fries was.  I am all for portion control, but this was barely enough for the two of us.  They were also quite heavily salted, and because they were served in a deep, small bowl they were clumped together and soggy.Now, I had ordered my burger medium well (they refused to do it medium rare, which already had me confused - wasn't this supposed to be a higher end burger joint?), because nothing is worse than a well done, dried out burger.  After two bites, I couldn't eat any more of mine - it was cooked to that horrible grey colour, all the way through, and was too dry to consume.   So I flagged down the hostess, and explained the situation.  She didn't seem at all surprised, and agreed to get me a new burger, this time done on the flat top grill (as I had hoped this would assure more juiciness).  While I was waiting for my burger to be re-served, my girlfriend commented on the issues with her burger. It too was fairly dry, and her wasabi mayo just tasted like mayo - zero kick to it at all.  Our waitress came back over, and offered me any item on the menu free, as apology for the mistake with the burger.  I wasn't expecting that sort of compensation for something I considered a minor mistake, but gladly accepted it.  I asked for the chicken fingers, and she smiled and went to get them.  To me though, it was a sign that they had issues like this frequently, to be comping things for customers without hesitation.  Sadly, the chicken fingers weren't much of an apology - they were bland, very small, greasy, and overcooked as well.  My burger showed up soon after, oddly with a whole wheat bun when I had originally ordered white.  But I was too frustrated at that point to bother pointing that out.  I immediately was greeted with wonderfully pink meat, in my first bite.  And the flat top had definitely brought more moisture to the burger.  But halfway through the burger, it was apparent that it was nearly as overdone as the first one.  It was dry, and mealy and I just couldn't finish it.  On top of the burger being overcooked, both the barbecue sauce and horseradish mayo were bland and flavourless.  It was just sad.  My girlfriend still wanted dessert, while I was done with the place.  She ordered apple pie a la mode, which appeared before us quickly, in the hands of a VERY apologetic waitress.  You see, the pie was a mess on the plate.  It wasn't in the shape of a slice of pie, because as the waitress explained, they take it from the freezer and heat it up (microwave it seemed), which causes the pie to just fall apart as the ice melts.  My girlfriend hesitantly accepted the slice, only to stop after one bite.  Why?  The pie dough was either raw, or had become mush from the freezing/microwaving procedure.  Fed up, we asked for the bill.  I would like to take this opportunity to say that our waitress was great.  She was prompt, apologetic, friendly, and never lost her smile.  She was really helpful, and we left her a tip.With the sheer amount of gourmet burger restaurants opening up all over Toronto, I do not think there is ANY excuse for W Burger Bar to be offering up such little quality, for so much money.

The atmosphere was casual and the setting of the dinner is like formal but not TOO formal, it's dim but not too dark or bright. And there's perfect amount of space between each table to allow for intimate dinner conversation but yet it's not silent because there's still a background noise. But the star of the show is probably the Sushi. We ordered momo (peach sake), the sake flight, the seaweed salad, the Miku sushi and red roll sushi, and the chefs recommendations for sushi. As well as the matcha fondue for dessert. The momo was DE-LICIOUS, so much so that I should have ordered more. The seaweed salad was very unique because it's not the type of seaweed you'd get in normal sushi restaurants - it's legit seaweed. The Miku sushi had to be my favorite, there's very little rice and it literally melts in your mouth with all the unique flavours. The matcha fondue is also delicious, it has just the right amount of matcha flavour that's not overwhelming and the lava cake...YUM. What made it 5 stars is also how they remembered to put the happy birthday message on the cake without any prompting. It was the perfect end to a lovely dinner. Yes it was on the expensive side but it's totally worth it as a treat to yourself or a special occasion. Bonus: they don't rush you out, they give you plenty of time at the restaurant.

If this place took bar reservations that would be one thing but they do not and so I was asked to rudely vacate my seat because this couple were clearly the bartender's friends. I have never in my entire life seen a restaurant have such disregard for their customers. From the time you try to book a reservation and having them tell you in no uncertain terms that unless your whole party shows up at the same time you will not get a table, to the just plain rudeness of the staff, I was literally flabbergasted. Specific examples of their poor service from last night alone:1/ My friend ordered a glass of rosé wine but referred to it as blush wine. Rather than the waiter simply clarifying what he was requesting, he rudely asked my friend what he was talking about, that he did not know what that was and ultimately in a very condescending way said you mean rosé?2/ I sat at the table for a good 20 minutes without even so much as an acknowledgment or someone offering to take my drink order - I had to call the waiter over.3/ This same waiter actually rolled his eyes when I changed my mind about the bottle of wine I wanted - clearly going back down to the cellar was extremely inconvenient for him even though that is his job!4/ When the bread came to the table we asked if we could have some balsamic vinegar for dipping. We were told that they do not have any and that they simply do not offer that, no exceptions. Side note: they really seems to have an issue with balsamic vinegar going so far as to highlight the items on their menu that would traditionally have this ingredient but do not at Terroni5/ My friend also asked for some butter for his bread preferring it to olive oil - again when we asked we were told they do not serve that. At this point we called the manager over who, rather than try to satisfy her customers, repeatedly kept saying that it is their policy not to serve butter. Policy??? What if my friend had been allergic to olive oil? When we suggested they bring some out on the plate from the kitchen she once again referred to their policy.6/ The one thing the manager did do right was assign a new server to our table as we expressed our displeasure with the service we had been receiving. Wanita came in and somewhat salvages the evening - she was very nice.I get that Terroni are trying to offer an authentic Italian experience and that they have a brand image they want to uphold but guess what Terroni, they eat butter and balsamic vinegar in Italy! The customer should ALWAYS come first. There is no place for this level of pretentious attitude in a city like Toronto where there are a plethora of restaurants to choose from.Enough about the service. The food was not memorable. I found the menu lacked creativity and variety especially with respect to the wine list. The pricing for what are in essence simple Italian dishes is ridiculously high for the average quality of food served.- No dipping sauce for calamari - the batter also smelled and tasted like KFC- Friend's seabream was overcooked - on a positive note they did take it back and made him a plate of pasta. However they did not give him a spoon to help him twirl his spaghetti- The wine list is ridiculously small and only features one wine from Puglia in southern Italy! For a restaurant that touts itself as an authentic southern Italian experience, it would have been nice to feature other southern regions such as Sicily, Campagna, Calabria or Salento.- The gnocchi was completely lacking in flavor and required the addition of a substantial amount of salt to bring out any flavor.- The agnelotti were good but again under seasoned and did require the addition of salt at the tableThere are much better places in Toronto for authentic Italian food, where the CUSTOMER IS KING.

What a way to end the trip! Everything here--the food, the service, and the presentation--was top notch. While we perused the food menu, I ordered the raspberry mojito martini (El Dorado 12-Year rum, fresh raspberries, prosecco, chambord raspberry liqueur, fresh lime, and mint), which was sweet, delicious, and strong. We had a hard time deciding what to order because everything on the menu looked amazing, but we ultimately went with Susur's signature Singaporean style slaw to start, which our server highly recommended (for good reason) followed by cheeseburger spring rolls (smoked chili mayo, pickled veg, lettuce wrap) and a special Ocean to Table platter, which I'll describe below. The slaw came in a beautiful mountain, which they mixed at our table. Once they served it, they removed the remainder to replate before returning it to us. At first, it seemed like the size of the dish was enormous, but it's so tasty and light that we made short work of it--so many great flavors and textures. My boyfriend was the one who ordered the spring rolls, which he said were amazing (I didn't try them for fear of being too full). The seafood platter was basically a sampler that included the following:--*Nova Scotia snow crab meat with avocado, sherry emulsion, fresh dill--Freshly shucked Colville Bay oysters wth sea buckthorne and Asian citrus gelee--PEI smoked slamon with yuzu and marjoram babaganoush, creme fraiche, wild acadian sturgeon caviar on squid ink crostini. --*Fresh scallop ceviche with salted plum and charred jalapeno vinaigrette--*Lobster Thailandaise with green mango and papaya salad, double smoked crispy bacon, cashews, chili and lime, Myogoa ginger flower--Shrimp cocktail with homemade assam horseradish cocktail sauceThe ones I marked with asterisks were my favorites, but all of the items were good. The only false note was the shrimp, which seemed overcooked to the point of being mushy. For dessert, we got the vanilla bean creme brulee (lemongrass, strawberry & gooseberry compote, butterfly pastry) and the signature French and Chinese tong yuen (warm sweet rice dumpling, chocolate nougat, Indian pastry, strawberry, crème brûlée, peach, and rosewater). Both were delicious, but two desserts was probably a little too much.The servers were attentive without being intrusive, they explained every dish as they served it, and they cleaned the table in between each course. Our main server even gave us recommendations about where to find live music after dinner.Not sure I'll ever be in Toronto again, but if I am, I would certainly return here for another memorable meal.

Although I should've been a little suspicious when nobody ever said Let's go to El Furniture Warehouse because they have great service! I am just going to start with the postitives. First has got to be the pricing of everything under $5. I mean you can't really go wrong with that since this area is surrounded by students from Highschool and University. The pricing is great for people who don't have tons of money to spend on some places located in the Annex. So that is definitely a great reason to come to this place. In terms of the quality of food.. I mean you get what you pay for. I thought that everything was decently good tasting. I got the Braised Beef Spaghetti, Beet and Goat Cheese Salad and a Mac and Cheese with bacon bits. Overall my favorite dish was the salad, second, Spaghetti and lastly the Mac and cheese. Everything was cooked well.. Nothing burnt or under cooked. Now with my experience. This is what I was so disappointed in the most when I got there. Let me just explain what I experienced  yesterday (Oct 23.14): Around 1PM my boyfriend and I decided to eat at El Furniture Warehouse since many people had recommended me to go. It is close to campus with cheap prices! Since I didn't have to work and it was pretty much a day off it was a great time to go. I thought going for a late lunch would be great. As we walked up to the place I noticed two people looking at the menu.. I guess they were deciding on take out. I notice immediately that it wasn't as busy as I've seen this place at night. Which was great - since we should be seated right away, right? WRONG! My boyfriend and I stood there trying to figure out, since it was our first time there, if it was a self seating place or if we had to wait for someone to have us seated. Finally after about a few minutes staring around awkwardly at each other and the people behind us, who were also waiting to be seated a waitress comes from the back and looks like she is going to get us seated. At first she was going to seat us at a high table that sits two people and across the bar but then she quickly asked us if we preferred to on the upper platform area at a table enough to sit four and we agreed to sit some where more spacious. Now this is something that I always do at every restaurant since I get thirsty quickly I told the waitress as she was about to leave to seat the other people behind us to get us two glasses of water to start. She said yes and continued her way down and sitting the other customers. As my boyfriend and I are deciding to pick what to eat we are looking around about 10 minutes later (maybe longer) still wondering where our water is. Finally I told him to bug another waitress who was wiping down a table near us to grab us water.. She said okay and in about 2 minutes our waitress brought us the water. I mean I would be a lot more understanding if it was extremely busy and if she had to wait for our food to be prepared and cooked but it's just water from a tap.. I couldn't believe we didn't just got our waters right away. I mean we had a girl on our left sitting near us who was seated AFTER we were and got her cocktail almost instantly well before we got our water. I just thought that was ridiculous. Finally when she brought the water we wasted no time to order our food so that we didn't have to wait so long for it to come out like our water. We used the time it took for the water to come out as an indicator as to how long the food would take and boy were we right! We ordered like I mentioned previously: beet salad, Mac and cheese and spaghetti. I think it took about 15-20 minutes for the food to come out. My boyfriend and I were both on our phones and trying to kill the time until our food arrived. When it arrived I was very happy with my selection though. Everything looked great. Until my boyfriend noticed right away on his Mac and cheese that they had forgotten the bacon bits! (Which the waitress actually suggested) Honestly he was so fed up with waiting for everything to come out that he almost didn't want to return it. However I am not like that.. I thought if you're going to suggest something and get your customers wanting to add items to their food then you shouldn't forget it. So it took us almost a few awkward minutes trying to wave a waitress in this not so busy place down. When we told her that she forgot she went Oh yeah I am so sorry about that and quickly went to the back sprinkled some bacon and popped back without dish. This is something I just cannot understand.Why was it that it seemed so busy for the waitress when there wasn't that many customers in the place to begin with. Anyways after all of this waiting game my boyfriend and I ate all of our food quickly and just wanted to get out of there. We paid for our meals I think I came to $18? And we just put a $20 down and left. What a frustrating experience. :(-CL ANSWERNOTFOUND",The pricing is great,"(394, 414)",1,0.75,True

Everything about it is amazing...from the service to the food to the facilities and atmosphere. Guu is most certainly deserving of 5 stars.First off...the atmosphere/service: You're always greeted in Japanese upon entering by the lively employees. (If only I could understand what they say!) Seating has been quite quick here in my experiences but I can understand that at peak times it may not be like that. There are three different types of seating setups here...bar-style seating by the cooking area, communal-type tables and then another seating area where you remove your shoes in traditional Japanese-style and sit by a sunken table. I've never had the opportunity to sit in the latter area but it looks like fun! It is a very loud restaurant so not exactly the preferred location for a quiet get-to-know-you date. GREAT location for birthday parties, as they take pictures of your party and give you a chalkboard to scroll down the birthday girl/boy's name.The food...AMAZING! You can't go wrong with your choices. I've never been let down! The bibimbap is a favourite of mine as are the kimchi udon noodles. Beer is cheap here too! The Sapporo always helps give it a more Japanese feel :)The facilities...very clean! A coat hangar area is provided which is convenient but I'm always skeptical about leaving my belongings where I don't have a direct line of vision. I'm still scarred by a previous coat-stealing experience elsewhere one fateful night.  As for the washrooms downstairs...they are impeccably clean. Each stall has its own beautiful sink (I know, I focus on little things like that hahaa) and amenities including mouthwash and cups (nice touch!).An amazingly Guu'd experience is had here ;) Run to Guu!

I left my name and number for our party of two as they said they will send us a message when it is our turn and happily headed to Aroma for a light snack and coffee while we wait.By 1:00 pm, we still didn't get a text or call and we thought it was a little odd and I was wondering if the number I provided was correct. We decided to walk back to Mildred's and spoke to the hostess explaining to her that we didn't get a text or call and we've been waiting for nearly 2 hours. They told us that, we didn't claim our table within 15 minutes of receiving the text message so they took our name off the waiting list. I wasn't so happy with this as I never received a text message from them. Fortunately, the head hostess sat us at a table shortly after.5/5 stars for our server! Our server was amazing (he has this adorable British accent) and was super attentive. He took our drink order and scone/biscuit order quickly and came back to take down our orders. He was a very timely man.3/5 for food. The food I ordered Veda's Choice (smoked salmon, egg, croissant) and he ordered the Manhandler (steak and eggs). My order was alright aside from the smoked salmon being unusually salty. His steak was ordered medium rare but it was cold when it arrived. I understand it won't be pipping hot as it is medium rare but it definitely should not be cold. We understand that they're a busy establishment but knowing that you're usually packed on Sunday.. are you short on staff or something?Overall, we were pretty disappointed with Mildred's.

Spicy Pork Udon - More like a kimchi udon with pork. Average, but the fact that the kimchi taste gets old and tiring after a million bites is a downside. Not much variety to this dish.

I didn't know how things worked so I just pulled up to a bench and waited. A staff member came over and explained that you have to order at the counter and they bring your food out to you.After perusing the menu I took Sarah L.'s suggestion and went with the Curry Wvrst. I also went with the staff member's recco on lamb for the type of wvrst. I piled on some duck fat fries and topped it off with a pint of Weihstephaner.While I was waiting for my meal someone came over who identified himself as a photographer for the Toronto Star. He was doing a story on the restaurant and asked if I would move over to the next bench so he could include me in some of his shots. I gladly obliged.After a short wait my lunch arrived. The meal was delicious. I definitely recommend the curry. It was tomato-based which went well with the wvrst and the fries. The fries come with a dipping sauce so my choice naturally was the Wvrst sauce. It had a nice tang to it but wasn't as spicy as I would have liked. Overall a really great experience.

He even suggested we ordered from light to heavy (ordering left to right on the menu).He was superb! His service was very polite, friendly and attentive.

You'd think we were all waiting in line for a club. The hostess desk was located outside, we were told it was a 45 min to an Hour wait, gave our name and number, and were told we would receive a text when our table was ready and we had 5 minutes to return or else we would lose our spot.I did like the idea of receiving the text so we could stroll around king street in the mean time. We were told we could go to the bar inside however it was soo crowded and packed we opted not to.About 40 mins later our table was ready. The restaurant itself is a pretty cool space, once an auto body shop now converted into an  Italian Trattoria. They have limited seating inside however they have a patio out front and on the roof.We were seated along a shared banquet at a cozy table along a mirrored wall. The restaurant was really packed and extremely loud yet with the dim lighting and candle light table it still managed to evoke a romantic ambiance.We started off with two glasses of Prosecco which was light, bubbly and refreshing.One of the highlights of this resto that they make there own wine on tap and sell it at $1 per ounce!Obviously I had to sample both the red and white at that price. As a predominately white wine drinker hands down I preferred the perfectly chilled light crisp Gusto Bianco - Pinot Grigio over the dry & more intensely flavoured Gusto Rosso - Cabernet Sauvignon & Malbec For apps we decided to split an Insalate Grande. Tagliata di Manzo - grilled flank steak, arugula, roasted grape tomatoes, shaved pecorino, balsamic vinaigretteDefinitely a Huge Salad! The hefty portion of perfectly cooked medium rare steak as requested was very tender and flavourful. Loved the balsamic dressing and peppery arugula and the roasted grape tomatoes were soo sweet and juicy.As a natural born pizza lover I knew what my main had to bePolpette - tomatoes, mozzarella, meatballs, smoked provoloneThe juicy halved meatballs remained tender and sheeted under a delicious smokey blanket of provolone. I couldn't help myself from picking them off and gobbling them down before a taking a bite into that thin and crispy crust. I think Gusto definitely takes the prize for crispiest crust! Loved biting into that crunch!And Finally DessertSmores Creme Brulee - Crispy bruleed topping covering a creamy marshmallow topping and rich dense chocolatey pudding and crumbled graham. Tiny portion but more than enough to satisfy a sweet tooth.Pistachio Gelato - Subtle pistachio flavour with vanilla undertones playing on both sweet and salty tastebuds. Again another small portion however ample enough to satisfy any sweet tooth.Disregarding the long wait for a table and receiving bread after completing half of our app, service during our meal was acceptable considering how busy the resto was. Everything we tasted was delicious and despite the loudness and packed quarters the vibe here definitely is electric with a trendy crowd.

Obviously, eating atop a giant tower in a revolving restaurant will inflate food and drink prices a bit.  There are two- and three-course meal options available and a la carte selections.  The meal options are a way better deal because you get similar (or the same) entree with additional food.  The three-course menu was $79CAD per person (about $60US per person).  Drinks were $5-$10US, so typical of a restaurant/bar.  Some of the cocktails were a bit pricier but also fancier so you get what you pay for.  I enjoyed my soup (yellow tomato and corn gazpacho) and baked ziti with wild mushrooms.  There weren't a ton of mushrooms in the entree, but the ziti and chili sauce were delicious.  My husband got the aged ribeye entree and really enjoyed it.  It was a little too rare (even though he ordered medium rare) so maybe make sure they cook it medium throughout and not just one section of the cut.  Since they served bread before the meal, I filled up on a bit too much of that (there was some waiting between app and entree) so I almost couldn't finish my dessert.  I had the sorbet which was delicious and my husband had ice cream and cookies, which he loved.  The homemade fig newton was yummo.   Obviously, the view is excellent.  It takes 72 minutes for the restaurant to make one full rotation and they seem to have dinner timed pretty well to coincide with that revolution.  We basically ended where we started (a little later) so we were only up there for like 90 minutes.  Even though there are a lot of people, it didn't seem too loud and our server was funny and there whenever we needed him.  We actually witnessed a proposal in their wine cellar which was super cute and the couple was obviously ecstatic.  This was a great place to spend our 5th wedding anniversary.  We enjoyed the views, the bar below was quick and not super full while we waited for our reservation time, and our dinner came with complete access to the two levels of viewing decks, including the glass floor.  We spent a bit of time down there after the meal and really enjoyed ourselves, even though it was still crowded for 11 p.m. Reservations are easy to make on their website so make sure you do that because it seemed like 95% of the tables were reserved when we arrived at 9 p.m. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2386, 2400)",5,0.0,False

Even the Goddess of Alcohol which was described as the strongest drink on the menu had a good level of sugar going on.  The sangria was by far the most dry of the bunch, with a good hit of brandy in the mix.  Personally, however, I thought the best cocktails were the Cucumber Devil and the Mayan, which were refreshing and well-balanced with a nice kick of heat.  My least favourite of the bunch was Watermelon Fire because the watermelon was almost syrupy and artificial tasting. I also wouldn't want to finish an entire Aqua de Coco since I'm not a fan of creamy booze drinks at all. Having said that, there were so many tempting options on the menu, I'm sure with a little more sampling (g-d help me), I'd find even more boozy favourites.The food at El Catrin has been imagined and executed by Olivier LeCalvez, a French-trained, Cordon Bleu Mexico culinary instructor who was recruited straight from Mexico for the opening.  His approach seems to be to combine traditional preparations with local flavours and playful presentations.  In comparison to most of the new tapas style restaurants in the city, El Catrin touts a beast of a menu (emphasized by the literal size of the menu itself). Thankfully, to somewhat help with the navigation, the offerings are broken down into sections: Botanas, Cubetas (Shrimp), Burritos, Tostadas, Tortas, Ceviches, Tacos, Especialidades (Specials), Parillada (grilled items) and dessert. They also have special menus for children (Young Amigos), and patrons who want to eat gluten free.  After much deliberation, we decided to opt for:Guacamole En La Mesa: Avocado, Tomato, Red Onion, Cilantro, Serrano Chili ($9)Made table-side, I thought the guac was a solid first course.  Maybe a bit expensive for the quantity (we literally each got a few chips worth and then had to violently scrape the bowl), but a well seasoned, balanced guacamole. Ensalada de Esquites: Steamed Corn, Cilantro, El Catrin Aioli, Chili Piquin Powder, Quesillo Cheese ($8 for 3)This basically reminded me of a deconstructed street corn. It was much easier to eat than gnawing on a cob and getting white crèma on your face, but not quite as good. I definitely enjoyed it (because I can't imagine not enjoying fresh corn), but I did find it to be a bit too salty to want to eat much more than the shot glass-worth.Sopes: Corn Tortilla Stuffed with Black Bean Puree, Pulled Chicken, Salsa Verde, Lettuce and Queso Fresco ($12 for 2)I wasn't going to even order this but I was so glad our server talked me into it as it turned out to be my favourite dish of the night. The sopes had this cushion-like texture and a mild sweet flavour, that when combined with the moist chicken, earthy beans, fresh salsa, and salty cheese, was perfectly in balance. So while I found the portion a little on the small side for the price, I would without question order it again.Ceviche de Atun: Fresh Tuna, Lime, Olive Oil, Watermelon, Chive and Habanero Mignonette ($10)Good but not something I would order again. For $10, there was very little tuna in the dish, and the habanero mignonette was so spicy I couldn't appreciate the delicate flavours of the melon and mild fish. The combination definitely has great potential, but the exact composition could use adjustment.Tacos Baja: Crispy Fried Haddock, Red Slaw, Chipotle Dip, Salsa Roja, Flour Tortilla ($15 for 3) A big time favourite at the table. The fish was light and moist with a blissfully crispy batter. The chipotle dip, albeit a bit excessive in ratio with the rest of the ingredients, was admittedly ridiculously addictive. I could eat a platter of these without thinking about it.Gringas: Flour Quesadilla with Pastor Pork, Pineapple, Cilantro, Sliced Onion and Mild Gouda Cheese ($9)Tasty, but safe. Unlike most commercial flour tortillas, this one was as light as a crepe. I only wished that there was a little more filling packed in and maybe a bit more caramelization on the outside- something to yield some textural contrast because the dish was a bit one note- mild in flavour and relatively soft in texture.Costilla Corta En Mole Negro: Beef Short Rib Braised 24 Hours with Black Mole Sauce, Sweet Potato Puree, Sauteed Sugar Snap Peas ($14)This was a recommendation of our servers, and I was really glad we went for it. The short rib was impossibly tender and meaty, with very little residual fat to omit. I also loved the pairing of the complex and slightly bitter mole sauce with the light and fragrant sweet potato.Cemita de Pibil Torta: Axiote Braised Pulled Pork, Pickled Red Onion, Chihuahua Cheese, Habanero Glaze ($12)We all took a bite and instantly agreed- it reminded us of Fidel Gastros famous Stg.

I've visited the Cheesecake Factory in the USA before and was so excited when I heard they were bringing it to Toronto. I heard iffy reviews but I had to go for myself and it was very good. We went on Sunday morning arriving around 11:00am, we were advised there was a 75-90 minute wait, which I already expected. We were given a buzzer, we only ended up waiting about 60 mins to get seated. The restaurant was very busy but all the staff was very pleasant. We had two different waitresses as they were having their break time, both waitresses were very kind and accommodating. One person dining with me wanted a breakfast plate with bacon and pancakes, it also came with eggs but they didn't eat eggs, so they were kind enough to omit the eggs and provide extra bacon in place of it. Other guests ordered a breakfast burrito, California cheesesteak. They all enjoyed their meals very much. As for my meal (pictures below) - I ordered a Peach Smoothie with the Four Cheese Pasta as my entree and an Oreo Cheesecake to go because I was too full from my meal. The smoothie was delicious, no complaints there. The pasta was good, it's the one dish I would always order in the US. It was slightly dry but once I mixed everything together it was perfect. The portion sizes are very large, when I was finished it barely looked like I ate any pasta as my plate was still full. Even the size of the smoothie, was large. The cheesecake portions are also large. I could barely eat half a piece to myself so definitely think about sharing a slice. All in all dinner was great, atmosphere is nice, it's a bit loud because of all the people but I would definitely dine here again. Hopefully more restaurants open in the GTA so reservations can be made and wait times can be made shorter. However, even when dining at the Cheesecake Factory in the US I usually had a 30-45 minute wait. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1897, 1911)",2,0.0,False

They are wrong. Although the $2 Banh Mis are a steal, and make for a quick lunch, you are certainly getting what you pay for when you go to Banh Mi Boys. My sandwich came up to $6.77, which was very reasonable for what I got. This place must have an immense amount of pressure to keep their prices down given a) the competition in the areab) the fact that most people who know what a Banh Mi is are used to paying $2 on SpadinaTherefore, the fact that they can offer what they do at this price point is impressive.The Food (Pork Belly Sandwich):- The bread was very fresh, tasty, and was toasted perfectly (not too hard, not too soft)- There was a decent amount of tasty, tender meat. It was a little fatty, but this is to be expected from pork belly- The meat was of good quality; leaps and bounds better than the mystery meat of the classic $2 Banh Mi. - The vegetables were also very fresh, and I enjoyed how there was a pickle in the sandwich which I have never had before- The hot sauce was great as always (I'm a big fan of this sweet hot sauce in Banh Mi sandwiches)- I asked for spicy, and the hot sauce was unevenly distributed with one half being medium and the other half being very hot. This isn't a deal breaker, but just an observation.The atmosphere:- Loved the music they were playing in here. Great old school hip hop playing at good volume- The decor was decent. I liked the lamp shades on the lights- The staff was friendly and helpful.- The cleanliness of the place was pretty poor, and this is why the place gets a 3, instead of the 4 it would have received if it was cleaner. There were discarded napkins and food under every single table, with as many as 10 or more discarded napkins under some tables. The 2 tables that were free had varying degrees of mess on the tables from previous customers. There were no tables whose tops were completely clean. I can understand that some customers are quite messy and that the employees may not have had time to clean up after these people, but given that there was a mess under and on every table indicates to me that staff had not cleaned in while, and did not care about the establishment's general cleanliness. One of my biggest pet peeves at a fast food joint is when the place is this messy, because it makes me feel like I'm eating in a barn.That being said, the food here was great, and I will go back to this place, and change my review if the place cleans itself up.

I'll have to come back to give it a try.To start we ordered the duck tacos and had the option to add a fourth so we wouldn't have to fight over the extra taco. The duck taco had a great balance of flavours and textures with the pickled carrot, the sweet hoisin sauce and fatty duck. Each taco was quite small so the additional taco was a good call.For our main we ordered the Sampler for Two and chose brisket, ribs and chicken for our meats, and fries, asparagus and cuban corn for our sides. Both the chicken and ribs were tender and delicious. The brisket on the other hand was just ok. It wasn't as tender as I was hoping it to be. I have no complaints about the sides though. The cuban corn was sweet and spicy, the asparagus was perfectly cooked and had a nice smoky flavour, and the fries were crispy and served with a delicious aioli. The meal and service was great.

Having eaten at both I'd have to agree that the timing was decidedly convenient in its indication that that claim was true. Still, there are a few differences. Both have secret menus. Both have their own version of the Big Mac sandwich. Both have order counters and then seating areas for the hardcore. And both grind their beef fresh daily. But I'd give kudos to Burger's Priest for a few reasons: While imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, they were the original. Secondly, they're the better of the two. Lastly, while neither is incredibly cheap, the imitator (Holy Chuck) is more expensive ($38 for two burgers, one fry and two sodas). Holy Chuck is a good, decent burger. I ordered their Big Mac and it was delicious. The fries were tasty. The soda was soda, although they do have those cool Pininfarina machines. But what put me off was that there was simply not enough effort here to justify a $38 price tag for two burgers and a side. This is still a take out counter just like McDonald's, and while the quality is obviously higher here when it comes down to it, its a hamburger and it tastes an awful lot like you're getting charged too much, especially when up the street at McD's it's still $10 for the Big Mac combo (and that's supersized).You won't be disappointed, but I wasn't overly impressed.

We also got the heirloom tomato salad, the poached cod, the beef short ribs, the rice cakes and the chanterelles. My favourite dish was definitely the rice cakes, they were spicy but not painfully spicy. All of the food was really good and I would recommend someone to order our exact order except maybe the heirloom tomato salad as that didn't really wow me. My only complaint about Daisho is the cocktail list. I expected a higher level of drinks available- more unique tasting cocktails with fruits, flowers, etc. I had the lavender lemonade and it literally just looked and tasted like a normal lemonade. Other than the drink list I would happily return to Daisho! It was oddly affordable too we split all of our dishes between 5 of us and I had two cocktails and my bill was only $60.

Also not the typical choices you have at most Thai restaurants, which is a nice change of pace.  It's like a menu of Thai comfort food.  For my first time here, I dined in.  A couple of my friends ordered the Tom Yum soup and raved about it.  It looked pretty good loaded with shrimps, mushrooms and whatnots.  I asked the waitress for a recommendation and she said everything is good but one of her favorites is the Pad Gra Prow.  After going with that, I decided I could dine here every day and did so for the next 3 days.  I'm hesitant to order the pad Thai because I tried a bite of my friend's pad Thai and didn't like it (soggy and bland).  Pad Gra Prow (pork with basil) with Fried Egg ($12) - One of my favorite dishes in Thailand but is rarely done right elsewhere.  However, they did it very right here, top notch. The flavors were authentic (could be saltier as it was on the sweet side) and delicious!  It even came with a side of chili fish sauce (prik nam pla!), which was not needed, but was nice to be offered.  The pork was minced to perfection.  The portion of rice given was also spot on.Thai Omelette with ground pork and rice $12 was absolutely tasty.  This is not your traditional omelette as it was deep fried scramble eggs.  It had ground pork but it also had dried shredded pork (moo yong), which I haven't had in the longest time.  There were also basil, onion and red pepper that added to the great flavor of this dish.Massaman with Braised Beef and Rice $12 - If you're in the mood for coconut based red curry, tender beef, and potatoes, you'll like this dish.  There are also onions and peanuts in here which I really enjoyed.Thai chicken fried rice $11 - It was ok, kinda plain.  I got it as a takeout and it could have used some fish sauce.  Unfortunately, I didn't have any at the office.  Where's the prik nam pla when I needed it?Small Tom Yum Soup $5 - This soups is pretty good.  I got it medium spicy and it was just the right amount of spiciness.  There were 2 jumbo shrimps in the soup.Thai Ice Tea ($4.50) - They didn't have Thai ice coffee, so I went with this.  It's a bit more expensive than other places, but they do give you a big cup of it.  Mango and sticky rice $8 - One of my favorite Thai desserts.  It was good here, but not quite $8 good.   I'll can go to Sabai Sabai for my Thai dessert fix for $5.The service was friendly.  The décor is nice and gives the place a Thai ambience and not just Thai themed.

What a way to end the trip! Everything here--the food, the service, and the presentation--was top notch. While we perused the food menu, I ordered the raspberry mojito martini (El Dorado 12-Year rum, fresh raspberries, prosecco, chambord raspberry liqueur, fresh lime, and mint), which was sweet, delicious, and strong. We had a hard time deciding what to order because everything on the menu looked amazing, but we ultimately went with Susur's signature Singaporean style slaw to start, which our server highly recommended (for good reason) followed by cheeseburger spring rolls (smoked chili mayo, pickled veg, lettuce wrap) and a special Ocean to Table platter, which I'll describe below. The slaw came in a beautiful mountain, which they mixed at our table. Once they served it, they removed the remainder to replate before returning it to us. At first, it seemed like the size of the dish was enormous, but it's so tasty and light that we made short work of it--so many great flavors and textures. My boyfriend was the one who ordered the spring rolls, which he said were amazing (I didn't try them for fear of being too full). The seafood platter was basically a sampler that included the following:--*Nova Scotia snow crab meat with avocado, sherry emulsion, fresh dill--Freshly shucked Colville Bay oysters wth sea buckthorne and Asian citrus gelee--PEI smoked slamon with yuzu and marjoram babaganoush, creme fraiche, wild acadian sturgeon caviar on squid ink crostini. --*Fresh scallop ceviche with salted plum and charred jalapeno vinaigrette--*Lobster Thailandaise with green mango and papaya salad, double smoked crispy bacon, cashews, chili and lime, Myogoa ginger flower--Shrimp cocktail with homemade assam horseradish cocktail sauceThe ones I marked with asterisks were my favorites, but all of the items were good. The only false note was the shrimp, which seemed overcooked to the point of being mushy. For dessert, we got the vanilla bean creme brulee (lemongrass, strawberry & gooseberry compote, butterfly pastry) and the signature French and Chinese tong yuen (warm sweet rice dumpling, chocolate nougat, Indian pastry, strawberry, crème brûlée, peach, and rosewater). Both were delicious, but two desserts was probably a little too much.The servers were attentive without being intrusive, they explained every dish as they served it, and they cleaned the table in between each course.

At $76 it's certainly not cheap, but it's worth every penny. Our waiter, who was extremely knowledgeable about steak and a very good communicator, explained that this farm mostly feeds the cows grass but they also add other grains later on to improve the marbling of the steak. My wife doesn't eat as much meat, so she had the 8-ounce, grass-fed tenderloin from Lindsay, ON, which was leaner. Our waiter's explanation about the aging process of the steak was quite interesting. It has to do mostly with enzymes breaking down over time and improving the flavour. After a certain number of days, this essentially stops happening. The number of days required varies by the type of steak, but most seemed to be in the 40-50 day range. The steak is stored in a humidity-controlled fridge and develops a crust that is removed prior to cooking.With each steak they bring out some salts and sauces. The salts are quite interesting, but I wouldn't over do it, lest you overpower the flavour of the steak. The blue cheese spread is where it's at though! I normally don't like extra spreads and sauces on steak, but this is truly amazing! A steak at Jacobs with just a little bit of this blue cheese spread will be one of the best things you've ever tasted if you're a steak lover. I can't stress this enough.You can get your steak pre-sliced, which is great if you want to share a steak among a group, which is the only way you'd ever order one of the 40-ounce steaks, I would hope! I prefer to cut my own steak, but it's nice to have this option. Both our steaks were done perfectly medium rare. These guys have it down to a science.We started with the caesar salad, which is made from scratch beside your table. This was fun to watch, and it really was the best caesar salad we'd ever had. There is a huge difference between this and your typical restaurant offering. You can really taste the pepper and Worcester sauce in every bite.For sides, we had the green beans with brown butter and almonds and the duck fat french fries. The beans were interesting as they were really crunchy, and they complemented our meal well. The duck fat fries were also good, but it's a very heavy side if you're also eating a massive steak, so it might not have been the best choice for us.Somehow we still managed to order dessert and had the sticky toffee pudding. This was a great dish and the portion size wasn't too big, which was a relief after ordering all of the above. The toffee had a really great flavour and consistency.In terms of drinks, there is a long wine list, quite a few bottled beers available and a number of cocktails. We stuck with the cocktails and enjoyed most of them. The Pilot and the Rusty Nail were our favourites.The service is simply phenomenal. There is attention to every detail. They even clean up your crumbs between courses!I could go on and on about this restaurant, but this is already my longest review ever, so I'll just conclude by saying that if you're a steak lover who lives in the GTA or is visiting Toronto, you absolutely must come here for dinner.

In the end though, the food is delicious and that should be what matters most!The vibe:-The space that the restaurant occupies is incredible. Huge ceilings, beautiful light fixtures and accent pieces, it's a really trendy vibe with plenty of room for bigger groups. Unfortunately, the vibe of much of the crowd was very corporate, understandable given its location, but they're not on my top 5 lists of crowds. The service was attentive, maybe even somewhat obtrusively so. I won't fault them for that though.The drinks:-An intriguing cocktail menu, I ordered the Smokin' Manhattan which had tobacco-infused Rye (basically steeped with a cigar), lovely velvety texture and cigar-like smokiness made it worth the $14. The beer menu was decent but lacking in the stouts or porters I would prefer in the Winter weather. The food:-Started the meal with the Fried Chicken Skins, which was a nice greasy nibble before starting an actual meal. Not sized as an appetizer but delicious nonetheless. I ordered the Octopus/Lobster gumbo and split a Hot Mess with a friend who ordered the Jerk Cornish Hen. Overall, the gumbo had good flavour, and while it was a small portion, there was ample octopus and lobster found within it. The Jerk Hen was nice though I prefer my Jamaican seasoning on the spicier side. The star of the meal was the Hot Mess, a diabolical combination of sweet potato, brisket, sour cream, and cheese curds. Delicious and the brisket had a great smoky flavour that made me wish that I had given the smokepit a shot (I've avoided going full-BBQ since a recent trip to Texas made everything pale in comparison). Ended the meal with a Cheddar Cheese ice cream sandwich. Quite peculiar, it was a cheddar cheese blended ice cream within two wafers topped with parmesan-like cheese. The smell was pretty intensely savoury but the taste was great. I think I liked it? My overall impression:-A trendy, pricey BBQ spot in a neighbourhood that caters to a corporate crowd. The food makes up for any pejorative aspects of those words.

I ordered the Bison steak a la carte and asparagus.  The bison was recommended to be cooked medium rare, which wasn't a problem.  Bison tasted okay.  It was not anything unbelievable or I would crave again.  The asparagus was generic and served with a piece of butter on top. My girlfriend ordered the 2 course meal.  She had a Caesar salad with bacon.  The salad came with a drizzle of dressing and a couple nice big chunks of bacon.  She loved the bacon but the salad was too plain for her because of the lack of dressing.  The waiter recommended she try the arugula ricotta agnolotti.  It basically looked like a pirogi shaped noodle stuffed with arugula ricotta.  It tasted very bitter and she did not like it at all.  She took half a bite and left the rest.  The waiter came around and we told him that she did not really like it and she ordered a side of fries lol.  The waiter did not really make any attempts to try to fix the situation and maybe offer her half off the entree or a free dessert.  I should add I tried a piece of the dish and it really was very bland and bitter.  Nothing I would enjoys. Overall it is something someone should experience but the food is not anything amazing.

If this place took bar reservations that would be one thing but they do not and so I was asked to rudely vacate my seat because this couple were clearly the bartender's friends. I have never in my entire life seen a restaurant have such disregard for their customers. From the time you try to book a reservation and having them tell you in no uncertain terms that unless your whole party shows up at the same time you will not get a table, to the just plain rudeness of the staff, I was literally flabbergasted. Specific examples of their poor service from last night alone:1/ My friend ordered a glass of rosé wine but referred to it as blush wine. Rather than the waiter simply clarifying what he was requesting, he rudely asked my friend what he was talking about, that he did not know what that was and ultimately in a very condescending way said you mean rosé?2/ I sat at the table for a good 20 minutes without even so much as an acknowledgment or someone offering to take my drink order - I had to call the waiter over.3/ This same waiter actually rolled his eyes when I changed my mind about the bottle of wine I wanted - clearly going back down to the cellar was extremely inconvenient for him even though that is his job!4/ When the bread came to the table we asked if we could have some balsamic vinegar for dipping. We were told that they do not have any and that they simply do not offer that, no exceptions. Side note: they really seems to have an issue with balsamic vinegar going so far as to highlight the items on their menu that would traditionally have this ingredient but do not at Terroni5/ My friend also asked for some butter for his bread preferring it to olive oil - again when we asked we were told they do not serve that. At this point we called the manager over who, rather than try to satisfy her customers, repeatedly kept saying that it is their policy not to serve butter. Policy??? What if my friend had been allergic to olive oil? When we suggested they bring some out on the plate from the kitchen she once again referred to their policy.6/ The one thing the manager did do right was assign a new server to our table as we expressed our displeasure with the service we had been receiving. Wanita came in and somewhat salvages the evening - she was very nice.I get that Terroni are trying to offer an authentic Italian experience and that they have a brand image they want to uphold but guess what Terroni, they eat butter and balsamic vinegar in Italy! The customer should ALWAYS come first. There is no place for this level of pretentious attitude in a city like Toronto where there are a plethora of restaurants to choose from.Enough about the service. The food was not memorable. I found the menu lacked creativity and variety especially with respect to the wine list. The pricing for what are in essence simple Italian dishes is ridiculously high for the average quality of food served.- No dipping sauce for calamari - the batter also smelled and tasted like KFC- Friend's seabream was overcooked - on a positive note they did take it back and made him a plate of pasta. However they did not give him a spoon to help him twirl his spaghetti- The wine list is ridiculously small and only features one wine from Puglia in southern Italy! For a restaurant that touts itself as an authentic southern Italian experience, it would have been nice to feature other southern regions such as Sicily, Campagna, Calabria or Salento.- The gnocchi was completely lacking in flavor and required the addition of a substantial amount of salt to bring out any flavor.- The agnelotti were good but again under seasoned and did require the addition of salt at the tableThere are much better places in Toronto for authentic Italian food, where the CUSTOMER IS KING.

The girl working in front apologized and gave me another cake quickly. I checked it again and it looked okay.  The shape of the cake was definitely not as round and raised as the original one,  but I let that pass.  Fast forward to when I got home. I let it sit in the fridge for a couple of hours and then took it out to cut and eat. The cake fell apart while I was cutting it, unlike the clean cut with the original cake. The taste was pretty good, it has a Japanese  cheesecake taste with a punch of matcha, but the texture was off. It was still a bit too wet and slightly undercooked.

I ordered the Works Burger with fries (comes with your choice of either fries, a soup or a salad), and the fried apple pie (comes with vanilla icecream - which they should consider selling alone because what if you don't have the room for the apple pie but you have a second stomach for icecream?). I enjoyed both of them. Their portion sizes are great too! We paid for our bills individually, and could see that the server automatically put in a 20% tip, without disclosing it at all. Kind of rude, no? At least tell your customers in advance. ANSWERNOTFOUND",food was pretty,"(58, 73)",2,1.0,True

The curry noodles were delicious, came with fried crisps but after about 6 bites you get sick of it since it is very very rich. I packed the rest up. My boyfriends rice wasn't really interesting in flavor, just really spicy. He said the Tom yum soup didn't taste right either so he didn't end up finishing it. The milk tea was very very good though, edging on very sweet but overall would recommend.Overall the experience was ok.

Music is great, portions are very generous and servers are very laid back yet attentive.  I do have some criticism following my most recent visit which I'll leave to the end.  Let's start off with the goodies first.Golden Hashbrown Poutine - Not your average poutine but definitely worth a try if you love any form of potato and like to try new things.  Their gravy is on point and if you also don't mind runny eggs, this is definitely a must try.  The two compliment each other quite well.  With the runny eggs, do keep in mind that if prefer your eggs cooked, they can't cater to this.  Alterations are actually not accepted here so be sure to read the menu to avoid disappointment.  Anywho, although this wasn't my order, I would personally go back for this. 5/5. Super Cheesy Bacon French Toast - If you can't decide between sweet or savoury, order this.  Not only will this dish satisfy both palettes, it'll keep your belly happy for most of your day.  What also goes perfectly with this would be their side of greens which, I find, helps cleanse your palette after every bite.  Think of it as the ginger slices with your sushi.  5/5.Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffles - This was the first place in Toronto where I've had chicken & waffles.  Although I've had *the original* c&w at Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles, this is not too shabby.  Waffles are nice and fluffy, chicken is nice and crispy on the outside yet juicy on the inside.  Roscoe's is still my fave but this is definitely next in line.  I have however, have yet to try other places. 4/5. I've had a few other things here but they are no longer on the menu.  But if you're curious, they were all still quite good.  Place is also great for small events including small weddings.  Had actually attended one a couple of years ago and the purpose of my last visit was to also scope out the place for another potential wedding.  It was my friend's (bride to be) first visit here and hopefully the experience during that last visit didn't take them off the list.Now I'd like to just go over the little criticism that I had first mentioned.  The only criticism I have about the place is the fact that they don't take reservations for brunch but then again, that's the norm at Liberty Village restaurants that offer brunch.  However, when you're waiting for your table during the colder days of Toronto, it's not exactly pleasant. They have this nice patio area at the front which would be very ideal for people to wait so perhaps management would look into investing in some of those heaters for their waiting customers? I understand that you can get a text when your table is ready but you need to also consider the fact that your customers are paying for parking and there aren't too many places to kill time around there that aren't restaurants.And speaking of waiting for your table, when we went here this past Sunday, the host told me that they generally give those next in line 5 to 10 minutes to get back before they release their table.  Well, over 20 minutes had passed when the party finally arrived.  Quite unfair to everyone else who have been waiting in the cold and/or cramped up waiting area.  Also with the waiting area which is really the space between the door and the host being cramped, there must be some fire code violation here. Anyway, maybe just something for management to consider.

Had to guess it'll just be dividing the cost of 3 tacos and add 2 in there.  When the Fish Tacos came, it came with an added bonus of a piece of hair, you can tell that it's not Hair on your head.  we don't want to get into details about it, but after waiting yet another 10 minutes to spot Laura, we told her what happened and she did apologize (at least she did this right).  She also apologized for the wait as she is WAITING for a coffee to be made.  I asked for more water, didn't come.Other foods came as well, but there isn't really anything special, details about the food at the bottom.We ordered drinks after and waited ANOTHER 10 minutes for them.  I don't know what it is about their drinks, whenever someone orders them, it's like they have to wait at the bar or something for drinks.  I ask for water a second time, didn't happen.Spotting her refilling water with a jug nearby, we ordered food a second time after all the dishes came out, she took our orders and left an empty water jug on the table all the way till the end of the meal even though she had came to our table a few times. We ordered the Huarache Albanil (chorizo), but a dish came that don't look at all like Chorizo, and the server that brought it to us called it some other name that I didn't catch and then I ask her if it is chorizo and she said oh sorry, my bad, I meant to say Chorizo.  We weren't buying it, so we waited yet another 5 minutes to ask Laura, and she confirmed that it is the wrong dish and look it away.I asked for water one final time with a tone of dissatisfaction, she came with water and an apology.  She admitted it was terrible service throughout the meal and want to make up for it with 2 treats for my mom and brother since it's their birthday.  It was 2 mini sponge cakes with whipped cream and some crumbled corn flakes on top.  It was an extra wet sponge.  Very sad.I asked for the bill and checked the bill, I saw the two tiny 2inch treats on the bill at 7 bucks each!  I called her again and ask her what is this (pointing to the treats on the bill), she said oops! that was embarrassing!  Had I not check it, what would happen?Finally, credit card machine.  She hand it over to be but STOOD right beside me when I enter tips and everything as if she is afraid of not getting any tips.

Costilla Corta - a 24hr slow braised short rib on a menu that says for sharing and came out a bit larger than a golf ball.  Sure, flavours are there, but very dinky.4. Pulpo Canitas - Confit of Octopus, This one is very good, very interesting flavours and sauces, worth it.5. Huarache Albanil - Chorizo on a torilla.

This was my first time at the restaurant. Our server, Stephani, was excellent. I was also very impressed with the decor. However, I was not impressed by the food, especially given the high price. The Baja tacos were flavorful but the use of a flour tortilla rather than a corn tortilla took away from the experience. I think you would struggle to find a taquiera that uses flour tortillas with fish tacos, as these are usually reserved for grilled meat fillings. The Yucatan Cochinita Pibil was very dry on the inside, but the whole taco was unreasonably wet with juices. I was disappointed to see the use of one rather than two corn tortillas per taco, as is the practice amongst some taquieras, depending on the consistency of the filling. At over $5.00 per taco, I was expecting much better food. I understand that part of the draw is the location, decor, and outdoor heated patio, but I would have a tough time believing that any Mexican would dine at your restaurant for the tacos. I have been to taquieras in Tijuana, Mexico and California that served cheap and more satisfying tacos than the ones I had tonight.The double mojito was great, no complaints. It was $14.00 but I didn't think that was as unreasonable as the price of the tacos.Perhaps I missed something better on the menu. I would be amendable to giving your restaurant a second chance, but based on this experience, I have a tough time justifying it or recommending it to friends or colleagues.The total bill came to $63.17. This would buy about 20 tacos, plus drinks, at somewhere like El Trompo in Kensington Market (run by a Mexican family). If that is a little too no-frills to make a comparison, take La Carnita's tacos, for example. Although their tacos are not what one may call authentic, they taste a whole lot better than yours at a slightly reduced price.I know that Olivier La Calvez is a highly trained chef, but totally missed the mark on these tacos. I can't believe he would put his name to them.I haven't been this upset about a restaurant experience in ages, and I am certainly not a picky customer.

Aside from the expansive and cosy patio they have here, the interior of the restaurant is simply gorgeous - Giant tequila/liquor wall at the bar area, colorful decor, edgy wall art, rustic wood tables, to the Mexican wrestling mask in black lighting - all give a very fun and energetic vibe. It is very clear you will have a fun time here.Of course, good decor means little if the food is not up to snuff. Me and my dining companions had a tasting of various dishes. We were started off with some guacamole and chips, with the avocado smashed at table side. It came with a variety of sauces from mild to hot, and also some crickets in a mild chili oil. The guac was very fresh and tasty, and it was neat to try the crickets which are very rich in protein.The Atun Ahi tuna ceviche - with watermelon, Yucateco mignonette, lime and chives, was light and refreshing. It went well with some chips as well and got the appeitite going.The Esquites were surprisingly good - made with charred corn off the cob, epazote, chiptole aioli and lime. Even though it's in a shot glass, it is a warm dish, and the flavour of the freshly grilled corn with the aioli was amazing! I would say this is a must-get.Sopes de Tinga - pulled chicken chipotle with tomato stew, black bean puree, lettuce, crema fresca, queso cotija on corn flour masa. This was delicious as well and well worth trying.Pescado Nayarit - Grilled beeline snapper that is marinated in chile ancho, served whole and de-boned. Came with corn tortila, avocado and salsa martajada. A great dish if you feel like having some fish tacos.Pollo Almendrado - Chicken supreme in almond sauce, fried plantains, chayote squash, sauteed zucchini. This was my favorite dish of the night. The chicken was prepared perfectly and was moist and tender. It had a nice crispiy skin, and the almond sauce was really delicious with it. Everybody at the table loved it and I would put this on the must-get list as well.For dessert, we had some churros - they were pretty large, and yet very light and airy which are perfect. Easily the best churros I have ever had. We also had the Xocolatl (Mexican mousse, candied confir papaya and almond brittle). Surprisingly the Xocolatl was our least favorite item of the evening, as we were expecting something sweet at the end but it was not that sweet at all.Throughout the night we also had various drinks and they were all quite delicous. We split a pitcher of their margheritas and all drinks were made strong and definitely worth getting.Even though some reviewers have noted that this place is pricey, I really don't think it is considering the location and the environment. I thought items such as the tacos and the chicken mole were pretty on par with most restaurants that are not located in touristy areas.Overall, we enjoyed our night at El Catrin immensely.

However, one of my friends had to take an urgent phone call, and stepped out for a few minutes and the server came over and started yelling at us for getting seated without our entire table ready.

We came here for Easter Sunday brunch had a great time!Wait time: Knowing full well the notorious wait time for brunch here we were mentally prepared to stand outside and brave the April rain/snow (welcome to Toronto). We saw a small line up out the door but went in to try our luck anyways. A very friendly staff greeted us right at the entrance and told us that the wait time was going to just over an hour (We got there around 12:35pm). To our pleasant surprise he was able to take our name and phone number so we can hang out somewhere else and get a text when our table was ready (every restaurant should do this!) so we can come back. He was very nice, and I did not feel rushed at all, another pleasant surprise given the restaurant's popularity. We hung out around liberty village market just a block away and got a text 50 minutes later.Parking: There is a huge green P parking lot that has the new mobile pay function right across the street from the restaurant, super convenient and hard to come by if this was right in downtown. Parking is $3 for an hour.FOOD: Everything other reviewers have said. I really liked the fact that the menu was small so making a choice is (relatively) easy. I got the special pink lemonade, smoked salmon breakfast salad, my boyfriend got cheesy french toast, and hash brown with jalapeno and sour cream to share. My salad was very fresh, crunchy, and refreshing, with just the perfect amount of dressing. The fingerling potato I thought was a bit on the bland side when eaten alone, but if you eat it with the smoked salmon it would be perfect. There is a perfectly cooked sunny side up egg on top of the salad and though it may seem like a strange combination, it all works really well. The salad is actually bigger than I expected as I walked out absolutely stuffed. I had a bite of the cheesy toast and yup, every bit as delicous as other reviewers have said. The bacon is cooked just right, not too crunchy, and a little bit sweet fromt he maple syrup that was served alongside the dish. You can still taste the smokey pork flavour which I think should be the new golden standard for bacon :)Service: Very friendly, very geniune, not pretentious or snobby AT ALL. The staff made me feel very comfortable, not rushed at all (even though people were constantly lining up all the way to the entrance). They checked up on us just the right amount without being intrusive or pushy and I saw that they all gave the same amount of care to every other customer which I think is amazing.Price: average $30 a person if you are getting a drink with your order, I thought it was very fair given the experience. Not exactly a bargain but I definitely didn't feel like I was ripped off, especially given the fact that parking was convenient, inexpensive, and the wait time wasn't terrible.Would I come back again? 100%.

My family has agreed that outside of Italy, Libretto is the best we have ever had (and as a family of pizza-lovers, we have had pizza at many places). It is prepared in the traditional Napoletana-style, seen in the goodness that is the chewy, soft, blistery crusts. Service is friendly and fast as well. I've tried nearly every pizza on the menu (save sausage, anchovie, and salami) at one point or another, and they were consistent in their taste and quality. I am a bit of a traditionalist in the sense that I like a pizza with tomato sauce and melted cheese of some sort, rather than one grated on after the pizza has been cooked. The Nduja sausage and margherita are best for fans of that. The white mushroom pizza is delicious as well. Really, all the pizzas are good. There is something for everyone and the waiters are accomodating with omitting certain ingredients, if you prefer. Not only are the pizzas great, but the appetizer menu is well rounded and perfectly proportioned. The warm olives are a great start to any meal. As for desserts, you can't make many mistakes here. My favourite is the Sfingi. If you like warm, pillowy donuts (and who doesn't?) these are amazing. They've got a beautiful golden crust and when i went were topped with cinnamon sugar and had a nutella filling (it might've been drizzle, I don't quite remember).

The soft whipped cream cheese, refreshing cucumber and slightly bitter (and aromatic) dill really enhanced the flavor of the cured trout when eaten in one bite!-Soup of Sweet Corn: The sweet corn soup is a little bit thin for my liking, as I'm used to the Asian style of a thick and silky soup texture. With that said, because of the thin texture, the soup wasn't too filling and perfect as an appetizer! The flavors of the soup was amazing. It was not too sweet as the lime balanced out the sweetness of the corn and coconut milk, and the chili lent a subtile hint of spice. -Coffee Smoked Baby Back Ribs: It wasn't my favourite. Normally I don't like coffee in the marinade as it accentuates the bitter and smoky flavors of the rib.

It was good but not great either. I think it would have been better if the earl grey tea flavor was stronger in the cake, but I love anything with earl grey so maybe that's just me.-'Sugar Plum':  Again the Sugar Plum dessert was okay and for me it was a nice way to end the meal after having the heavy main course.

Not the best first impression and will probably not be back.  My experiences at Khao San Road have been far superior in food and service.---I've been meaning to try Pai for a long time now since it received so much hype a few months ago. The vibe and food from the restaurant reminds me a lot of Khao San Road with slight differences.  I came here on a Sunday night at 6:30pm for a group of 4 and we did make reservations 3 weeks in advance!  The restaurant is easy to spot on Duncan St. but there's limited parking on the actual street.  You may find better luck parking on the side streets of Richmond or Adelaide or King... but if you're up for a further walk, there is actually free parking just north of Queen.  The restaurant itself is bigger than I imagined.  It fits probably 50 people (with reasonable space between the tables) in the dining area and along the bar.  It is in the basement of a building though and there is patio seating.  It's pretty loud inside (throughout the entire meal) but that's to be expected.   Our order:Thai Iced Tea - Very sweet but very flavorful.  I would recommend asking for less sugar or waiting for the ice to melt.   Gai Satay - Pretty much just a few chicken pieces on a skewer.  Was not impressed... food came out cold and the peanut sauce is just mediocre.  For 4 people, it's a skewer per person but also $3/skewer!  Sai Ua Platter - Probably my biggest complaint and let-down for the night.  This dish came out cold as well and AFTER our entrees! Our waiter didn't seem that knowledgeable when we asked her what it was and we still had no idea how to eat it when it came.  I wish they explained how we were supposed to enjoy it properly since it came in parts.Khao Soi - My favorite from Khao San Road and definitely not my favorite from Pai.  It was small, very few noodles but a lot of sauce/curry and other stuff but not enough meat.  Disappointed.  Also came out cold...Gaeng Kiaw Wan - The curry itself was flavorful but a little more viscous than I would've liked.  Not enough rice to soak up all the curry (or to share).  The presentation was cool though and we attempted to eat the coconut meat with little success - I think they hollowed it out already.My impression of Pai was average at best for the food portion and I would leave it at that if not for the service we received.  My biggest complaint from the evening came from our COLD food and our waitress' lack of attention.  We ordered two apps and one came AFTER our entrees were already done and someone removed our plates/cutlery.  We asked time and time again but the waitress would just return and say Did you get it yet?.  When we did get our order, we were already upset that it was also cold and we didn't know how to eat it (waitress clearly didn't either).  Needless to say, we didn't leave very satisfied or terribly full. The food portions are relatively small in general so I wouldn't recommend sharing entrees.For the entire meal, we paid almost $80 total before tip (about $20/person) and that's on the high side for Thai food in my opinion.  We sat there for probably 45 mins longer than we should've  just because our app was late.  Even though their menus may be similar, the service and food aren't up to the standard I'm used to at Khao San Road.  After the meal, I posted my disappointment on IG and the owner of Pai actually responded! They apologized and offered me a free entrée if I ever visited the restaurant again.  I appreciate the owner being reactive to my comments, but they should've been more proactive while we were there.  The waitress (and busboys and other wait staff) knew that we were upset so there's no reason why they couldn't have said anything while we were dining; that would've been a more impactful apology. Anyway, for that follow-up, I give them one more star than I think they deserved, but I will still probably not go to Pai again.  I don't live downtown and the journey to venture there is more of a hassle than it's worth. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(4094, 4108)",2,0.0,False

I love seeing him in the middle of the day.We went to the very popular Banh Mi Boys for a quick vietnamese sub lunch (I love my viet sub, especially those available at asian supermarkets)! Banh Mi Boys is famous for its fusion vietnamese sandwiches and we really wanted to see what kind of magic Banh Mi Boys has to offer!  Arriving around 12:30, the restaurant was packed with people lining up to buy food. It took us awhile to find a seat, order the food and wait for them to be ready.We ordered the Kimchi Fries. At first, I was a bit skeptical about how the Kimchi would go with fries, especially when neither of us really like Kimchi b/c of its taste and spiciness.  However, I am surprised to say that they went together like peanut better and jam! I believe that the Kimchi was a modified version; hence, it was not crazy spicy with a reduced taste of the ordinary strong  Kimchi flavour. When mixed with the mayo, it became a very creamy sauce with a hint of kimchi that went harmoniously with the fries! Love it! Also, the fries came with pulled pork which added another dimension of flavour. In our opinion, there were too much pulled pork and we could not finish all of them.Next, we had the braised beef cheek steamed bao. The bun was really really soft, softer than the cha shu bao available at dim sum places. It felt really good at first, both in the hand and in the mouth. However, it was too soft that it quickly absorbed the sauce of the beef cheek and became very soggy. The bun was sort of unbearable when we were half way through... Nevertheless, the beef cheek was flavourful and tender.A trip to Banh Mi boys is not completed without trying their Banh Mi! So We ordered their Five Spice Pork Belly Banh Mi. Unlike the vietnamese sub I always have where the bread is severed cold, Banh Mi Boys' baguette was slightly toasted which I actually like more! The crispiness of the bun echoed with the crispiness of the picked carrots. Pickled carrots is one of the reason why I love viet sub so much and Banh Mi Boys did it just right.  Moreover, they added japanese picked cucumber into their Banh Mi which was a good twist to traditional vietnamese sub. But I think it overpowered the pickled carrots.  On the other hand, JW really liked the pork belly which was very tender because of their generous amount of fat.conclusion: not roasted. Although this conclusion may surprise most of you, I believe that Nguyen Huong vietnamese sandwiches are actually better like I mentioned in this post. I might return to Banh Mi Boys for their kimchi fries but it will not be my first choice for vietnamese sub. However, Banh Mi Boys is still a great alternatives for those who normally have ordinary sandwiches for lunch in downtown!visit http://theroastedacorn.com/2013/02/05/banh-mi-boys/ for awesome pictures of the food i mentioned :) ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2893, 2907)",1,0.0,False

We tried to get past this awkwardness and ordered two round of food with drinks, and were ready to order our dessert when the waitress informed us that this was last call. My boyfriend and I looked at each other, completely baffled. I asked, As in OUR last call? We had only been there an hour and 15 minutes...and they were essentially telling us to hurry up and get out. My boyfriend was so upset he could hardly speak, so I ordered dessert and plum wine for us. Dessert and drinks were of course awesome. The food here is amazing. But I have never been so embarrassed in my life. After we paid the bill (we still got out of there with 20 minutes left on our 2 hour time limit) and left, my boyfriend asked, Are we riffraff?

The menu is expensive but if you consider normal entrance to the CN Tower is $30+ you are basically paying regular prices for a fancy dinner. On to the dining experience.  We made reservations for 11am because we were leaving right after to head back to the states.  I'm not sure if it was because we were so early, but the waiters and staff were very robot-like and did not really make you feel comfortable.  Not sure if that's the case all the time or maybe because it was just early.  I'm not saying the staff was mean but they just did not really have a personality. I ordered the Bison steak a la carte and asparagus.  The bison was recommended to be cooked medium rare, which wasn't a problem.  Bison tasted okay.  It was not anything unbelievable or I would crave again.  The asparagus was generic and served with a piece of butter on top. My girlfriend ordered the 2 course meal.  She had a Caesar salad with bacon.  The salad came with a drizzle of dressing and a couple nice big chunks of bacon.  She loved the bacon but the salad was too plain for her because of the lack of dressing.  The waiter recommended she try the arugula ricotta agnolotti.  It basically looked like a pirogi shaped noodle stuffed with arugula ricotta.  It tasted very bitter and she did not like it at all.  She took half a bite and left the rest.  The waiter came around and we told him that she did not really like it and she ordered a side of fries lol.  The waiter did not really make any attempts to try to fix the situation and maybe offer her half off the entree or a free dessert.  I should add I tried a piece of the dish and it really was very bland and bitter.  Nothing I would enjoys. Overall it is something someone should experience but the food is not anything amazing.

I do not recommend coming in here with a group of people, unless you guys come in a time when people are busy (e.g. at work, etc). The menu was easy to read with a few photos showing how each of them look like. Of course, we decided to try the green tea crepe cake - a famous item on their list. The crepe cake was very small. I'd say approximately 7cm for the largest section and maybe 15cm in length for $8.50. Each crepe layer was extremely thin enriched with a thin layer of cream in between each of the layers - it was oh so delicious. Soft and delicate with approximately 20 layers, the cake squishes together as you cut into to. It was definitely expensive, but because of the amount of work they put into it, I think it was worth it.Another item we tried was the Japanese special crepe. The crepe was wrapped very nicely stuffed with chocolate (that I couldn't really taste) and strawberries all in the inside and topped with green tea ice cream and whipping cream all wrapped up in a roll. The mixture of flavours together was DELICIOUS. I don't know how it would taste if i ate it as a wrap though (I unfolded everything when I ate it), because if I ate it as a wrap, I would have to eat the entire ice cream and whipped cream before I get to the strawberry galore.

We got the $75 Prix-fixe. This choice is a step up from the first Prix-Fixe option which is $65 per person. The reason we went for the $75 Prix-Fixe was because we just liked the appetizer and main menu options better than the other one. They also serve you a small pre-appetizer dish, which so very small, but delicious nonetheless. We tried the Sesame Albacore Tuna and liked it a lot.

Well, the kind of party that involves food, that is.Before we begin, let me educate you on the pronunciation of this place - read Verst. And its exact English translation is non other than sausage (figures). This recently opened spot in the heart of King West has been successfully luring in lunch crowds. With its sausage hall concept, breadth of sausage styles and flavours and an impressive local and imported beer menu; Wvrst has quickly become a favourite in the area and the Friday lunch go-to place for most of us.Their dedication to the core product, sausages; its one to admire. All sausages are freshly made on the premises and cooked when ordered. When you arrive at Wvrst, you right away notice a large line up of people (mostly men...I did say it was a sausage party) staring at the menu, asking the staff for advice and at times drinking beer while waiting in line. Because this is a sausage hall, once your food is ordered, you are given a number which then lets the waiters know which table to bring the food to. One thing you will notice is that because the line-ups are long, the waiters are extremely diligent in cleaning up the tables, so don't feel like they are rushing you, they are just doing their job and are very pleasant.Now, lets talk about the product. From the list, my favourite is the Venison style sausage. Given that its flavour is more on the smokey, nutty and hearty side, it makes it a great pairing with just about any topping. You can choose 2 out of 4 toppings - Caramelized Onions, Sauerkraut, Sweet Peppers and Sautéed Jalapeños. The roll used to wrap these juicy meats around is something worth mentioning, being on the rather soft side, this roll is lightly sweet with a hint of sourdough style bread, a great choice. Note to reader: you can also order a whole wheat roll and choice of veggie or chicken sausage options.Another one of Wvrst's hits is their Duck Fat Fries. Fried in duck fat as opposed to regular oil, the fries tend to be softer and buttery, while maintaining a great consistency on the surface. How this is done? A two step frying process. Double-dipping is what I would name this frying method. The outcome? Buttery and flavourful french fries. But the goodness does not end here, on top of having great tasting fries, Wvrst offers you a selection of dipping sauces. My favourite, and one that I can not live without, the Mojito sauce. Dip your fries in it or add it to your sausage party, either way you in are in for a heck of a tasty treat.Until next time Foodies!Buen Provecho,Viviana.

We had a reservation and were seated right away.The menu is a little confusing so we just ordered based on how many pieces were in the lunch. We all got the premium sushi lunch (with 12 pieces) and had a calamari plate to share. The calamari was delicious- it involved more than just the regular panko crust that you get in every sushi restaurant in Toronto. There was some green seasoning in it and the crust felt more substantial. It came with Brussels sprouts (which were great) as well as a squid ink sauce which really punched up the flavour. The premium sushi was great as well. It was presented very well and it's the stuff that involves tweezers in the kitchen. I would say that Miku is more fusion- it's definitely not sushi for the purist. But that's what made it special and the flavours were all very well-balanced and the fish was fresh. All in all it was a great dining experience but I would still say it's a little overpriced. ANSWERNOTFOUND,ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(971, 985)",1,0.0,False

Khao San Road's chef doesn't hold back on Thai spices and garlic which allows their dishes to be bursting with Thai flavor. Salad King's dishes are much more toned down and compared to Khao San Road, it could seem a little bland in terms of flavor. Because of the spices, Khao San Road's dishes feels heavy whereas Salad King's dishes seem lighter (if that makes any sense). It's really a personal preferance as to if you prefer Khao San Road or Salad King.Summary: Khao San Road focuses on staying true to Thai flavors, so be aware and get ready to taste some garlic if you've only tried food court Thai food.

This is my second time coming here since a few years ago when I was in shock after seeing a cockroach on the wall, but my coworkers all decided to come for a quick bite, so why not give them another chance.. For almost $15 after tax, Aji Sai's AYCE menu does not offer any sashimi, but instead plenty of cooked food. The roll selection was decent but none of them had a description explaining what the heck a Fireman Roll is.. Our server, Shirley, had the worst attitude. Her face was made of rock, and gave us a look of disdain when we asked for the menu again. Our dishes were pretty much 'thrown' at us.. and when it came time to pay, they were even more annoyed that we needed to get separate bills. She also tried to charge us $1 for every two pieces of sushi we couldn't finish. I was upfront and told her that the fish did not taste fresh and that none of us could eat that roll and she still insists that it's company policy. I was super frustrated at this point because the food was horrible and the service was even worse.. Don't order the following:1. Wakame Salad - The seaweed is extremely dried out. You'll think you're eating grass.2. Saury - This fish was so burnt & bitter I had to spit it out. It tasted like cancer, with the scales and a million tiny fish bones. 3. Fried tofu - You'd think this was crispy since it's fried, but NOPE it's soggy like wet socks and very bland to the taste. 4. Fish cake - Equally as soggy as the fried tofu, but has a distinguished fishy smell. I think the fish paste needed to be cooked longer. 5. Any roll that has tempura bits in it - the roll will be 80% tempura bits. To sum up my experience here: 1. Horrible Service - Don't come here and get stressed out by these extremely rude servers. 2. Horrible Food - Even for lunch AYCE, don't waste $15 on this..3. Never coming back. I'm sure cockroaches still live here. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1995, 2009)",1,0.0,False

It did seem more intimate / more suitable for one on one dining and drinks, I did not see many groups of friends at a table. My first experience with Insomnia was through food delivery. I wanted to come in and experience the full package so my boyfriend and I had reservations for a Saturday night. We were greeted and seated immediately, right by the windows facing Bloor st. The restaurant was dim and romantic, but the street lights coming in added a nice touch to the ambience.Our server, Raza (not sure how to spell her name, sorry!!), was very friendly and informative. We ordered everything she recommended and we loved every dish. She also mentioned how their Old Fashioned is more traditional, and how they have a regular who comes in exclusively for the old fashioneds. I've had my fair share of Old Fashioneds and this is one of my favourites (they use 1 big square cube of ice rather than regular ice cubes!).To start we ordered the mussels, and Raza recommended we get their complimentary bread to dip. The bread isnt listed on the menu with the dish as the mussels are noted gluten free, but it is a very highly recommended option! The mussels were soo good, and didn't have any grimey seafood scents or flavour. The sauce the mussels were soaked in was creamy, but not overly rich. We also tried the calamari, and it was good, but the mussels were my favourite out of the two.For our entree, my boyfriend was debating between chicken and waffles or their spicy penne. Our server mentioned the owner of Insomnia is also the co-owner of Dirty Bird, so the chicken and waffles are the same recipe. He immediately chose the chicken and waffles. I heard Insomnia is known for their signature Insomnia burgers, but I was in the mood for pasta. Raza said the rose sauce shrimp linguine was her favourite, so I went with that. I highly recommend the shrimp linguine with rose sauce, especially if you're hungry. The portion was huge, and I really wanted to keep eating it but I couldn't finish. I got a second drink after my old fashioned, called Smoking Gun. It wasnt too sweet, nor tasted overwhelmingly of bourbon. It was a luxurious orange chocolate cocktail with an even better aftertaste, and I love how they fill the beverage up to its rims!I would say Insomnia is the perfect date night spot, or a great place to enjoy a cocktail or two (they also have a long list of intricate cocktails + the usual beer and wine) catching up with your friends.

The only reason it wasn't a 5-star was because the service was quite terrible and could've brought the score down more if it wasn't for the food.Staff: We were informed by our server that it was a small plates style similar to Spanish tapas. Given that we were a party of five it made it an excellent chance for us to experience the dishes. However, we had tried to order the dishes based on the recommendation of a small for each of us (so five smalls), a rice dish, plus two larges. However each time we chose the dishes we were gently informed that the large dishes we chose were quite tiny so we should rethink our order and would walk away telling us to ponder with our own thoughts. This caused for confusion amongst us because we had changed it up 3 times before we had ordered enough food that the server felt was enough, which ended up being 4 smalls dishes, a rice dish, and 4 large dishes. I almost wish that they wouldn't have suggested otherwise in the first place and made us doubt ourselves multiple times. The food came at a reasonable pace, but everything always felt hindered by the service. At one point we asked for dessert menus and it took nearly 20 minutes and a second reminder before we got the menu. It seemed that they were well aware we wanted the menu but felt that they needed to (slowly!) clear the dishes before we're given the menu. This whole meal took 3 hours because of the service.Ambience: It is a nice clean environment with comfortable seating. The place is dimly lit which was okay but as the sun was setting, it definitely got dimmer. It definitely had a Mediterranean feel when it came to the restaurant and the plates and utensils. It was nice seeing them prepare some of our food and drinks, as some of the prep is visible to the diners. Overall, great setting!Food: To keep this from being longer than it already is, I'm just going to put in one line comments on each dish we ordered. Roasted Red Beets: nice yogurt, soft and juicy beets, excellent dish. Duck Kibbeh: I'm a huge fan now, with the great spices and flavours. Hamachi: I didn't care for it, but at least it tasted fresh. Lamb Ribs: a huge hit with everyone but I can't really comment since I didn't eat it. Chargrilled Cornish Hen: Excellent flavours, so juicy and causing my mouth to water just thinking about it again. Whole Boneless Branzino: It was okay, but nothing memorable to me in terms of flavour. Fried Chicken: I loved it, it was crispy and flavourful and reminded me of southern fried chicken. Yogurt Baked Fluke: I was most looking forward to this dish, but it relied heavily on the yogurt for flavour rather than the fluke. For dessert we had the Pavlova which I found was very tart for me, the Crispy Qatayef which had a strong floral aroma but tasty nonetheless, and the Loukoumades which was alright but the burnt honey ice cream was amazing!I don't know if it was our server, but it seems like other reviews had a much better service than me, so maybe I'll come back soon, especially for the food.

I reviewed the Levetto website carefully, and I couldn't find any information about whether they took reservations or not - many restaurants will note that you can't make reservations or they tell you what you need to do to make a reservation. So what I did was send Aly MacGregor an email (she is in charge or press and media inquiries) and she arranged a reservation for myself and my friends. Aly not only addressed all my questions, and reservation changes (a very patient lady she is), she made sure to follow-up on our experience the day after our reservation. One highlight of my communication with Aly was when I asked about gluten-free options for my friend Karen who really wanted to join us for dinner (Levetto does not have gluten-free options on their menu), and she spoke to Chef Shahir Massoud (Corporate Executive Chef for Levetto) about my query, and Levetto agreed to look into this for us.The day before our reservation, I received a Twitter message that read, Look Itanni! Gluten-free pasta! And there was an image of Chef Shahir making fresh gluten-free pasta. How incredible is that?!  So I immediately contacted Karen, and she was thrilled for the opportunity to join us and not have to stick to salads.On the evening of our reservation I strolled in ON TIME, and as usual my guests were already there, seated. Argh Once I greeted everyone I went to look for Chef Shahir to thank him for what he had done for Karen.  I was relieved to see that Chef Shahir was there this evening (they had recently opened the College location, so it was very likely that he would be at the College location). When I introduced myself and thanked him for the reservation and the gluten-free pasta, he flipped it around and said, no THANK YOU! We are so excited to have you and your friends join us. I wanted to be here to meet you all. Aly really wanted to come as well but there was a scheduling conflict. Awww! It often shocks me when a restaurant that is doing so well, can be so humble. But then it is because of restaurants and service like the one we received at Levetto that will keep from returning to a restaurant that has amazing food, and a self-righteous attitude.The MenuThe menu is split into 5 sections:Pasta ($8-$13)Pizza - they come in three sizes: personal (4 pieces), medium (6 pieces), large (guessing 8 pieces) and the prices range from $6.50-$31Salad ($8-$9)SpecialsDesserts ($6)Every single one of my guests were blown away by the food. It was not only delicious, but the ingredients were fresh, the pasta was made from scratch, great portions, and there was definitely value for money. We also lucked out in the dessert department. If you check-in to Yelp, you get a free dessert, so we all got a different dessert so we could share and try all three. My personal favorite was the Tiramisu, followed closely by the Warm Brown Butter & Coconut Semolina Cake that was served steaming hot, and then the Panna Cotta. But really, it comes down to your taste preference: if you like rich go with the cake, if you like creamy go with the tiramisu, if you like tart and not-so-sweet desserts, then go with the panna cotta.After dinner Chef Shahir made sure to check-in with every guest, and shared with us how he became a chef and some stories from his time in New York. I told him that I was flying to Italy the following week, and that when I returned I would teach him a thing or two about Italian food. ;)Thank you to the team at Levetto and Aly for making this wonderful evening happen for us. Since this dinner, almost all my friends have returned, and at least 4 are now regulars. Now I am dying to see how the College location is doing. I hope it's just as good as the Liberty Village location since the College location is closer to where I live.See you soon Levetto!xoP.S. Karen wanted me to tell you that Chef Shahir packed up the left over pasta for her to take home. She told me that she had enough fresh pasta for a week, and it was delicious (chef Shahir taught her how to keep it fresh at home). ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(4179, 4193)",5,0.0,False

This is a must order every single time, each time I've ordered it there's obviously a bit of variance in taste and texture (sometimes even the temperature), but it has never been less than very good.The scallop sashimi here seems different from every other place I've been to in Toronto. It's as fresh as frozen? sashimi can get, to be honest I couldn't tell at all whether or not it was frozen. It's a very refreshing dish with a naturally sweet scent that goes perfectly with the soy sauce and a bit of wasabi. Ordered this every time, it has only tasted less than perfection once (slightly slimy once). The chorizo octopus appetizer.. Oh my god I wish literally any other restaurant could make this and have it cheaper because then I would go to said restaurant all the time. The most tender octopus I've had in my life with a unique sauce on the side paired with some diced chorizo sausages.

Obviously, eating atop a giant tower in a revolving restaurant will inflate food and drink prices a bit.  There are two- and three-course meal options available and a la carte selections.  The meal options are a way better deal because you get similar (or the same) entree with additional food.  The three-course menu was $79CAD per person (about $60US per person).  Drinks were $5-$10US, so typical of a restaurant/bar.  Some of the cocktails were a bit pricier but also fancier so you get what you pay for.  I enjoyed my soup (yellow tomato and corn gazpacho) and baked ziti with wild mushrooms.  There weren't a ton of mushrooms in the entree, but the ziti and chili sauce were delicious.  My husband got the aged ribeye entree and really enjoyed it.  It was a little too rare (even though he ordered medium rare) so maybe make sure they cook it medium throughout and not just one section of the cut.  Since they served bread before the meal, I filled up on a bit too much of that (there was some waiting between app and entree) so I almost couldn't finish my dessert.  I had the sorbet which was delicious and my husband had ice cream and cookies, which he loved.  The homemade fig newton was yummo.   Obviously, the view is excellent.  It takes 72 minutes for the restaurant to make one full rotation and they seem to have dinner timed pretty well to coincide with that revolution.  We basically ended where we started (a little later) so we were only up there for like 90 minutes.

Disappointing given the reason we had gone was to taste their various beers.The food was average.  Burgers were large, fris served on the side (in their own cup) with garlic aioli. It might have been good - but none of us tasted it as it had that crusty film on the top that condiments get when sitting out for too long.

Getting refills of water, napkins or anything really once the food was served was impossible.  Seeing this wasnt going to be somewhere to stay and drink for the evening we asked for the bill.  I will say they were great to give us seperate bills. the downfall is that their terminals for credit and debit dont work on the patio (something about the brick walls of the restaurant block service).

We also ordered a separate plate of fried vermicelli. I was very excited when the lobster came as a lobster MOUNTAIN (I wasn't expecting it since they had a separate menu section for lobster mountains). There was a lot of meat that and was easily removable from the shell, very fresh, and a good balance between spicy and sweet tones! My favourite dish was the lobster roe fried rice! It had a lot of roe, was uniquely flavourful, and the rice was not sticking to one another. The greens was also delicious, and its simplicity was much needed in contrast to the lobster and fried rice. The vermicelli was pretty plain but of good quality. The black sesame dessert at the end was also very light and smooth!The waiters were all quite attentive and helpful. They explained to us different menu items and how they were priced. Food was served all together and very quickly after ordering. They offered to change plates every once in a while when they were getting filled with lobster shell.

The waiter and kitchen were extremely accommodating as one individual of our group was celiac (gluten-free) and the other being pescetarian (vegetarian + fish). They were able to swap items in and out of the tasting menu to accommodate what they desired and needed. They even served gluten-free bread for the one member of the party and reassured her that each dish was gluten-free. The décor was quite nice and gives you a feel that you're in a remote cottage somewhere. They even had a fireplace burning near the front of the restaurant which scented all our coats in the coat room also located at the front... for better or for worse. Food - I found to the food to be hit and miss. For some of the items in tasting menu, I found it to be a bit bland and required more seasoning. A good example would be the Pomme de Terre - while the lobster was very well cooked, there was a lack of cream and seasoning which made the potatoes dry and tasteless. However, the dish that stood out for me and that was the cod, mussel and shrimp dumpling in a consommé (dish may change with the season). The fish was perfectly cooked and all the items on the plate were propped up with carrots to prevent them from getting soggy in the consommé - very well thought out and well executed dish. As they were in season, we had white truffle added to some of our dishes. They were fragrant and added another dimension to the dish. Not many restaurants in Toronto offer white truffles during the holiday season, so this was a very nice addition. I think the desserts are an area of opportunity for the restaurant. The donuts that came with the tasting menu were good, but were not too sophisticated or inspired. I also got the soufflé which was a tad undercooked.  Price - as with any fine dining restaurant, prepare your wallet. We went a little overboard with the wine and white truffles, so that shouldn't be a representation of a normal dinner at Auberge. If you are a little more cost conservative, wait for winter/summerlicious to try out the restaurant's offerings.

Another tip: if you come Sunday evening, which is unfortunately my favourite time to stop by, it's luck of the draw if you want to try the seasonal adventure beers like the delicious Oranje Weiss, as they tend to run out.So listen, it's a brewpub, meaning that you can't go in there expecting the food to be white glove level exquisite, BUT they do have some truly interesting selections.

The server was nice, but she wasn't too great with the little details, such as refilling our water. On top of that, my boyfriend and my friend told me that they had to ask her twice to write Happy Birthday onto the dessert that we ordered (and had to order more desserts for her to get the second chance to write that for them) because she forgot to do so the first time.  On top of that, they take a fairly long time to prepare the food, even though we made sure to order our paella first because it usually takes a while.The three of us shared a few appetizers: croquetas de manchego, datiles con tocino iberico, and the patatas braves con huevos fritos. They were not bad, but definitely nothing extraordinary. I didn't like the patatas braves con huevos fritos too much, was hard and bland in my opinion. The paella patria was dry and a bit too salty for us, and all of us felt that the mussels tasted questionable - a bit too fishy in general. For dessert, we ordered flores con miel and the fried milk with the saffron ice cream, which was just meh, but the flores con miel was so delicious that we just had to order another one. That dish definitely saved our experience, I will go back again just to get that.In the end, our meal costed about $45 a person, and I can think of many other places I can go to with that budget, that have much tastier food than Patria.

Well, the kind of party that involves food, that is.Before we begin, let me educate you on the pronunciation of this place - read Verst. And its exact English translation is non other than sausage (figures). This recently opened spot in the heart of King West has been successfully luring in lunch crowds. With its sausage hall concept, breadth of sausage styles and flavours and an impressive local and imported beer menu; Wvrst has quickly become a favourite in the area and the Friday lunch go-to place for most of us.Their dedication to the core product, sausages; its one to admire. All sausages are freshly made on the premises and cooked when ordered. When you arrive at Wvrst, you right away notice a large line up of people (mostly men...I did say it was a sausage party) staring at the menu, asking the staff for advice and at times drinking beer while waiting in line. Because this is a sausage hall, once your food is ordered, you are given a number which then lets the waiters know which table to bring the food to. One thing you will notice is that because the line-ups are long, the waiters are extremely diligent in cleaning up the tables, so don't feel like they are rushing you, they are just doing their job and are very pleasant.Now, lets talk about the product. From the list, my favourite is the Venison style sausage. Given that its flavour is more on the smokey, nutty and hearty side, it makes it a great pairing with just about any topping. You can choose 2 out of 4 toppings - Caramelized Onions, Sauerkraut, Sweet Peppers and Sautéed Jalapeños. The roll used to wrap these juicy meats around is something worth mentioning, being on the rather soft side, this roll is lightly sweet with a hint of sourdough style bread, a great choice. Note to reader: you can also order a whole wheat roll and choice of veggie or chicken sausage options.Another one of Wvrst's hits is their Duck Fat Fries. Fried in duck fat as opposed to regular oil, the fries tend to be softer and buttery, while maintaining a great consistency on the surface. How this is done? A two step frying process. Double-dipping is what I would name this frying method. The outcome? Buttery and flavourful french fries. But the goodness does not end here, on top of having great tasting fries, Wvrst offers you a selection of dipping sauces. My favourite, and one that I can not live without, the Mojito sauce. Dip your fries in it or add it to your sausage party, either way you in are in for a heck of a tasty treat.Until next time Foodies!Buen Provecho,Viviana.

Buca was exactly what I thought it would be.  A clean space with simple details. Special shout out to their light fixture, I loved it.  As those who reviewed before me pointed out, Buca used to be boiler house and you can still see that. It's very industrial with huge ceilings. It's actually basement level but they've opened it up so that a lot of light can shine through. The lunch menu was pretty extensive, and priced average for King West. I hear they vary their lunch menu, although there are few constants, such as the rosemary, garlic bread knots.Service was slow to start, but got stellar and stayed that way throughout our long lunch.  Olive Ascolane - fried olives stuffed with lamb sausage - crunchy, salty and tangy.Pizza, sadly, I don't remember what this was called, but it had smoked buffalo cheese, chilies, and the day's cured meats.  It was spicy, salty, and smoky. Bigoli - homemade pasta with duck egg and a duck ragù with mascarpone and basil.  OMG. I loved this dish. The portion is small, but lest we forget, we on King West.

I Googled it because I've never heard of such a thing, much less tasted such a thing. I had to know more. Their proper term is actinidia arguta, or hard kiwi. Apparently it is native to Korea (amongst other countries). They are really delicious, and I think I love them. It was a proper pannacotta. I can't tell you how many times I've ordered it at a restaurant and been served messed up pudding. This was creamy, delicately flavoured and delicious. The tart tasted exactly how it smelled - amazing.  Sweet gelati, maple syrup and pistachios added textures to the delicate tart and pumpkin filling.If I had to choose the best dish of the day, I would go with the bigoli and the pannacotta.  The bread knots are also well-known but I think I want to try the pig ears next time. Word of warning, Buca doesn't serve complimentary bread, which may be why people like the knots so much.

Each and every time I have gone I've been very impressed with the décor, ambience, and quality of food while service remained at par. After browsing many reviews online, it became quite evident that this is a chain that does not pride itself on service, especially the Queen St. location which has one of the worst service reps I have ever encountered.  Having said that, let's talk food. The majority of the antipastos are delicious. I always order the carpaccio di manzo, a dish I typically order when I eat out I-tal. The Frittura di Calamari is great as well, a lightly battered deep fried calamari complimented well with lemon.  If you are with a group I highly recommend ordering the Tagliere Mezzo e Mezzo, a selection of Italian/local meats and cheeses. On a few occasions I recall having prosciutto di parma, smoked prosciutto, hot calabrese salami, fontina, smoked scamorza, pecarino, and parm + more, I do believe these are constantly changing day to day. I have not tried a pasta dish at Terroni's that I didn't enjoy. They also carry traditional types of pasta which you don't find everywhere like: Orecchiette, papardelle, garganelli and tagliatelle.  Most of the pastas such as the delicious gnocci are handmade in house, I personally heart the Mezze Maniche al Ragu d'Anatra, a duck ragu with spinach, mascarpone and parm.  As for the pizza, it is truly a-ma-zing, they really do rival Pizzeria Libretto. Terroni's has at least 20 pizzas and really you can't go wrong, even with the basic Margherita or Marinara. This may be attributed to the fact that Terroni's imports and packs they're own tomatos, in addition to making house specialties such as the homemade spicy sausage.  My favourite, like many others is the Smendozzata pizza: Tomato, mozza, homemade spicy sausage, gorgonzola, and red onions. This pizza is one of my favourite meals, period. It must have to do with the combination of flavour such as the mozza and gorgonzola melting and fusing with the house sausage and caramelizing onions, omg.   Other notable pizzas are the Natalina: Tomato, mozza, roasted red peppers, hot calabrese salami, garlic and olives. C't Mang: White pizza w/ mozza, gorgonzola, fresh pears, speck (smoked prosciutto), walnuts and honey. Quattro Stagiono: Tomato, mozza,  prosciutto di Parma,  eggplant,  zucchini and olives. If you have space for desert, let it be known Terroni's boasts the most popular desert item I have ever come across in my life. I know some girls, including my g/f, who would give up everything for just one bite. The item is a flourless dark chocolate lava cake which is so good that Terroni's could probably stay open just selling that desert. All in all if you're looking for a stand out Italian dinner full of delicious apps, pastas, pizza and a to-die-for desert Terroni's is your spot.

It was always a combination of too expensive and too inconvenient that made it a faraway dream. But I took advantage of Winterlicious 2018 to finally give in. Ok. I get it now. I finally see the light.I was surprised to find out that Miku was as fusion-y as it was. You don't get a lot of quality Asian fusion places, especially ones that do sushi/sashimi with the same high standards as really good Japanese restaurants in the city. They've got an extensive alcohol list and unique cocktails for the adventurous. I got the non-alcoholic Ginger Basil Smash, which was a little sour, a little sweet, and very smashing indeed. Despite the higher end dinner price tag of $53, I still believe Miku is one of the best Winterlicious offers out there. Firstly, $53 for a QUALITY 3-course meal is pretty damn good. Don't believe me? Let's break it down: 1) Aburi Sampler Platter - (6 pcs, originally $18) - How special can torched sushi be? Apparently, really special when it comes to Miku. The flavour was stronger than any other Aburi sushi I've had. I contemplated getting more of the torched salmon at regular prices, but I was too full by the end. 2) Bacon Wrapped Beef Tenderloin and Pan Seared Foie Gras Rouge - Not from the regular menu, this was a piece of Winterlicious originality. Everything on the plate tasted amazing, even the brussel sprouts. I can say for certain though that my first bite into the foie gras was the best, most orgasmic bite of the entire meal. It's also pure fatty goose liver goodness so even though you only get 3 small medallions of beef tenderloin, everything together made me quite full. 3) Green Tea Opera - (originally $14.5) - I was more than happy to see their signature dessert on the menu. It's really something special. Rich green tea mousse with crunchy hazelnuts. Served with a tiny scoop of fragrant house-made green tea ice cream. My fiancé had the Japanese Tiramisu. Tasty, but we both agreed the opera was better. Given the prices of the appetizer and dessert, that puts the beef and foie gras dish at $20! Sometimes, you can't even get a liver pâté dish at that price, let alone a whole piece of foie gras. On top of that, everything was cooked and flavoured to perfection. The prices might be high, but I think the talent behind the cooking justifies it. Quality over quantity makes Miku my Winterlicious winner.

It is named after an actual road in Bangkok, Thailand and its name means milled rice referencing a time when the street was a major rice market.  Now it is a haven for backpackers and buzzing with nightlife - akin to Mongkok in Hong Kong.While the original chef, Nuit Regular (Sabai Sabai + Sukhothai) has since left, the food is still yummy.  While most Thai places offer up ketchupy versions of pad thai and curries so thick of coconut milk that you taste nothing else - you can taste the difference at Khao San Road.  We try to order our ingredients from Thailand whenever possible, says owner Monte Wan because slight nuances in the flavour of tamarind (Thai vs. local) makes a difference.   KSR wants to be as Thai as possible.The Thai iced tea is reminiscent of Vietnamese coffee and is a refreshing and delicious drink to quench summer thirst - if you can get past the sugar rush!  The drink is made of a blend of Thai spices and black tea with condensed milk.  Unfortunately it comes pre-mixed, so no fancy, customized orders à la Starbucks here.  Everyone gets the same.The garlic tofu is delicious.  I haven't tasted tofu like this anywhere else.  Incredibly smooth on the inside and breaded in a crispy garlic and kaffir lime coating with a sweet and tangy sauce.  If ever there were a vegetarian equivalent to chicken nuggets - this would be it.The fresh rolls here, again share similarities with Vietnamese cuisine.  But those on a low-carb diet will be happy about the absence of vermicelli noodles.  It's packed with carrots, lettuce, Thai basil, mint leaves and a housemade chicken sausage.  The tamarind sauce topped with peanuts is a welcome addition though the rolls are flavourful in their own right.Continuing on with the sweet and tangy with a bit of heat is the Tom Yam Soup, the Thai version of a hot and sour soup which has much more complex flavors from lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, galangal, lime juice, fish sauce, and crushed chili peppers.  I'd choose this over hot chocolate on a cold, winter's day.The squash fritters are starchy and sweet like sweet potato fries and is a great nosh.The crispy rice salad is not yet on the menu but will be coming soon to a table near you.  It is a cold rice salad that has the texture of delicious rice crusts that form at the bottom of Korean/Chinese clay pot rice (usually the best part).  It is sprinkled with thin slices of ginger which add heat and topped with scallions.Those who can't handle the heat had better stay away from the Kua Ging Pork; curried minced pork with kaffir lime + house made curry paste. The kicker are the peppercorns.  You definitely feel the burn!The Gaeng Kaew Wan (green curry) with shrimp gets its color from the green chillies and is topped with bamboo shoots, Thai basil + kaffir lime leaves.  As with all of the KSR curries, definitely opt for a bowl of white rice to sop up all the delicious flavors!An all-time crowd-favorite and one of my own personal favorites is the khao soi; egg noodles in a coconut milk enriched curry, garnished with crispy noodles, green onion, coriander + lime. The beef version is their signature, though you can opt for chicken as well.  I love the textural differences in the noodles.Two different kinds of pad thai are available; the street-style and KSR's chef's special topped with crushed peanuts, dried chili and freshly squeezed lime juice.  Khao San Road doesn't take reservations, though the food comes out pretty fast so the turnover is quick.  If you want to avoid waiting then I suggest going right when they open (which at lunch is 11:30am and 5pm for dinner).  While there are many restaurants in the city that adhere to this no reservations policy that are so overrated and totally not worth it - Khao San Road is worth the wait.*This meal was complimentary, all opinions expressed are my own* ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3994, 4008)",5,0.0,False

In the end though, the food is delicious and that should be what matters most!The vibe:-The space that the restaurant occupies is incredible. Huge ceilings, beautiful light fixtures and accent pieces, it's a really trendy vibe with plenty of room for bigger groups. Unfortunately, the vibe of much of the crowd was very corporate, understandable given its location, but they're not on my top 5 lists of crowds. The service was attentive, maybe even somewhat obtrusively so. I won't fault them for that though.The drinks:-An intriguing cocktail menu, I ordered the Smokin' Manhattan which had tobacco-infused Rye (basically steeped with a cigar), lovely velvety texture and cigar-like smokiness made it worth the $14. The beer menu was decent but lacking in the stouts or porters I would prefer in the Winter weather. The food:-Started the meal with the Fried Chicken Skins, which was a nice greasy nibble before starting an actual meal. Not sized as an appetizer but delicious nonetheless. I ordered the Octopus/Lobster gumbo and split a Hot Mess with a friend who ordered the Jerk Cornish Hen. Overall, the gumbo had good flavour, and while it was a small portion, there was ample octopus and lobster found within it. The Jerk Hen was nice though I prefer my Jamaican seasoning on the spicier side. The star of the meal was the Hot Mess, a diabolical combination of sweet potato, brisket, sour cream, and cheese curds. Delicious and the brisket had a great smoky flavour that made me wish that I had given the smokepit a shot (I've avoided going full-BBQ since a recent trip to Texas made everything pale in comparison). Ended the meal with a Cheddar Cheese ice cream sandwich. Quite peculiar, it was a cheddar cheese blended ice cream within two wafers topped with parmesan-like cheese. The smell was pretty intensely savoury but the taste was great. I think I liked it? My overall impression:-A trendy, pricey BBQ spot in a neighbourhood that caters to a corporate crowd. The food makes up for any pejorative aspects of those words. The portions are small and that is somewhat against the whole concept of Southern comfort food but it was nice not feeling completely filled to the brim for once.

For the bun, I opted for turkey/chicken sausage with sautéed jalapeños and caramelized onion. I modified my concoction into a hot dog by adding ketchup and grainy mustard. However, I wasn't overly impressed by the sausage. It had decent flavours, but the texture was too dry. The toppings were very tasty though, but I wanted more on my bun.  For the currywvrst, we chose spicy Italian with pork and chili flakes. For me, I preferred the sausage on a bun, and again I found the sausage here overly dry. It was served with two pieces of rye bread, which I didn't enjoy nearly as much as the bun. The overall texture was tough and chewy. In addition to the two sausage dishes, we also got a small order of plain fry Belgian-style fries with maple rosemary dip. The fries were actually my favouite part of the meal and the maple rosemary dip was quite addictive. That said, I think it is pretty hard to mess up fries too badly. Overall, I think WVRST didn't live up to the hype. I was intrigued by the sausage/beer hall concept, but I wasn't overly impressed by the gourmet sausages.

I tried most of their go-to dishes on the menu and I can confidently say if you don't mind the price tag, you should try as many dishes as possible because it's worth it! I was not a big fan of their famous Khao Soi or pad tai ( I mean they are still good but not mind blowing like what others said ) but I quite enjoyed everything else. Their green curry is not mind blowing as well but still have all the flavours that you look for when it comes to Thai curry My usual go to is pad gra prow with crispy pork. It's a fried rice dish with your choice of meat that's cooked with Thai basil serve with sunny side egg, cucumber and fish sauce. This dish has everything. There is tenderness of meat and crispness and juicy fat from crispy pork. Fish sauce brings all the flavours out and creamy runny egg York wraps all the flavours together. When you feel like it's little too much of fat, there is silky rice and crispy cucumber to balances out the dish. Perfect dish I'll like to have when I have a little cheat day.Chiang Mai Beef Noodle Soup is another favorite of mine. Braised beef is so tender it just falls apart in your mouth. There is good balance between creaminess of peanut butter, spice, sweetness and sourness of lime. It was little bit on the heavier side than other Chiang Mai beef noodle soup I tried. Still darn good. If you are not into heavy dishes, just go for beef salad or papaya salad. They are very refreshing but yet has lots of flavour and quite filling. I took one star off because up and down of service. It's 50% chance hostess and servers will be very rude and forgetful and 50% chance they will provide the acceptional service.

It was my first visit, and I was excited to try this place which I had heard wonderful things about. My review:Food tasted great but the portioning was way off. I had the beet salad which came with a generous helping of red beets, crème fraîche, fresh grated horseradish, watercress and candied hazelnuts. However, one of my family members is allergic to hazelnuts and did not notice that it was in the menu description when she ordered it as her appetizer. When we asked the waiter if there are in fact hazelnuts, he said he would check with the kitchen. He came back to tell us there are no hazelnuts, only walnuts in the salad. These were clearly not walnuts. The kitchen and staff really should know what allergenic ingredients are going into their dishes. Had we taken his word, she would have eaten the nuts and had a very serious allergic reaction. For the main, I had the short-rib which was deliciously smoky and charred to perfection. The meat was tender and seasoning was on point. The side of beans added a nice tangy sweetness that contrasted well with the savoury beef. Others at my table made the mistake of ordering the trout, which came in a laughable portion measuring about 4x6x0.5. While the skin was crispy and the meat itself was moist and flavourful, the portion really did not justify the $38 set meal price. It also came with just three thin slices of zucchini and a very small crab fritter, smaller than a timbit. If you order the fish, don't come hungry. Finally for dessert, I chose the sticky date pudding with vanilla ice cream. Topped with caramel sauce, it was all a bit too sweet for me, but the portion was generous, and the contrast between creamy cool vanilla bean ice cream paired well with the warm spiced cake. The ginger crumble on top added a nice texture contrast to a dish that was overall soft in texture. The banana tart had a pleasant chocolate cookie crust with just the right thickness, but otherwise was not memorable. The trifle lacked flavour. The restaurant itself is gorgeous. Decked out like an upscale western saloon, it sports dark wood and is decorated with hunting memorabilia. A nice place to hang around for drinks with friends.The service was hit and miss. Our main server was not as attentive with our table as he was with diners who ordered off the regular menu. It bothers me when restaurant staff treat you differently depending on whether you are taking part in Summerlicious or not. I think all paying customers deserve equal treatment. In contrast, the other servers who helped with our table were fantastic. Overall, my food was delicious and most of the service was great, but I am giving two stars because of the hazelnut situation, and because the portioning of the fish dish really did not justify the price.

You can definitely taste the fish sauce, which I love in Asian cuisines. It was definitely a cozy and super tasty dish. However, I was very disappointed in the service we received from our waitress, and am very displeased to say that the kitchen staff who brought out our food was far more helpful than our actual waitress. We were seated and were waiting for one friend, but we knew what they wanted, so we waited for our waitress to come around to at least order our drinks, but she didnt for 15 mins and we had to flag her down, which she did not seem happy about. My boyfriend had asked her what was on tap, and she rudely replied with What? along with a displeased look. After ordering our drinks, she went off when we wanted to order our food as well, so we gave her a few minutes to punch in orders, tend other tables. We ended up waiting another 10 minutes and had to flag her down again, still seemed unhappy with asking her to take our order. When my friend had noted that he had a peanut allergy and asked if there was any nuts in his dishes, she once again seemed displeased to be asked a question. It took about 20 minutes to receive our food, and some of it was cold, where as the table behind us who had sat down and order after us began receiving their food within 5 minutes of ordering. Not even once during our meal did she ask if our meal was okay or if we wanted more water, we actually had to ask a different staff member to help us out. Another thing I kind of found work inappropriate was what one of the servers was wearing (btw I am in no way shaming this server or have any problems with what she was wearing but in no way do I or many others find it workplace appropriate in a restaurant for families...) but she was wearing a VERY sheer top, without anything under and you could clearly see her nipples, mind you I'm ok with that, but I'm not so sure families with younger children would be okay with that. In the end, we received our bill from our waitress, who yet once again seemed so annoyed with us, we saw that we had a 20% service charge. I'm okay with paying a service charge, since we did have 6 people, but I don't really think that our server deserved the 20% since her coworkers were waiting our table for her. Overall, the food is pretty good, a little bit on the pricier side for the portion you receive but the quality is there, but I don't mind as there aren't many good Thai restaurants in Toronto. i loved the atmosphere and vibe they had going on.

We had multiple servers and when we would attempt to ask one to come to the table for service, we were told that another server would come around. Furthermore, the tables are so close together it feels like you're invading your neighbours' party!Our meals consisted of: The Verde salad which was overdressed and a tad soggy, the Margherita pizza (which we asked to be sliced for the birthday girl, but apparently slicing it ruins the authenticity), the Salmon which was actually quite a good portion with a salad on the side, and the Tagliatelle alla Bolognese which was thoroughly enjoyed! We were not offered any daily food or drink specials. There were a few dietary concerns from guests and when the server was asked to clarify whether these would be a part of the meal, she did not return. In fact, the meal was presented to the guest before even making us aware of if the ingredient of concern would be included.Additionally, there were significant delays after we were finished with dinner and asked for the dessert menu; and when she finally arrived to take our order, we had been waiting for an additional 30 mins after completing the meal. Furthermore, when the dessert finally arrived for our birthday girl with a lit candle, it wasn't the dessert she ordered!Overall, the experience was 'pleasant' and our birthday girl enjoyed her night, which was the most important thing! I wish that I could say that my dining experiences at the other locations have been better, but the issues of inattentive service, little changes in the menu or consideration of dietary concerns has been consistent.I can't say that I would be eager to return.

But trust me, it's true.When a good friend recommended this place to me and insisted on treating me to a Blaze Pizza, I was immediately skeptical.  I have a pretty strong theory that you can only have 2 out of 3 things from any dining establishment located in close proximity to Dundas Square: 1) Quality  2) Affordability  3) Great customer service.  Well, colour me impressed - Blaze meets and exceeds all 3 criteria. Yes, you really *can* have your cake (or rather, pie) here and eat it too!  On my first visit, I was greeted by the friendliest staff that took the time to efficiently explain to me how Blaze works. A basic rundown: You can get a personal pie that is thin-crust, load it up with unlimited toppings (yes, unlimited! I basically had to pinch myself to make sure I wasn't dreaming) at a set price, and watch it get fast-fired in a large fire oven in 180-ish seconds.The Good: HUGE shout outs to Alca, who deserves a promotion and unlimited pizzas forever and more!  For me, Alca is the face of Blaze Pizza - she's been there every time I've visited (so, a lot), and every time, she greets each customer with patience, enthusiasm and a smile.  She gave me a great impression of the place from the start - it's so refreshing to see someone who genuinely enjoys their job, and Alca brings such warmth to Blaze with her welcoming, upbeat attitude and contagious laughter. She even remembers regulars' names, which, considering the amount of customers Blaze gets, must not be an easy feat!  Big thanks to Alca for being a role model for what every server in Toronto should be like.  When I say Blaze has great customer service, I have Alca in mind. :)  Definitely greet her with a smile the next time you see her - she's awesome!-They don't skimp on their topics. The unlimited toppings here are really high quality, and would usually add up to a lot in any other pizza joint.  From an assortment of fresh veggies and basic ingredients to things like pesto, artichokes, arugala (!), chopped garlic, and cloves of roasted garlic (my favourite), this place has almost everything and something for every palette.  -Blaze is really, really fast.  I sometimes stare in wonder and amazement at the guy blazin' up those pizzas. It's an art, and the man does it with such diligence - I've always had my pizzas from here come out fast, crisp, and perfectly toasted, never burnt or overdone or underdone. They've got it down to a science here!-Unlimited drink refills (which Alca was kind enough to tell me!)  I never thought lemonade could pair well with pizza, but I was wrong. It's a genius pairing.-*TIP*: You can get the best of both worlds if you can't decide between pesto or red sauce!  I like to go half-and-half. You can customize the pie any way you want, so you get to try (and enjoy) a bit of everything.-They have to-go boxes, and unlimited parmesan, hot pepper flakes, and oregano/basil (I can't remember which) on the side for you to grab and load up your pizza with when you sit down.-They also have take-out boxes on the side that you can grab if you choose to have your pizza indoors, and don't finish it! (In that case, though, what's wrong with you...just kidding. I think the whole accessible just-in-case take-out box concept is great and pretty innovative.)The Bad: Sometimes, it can get a little busy and seating can be limited (I've never experienced it personally, but my dad goes regularly during lunch rush hour and tells me this is the case.) My trick is, if you really want a seat and it's too packed at Blaze during lunchtime, take your pie up to the foodcourt in the adjacent building, the floor right below the movie theatres. Grab a drink or something from there, and enjoy. There's usually plenty of seating in the food court and it's just a one minute walk/elevator ride away.The Ugly: Nada.

Those just melt in your mouth and it was soooooo buttery and smooth. Another honourable mention is the sauce on the ocean trout nigiri which made it so damn good. There was a nigiri with a truffle sauce which was bomb af but I forgot which piece it was. Those were without a doubt phenomenal.

I had selected Tokusen Toroniku Ramen  pork jowl (cheek meat) and the signature salted broth, SHIO.  Service was quick and not long after I had a heaping bowl of noodles and a plate of the pork jowl. AnalysisPork Jowl - The meat melted in your mouth and was soft (supposed to be simmered).  It was delicious.Ramen - flavour and looks akin to egg noodles but with a thicker cut. Don't let it throw you off though it has more elasticity to it and makes it quire springy.Shio broth - Very rich, they use a similar method of Crossing-the-bridge noodles. They have thin layer of lard on top which reflects the heat back into the soup.  Don't let the lack of steam coming from the top trick you that the soup isn't hot.  The lard will also coat the food making it very smooth.  Things I can kind of identify inside the broth. sesame, miso (something akin to it), green onion, bamboo shoots (menma). fungi (cloud ear) and salt.

Firstly, one of my friends always raves about their coconut cream pie, and I wanted to see if it lived up to all that hype. And secondly, restaurant was running a $62 three-course Lobsterlicious special and I just can't seem to resist these prix fixe menus. Three types of bread were served, and I had one of each. One small complaint was that the butter was really hard to spread onto the bread.The bread basket was quickly followed by a complimentary amuse bouche: prosciutto with winter lettuce, toasted pine nuts, tarragon relish and Meyer lemon aioli. Everything tasted pretty good together, but it didn't wow me.Here are my picks for the Lobsterlicious menu:My choice of starter was the Dungeness crab ravioli with mustard greens, bok choy, radish and a uni butter sauce. The bok choy made the overall dish feel very Asian. The single raviolo was packed with crab meat, and the uni butter sauce was absolutely scrumptious. After demolishing everything else on the plate, I soaked up all the remaining sauce with bread. For my main, I opted for lobster gnocchi. Oddly enough, I loved everything in my lobster gnocchi that was not lobster- the snap peas, carrots, pearl onions, beet, and herb gnocchi! The vegetables were bright and vibrant, and I especially enjoyed the sweet beets. On top of that, the gnocchi was absolutely lovely, as light as a pillow. I also thought that the presentation was stunning with all the colourful veggies. My gnocchi was accompanied with a Parisienne lobster thermidor sauce, topped with toasted bread crumbs and gruyère cheese. On paper, this was everything that I should love- rich, cheesy lobster sauce topped with bread crumbs and cheese. Every spoonful contained large chunks of lobster meat. I couldn't believe that I could ever have too much lobster, but this was the case for me! Everything was so rich.For desserts, I went with the Araguani chocolate mousse with earl grey ice cream, lemon curd, honey tangerines and blood orange reduction. Clearly, I don't know my chocolate well, because Araguani is a 72% cocoa dark chocolate bar made by Valrhona, one of best chocolatiers in the world. I think the mousse was a misnomer, because it was more like a dark chocolate bar filled with chocolate mousse. As expected, it was too dark for my liking, although the earl grey ice cream was amazing!Here's what my bf ordered:Lobster bisque to start. The soup was topped with armagnac cream and chives. For me, the soup was intensely rich, and the armagnac on top of that was overwhelming. I was slightly put off by so much alcohol in the soup.8 oz filet mignon with porcini whipped potatoes, wild mushrooms, French green beans and Bordelaise sauce. I particularly loved the whipped potatoes, which packed an incredible punch of mushroom flavour. The steak was also executed very well. For desserts, he ordered Scaramouche's famous coconut cream pie with white chocolate shavings and dark chocolate sauce. This was like heaven in a slice of pie! Even though it was impossibly decadent and rich, I just couldn't stop taking more and more bites!

I liked the top sirloin and bacon wrapped filet mignon the best. Chimichurri was okay too.  The garlic cube and flank steak were a bit overcooked/bland. There is also a salad/cooked foods bar which I ate more of. I recommend: Spinach salad, mango salad, kale, broccoli, and mussels. Service was disappointing.  2/51. Servers carrying the meats came really fast.. I guess that's how they operate but i would feel rushed at times. 2. Servers carrying meats rarely smile, are rude, and impatient. They didn't give instruction whether I should use my tongs or if they would serve it directly to the plate, so they would just stand there looking impatient. 3. My friend was busy talking and one rudely interrupted Excuse Me to ask if she wanted the meat. 4. While cutting the meat, the piece fell on the table but he didn't say anything, leaving my friend to reluctantly pick it up from the table. When she asked for another piece, he shaved off a tiny, thin piece and quickly left the table. 5. My friend asked for ribs and the server said she would check. When my other friend checked up on the order, she said I know, he already asked me. We were then told it would take 15 mins to make, which ended up to be more like 30 mins. And when it arrived, it was not the same ribs he had earlier - this one tasted like brisket and had no bone; it was more like the inside of the meat without the crust.

The large selection is about the only good thing about this particular restaurant. Which isn't especially saying much since the large selection comes with the large prices, with most entrees looking to put you back $15-30.The service... I don't even know why they bother hiring the hostess (VERY loosely used term) upstairs because she's obviously there for show. The last two times I've entered through the upstairs entrance I had to wait for the hostesses (these were two different people by the way) to finish texting before telling me to walk downstairs and through the restaurant in order to have the downstairs hostess put my party on a list for a table.I can deal with that, just enter through the downstairs entrance through the Atrium, better service. Once in the basement though, which is sort of drab, dreary and just uncomfortable as fine dining atmospheres go, all the waiters I've had have been excellent.Now the food... All I can say is mediocre at best.Their calamari is decent as a large appetizer. Yet beware, their batter is incredibly rich and takes on a lot of oil (over-fried) so expect to feel some bloating.I personally had their eggs benedict today which was horrendous. If you want a benedict, go somewhere else (yes, even Golden Griddle who had a surprisingly good benedict last time I dropped by). Eggs were overcooked and didn't seem like they were freshly made, the bacon was obviously heatlamped, and the english muffin tasted stale. The only good point of the breakfast was the potato latke which was nothing like a latke and was more like a hashbrown, yet it tasted good, albeit a little salty. In the past I've had their a few of their steak and pasta items. I'd highly advise against the steak (dry, overcooked, tasteless), though the pasta is definitely passable.I saved the best for last. The dessert.I'd personally recommend the Killer Milkshake at $4. It's massive. You'll probably be able to find a better milkshake in town, but not one that size, and not one for that price.I know a lot of my friends love their brownies and cake, I haven't tried them though so YMMV.In closing, Pickle Barrels isn't a place I'd particularly recommend to go.

I cannot say the same thing about the personnel though, but as I always say, I will pretend is their first day on the job and they are trying to learn. I had a little bit of a wait till I could seat at the bar. I checked the drinks menu. Overpriced does not make any justice... it is WAY overpriced, compared to similar places in the area. They serve 3 and 5 oz glasses and the are priced as 6 and 9 oz respectively. Anyway, I took some 'decent' white wine and after that, some Tio Pepe Jerez which was very dry (the way I like it). I decided to go for tapas. Gambas al Ajillo and lamb meatballs to start with. As the name says it, Gambas al Ajillo (which means, garlic shrimp), has to be 'garlicky'. Well, not really. Just 3 pieces of shrimp sautéed in olive oil, two slices of garlic and a lot of parsley. Forgettable at the minimum. About the meatballs the only thing I have to say is, guys, the tomato sauce was fantastic. Tasted perfectly with that country style bread. Well, if the only good thing about the meatballs is the sauce, that tells you something. I later got the Ham Croquettes. Literally the best of the 3 tapas I got, but 3 small cylindrical pieces of 1 inch each at 10 bucks, is kind of aggressive. Bottom line, great place for a nice date or a small night out with friends.

We got the $75 Prix-fixe. This choice is a step up from the first Prix-Fixe option which is $65 per person.

They also serve you a small pre-appetizer dish, which so very small, but delicious nonetheless. We tried the Sesame Albacore Tuna and liked it a lot. For the appetizer, I got the clam chowder and my girlfriend tried the smoked salmon appetizer, both were good. For main, we both got sirloin steak, I got mine medium, and she got hers medium well. The steaks were both seasoned very well and very good , mine was nice , moist and juicy, hers however was a bit on the dry side. After trying my steak she wished she had gotten a medium steak as well! For dessert we both got the Dark Chocolate Tower with sour cherries. The dessert really wasn't as good as we thought it would be. It was kind of plain, not chocolaty enough , not really as sweet as other dark chocolate cakes we are used to, but someone who likes their dessert less sweet might like this cake, the two of us not so much.

I know other restaurants have policies such as they cannot seat you until at least half of your party is here especially for parties of 6+. Or they may choose to enforce only during busy times such as night time and weekends. But to not seat me when the restaurant is obviously not full and not going to be any time soon and I'm only a party of two is I think a bit ridiculous.

The waiter and kitchen were extremely accommodating as one individual of our group was celiac (gluten-free) and the other being pescetarian (vegetarian + fish). They were able to swap items in and out of the tasting menu to accommodate what they desired and needed. They even served gluten-free bread for the one member of the party and reassured her that each dish was gluten-free. The décor was quite nice and gives you a feel that you're in a remote cottage somewhere. They even had a fireplace burning near the front of the restaurant which scented all our coats in the coat room also located at the front... for better or for worse. Food - I found to the food to be hit and miss. For some of the items in tasting menu, I found it to be a bit bland and required more seasoning. A good example would be the Pomme de Terre - while the lobster was very well cooked, there was a lack of cream and seasoning which made the potatoes dry and tasteless. However, the dish that stood out for me and that was the cod, mussel and shrimp dumpling in a consommé (dish may change with the season). The fish was perfectly cooked and all the items on the plate were propped up with carrots to prevent them from getting soggy in the consommé - very well thought out and well executed dish. As they were in season, we had white truffle added to some of our dishes. They were fragrant and added another dimension to the dish. Not many restaurants in Toronto offer white truffles during the holiday season, so this was a very nice addition. I think the desserts are an area of opportunity for the restaurant. The donuts that came with the tasting menu were good, but were not too sophisticated or inspired. I also got the soufflé which was a tad undercooked.  Price - as with any fine dining restaurant, prepare your wallet. We went a little overboard with the wine and white truffles, so that shouldn't be a representation of a normal dinner at Auberge. If you are a little more cost conservative, wait for winter/summerlicious to try out the restaurant's offerings.

The atmosphere in this place is amazing! Starting from the decor, to the service, to the amazing bar setup, and the DJ spinning great music. Also - the patio is a great chill out spot. Our group came here for a birthday and we enjoyed ourselves overall. Didn't have any problems with service, and loved our drinks. I got the Mango Margarita and a minty Mojito I forgot the name of, and both were very tasty and also really strong. Although the prices were a little steeper than average, I felt like I got my bang for buck because the liquor content was really worth it. Beers were around $9/pint and shots (Tequila) starting at around $6. Not incredibly overpriced (given the area - Distillery District), but there are definitely cheaper places out there. The only downside we faced was with the food. My boyfriend (the birthday boy) and I shared the mahi mahi ceviche, raw beef tostada, and Baja fish tacos. My favourite would have to be the Baja fish tacos, but at $15 for 3 really small tacos, you could easily go to Kensington for a better meal for both your stomach and wallet. The ceviche was also really fresh and good. No complaints about the tostada but it wasn't memorable either. So while the food didn't disappoint us, it also wasn't good or big enough to justify the price. Note: Two of our friends ordered a pork dish and complained it was mostly fat. However, when they complained that there was a chip on of their beer mugs, the manager came over straight away and replaced the beer with a free full pint. Impression: good service, not so great food. All in all, spending over $80 for two mixed drinks (albeit large and strong ones), a shot of tequila, and three small dishes and a shared guacamole (granted, they made it fresh table side - nice touch) for the table (of 6 people), just didn't seem worth it for me. Even with the fantastic ambience and atmosphere! Verdict: I don't regret coming here, it's definitely worth checking out and our experience was more or less good. We had a fun time!

Back to the green curry though... it was amazing. Just the perfect mix of coconuty sweetness and spiciness (I chose medium spiciness). The pad thai was pretty damn good too if a little less special than the green curry. The only downside to this place is that it gets crazy busy so be sure to make reservations well ahead of time.

Settled with a 6:30 pm slot on a Monday evening and although it was relatively busy, you could probably take your chances doing a walk-in on a weekday.Contemporary decor but still had a very classy vibe. Lamb Ribs ($14) - These were delicious but tiny!! 3.5 small lamb ribs (the 4th one was more like a twig with barely any meat) that are tender, mildly flavored with a crispy texture. Not exactly the best value but taste-wise, 4/5  Roasted Red Beets ($13) - I debated whether or not to order this dish pretty much until the very last minute when I decided to just take a leap of faith and trust my fellow Yelpers. So glad I did as it was the highlight of the night. I was hesitant because my boyfriend and I aren't the greatest fan of red beets but you can hardly taste it when mixed with the labneh which had the perfect consistency and creaminess. Served with some delicious barbari bread, this dish is one you don't want to pass up on. 5/5Crispy Squid ($13) - This one was a decent portion but the individual pieces of squid are very small. Lightly fried and the spices and garlic sauce (toum) give it a nice kick. Very flavorful dish overall and tasted great with our rice. Probably one of the least traditional items because frankly, it's basically calamari with some Eastern Mediterranean seasonings. But I wasn't there to judge (nor would I know) how authentic their food was, so 3.5/5 Turkish Manti Dumplings ($14) - I was looking forward to this the most but it ended up being the biggest disappointment of the night. Such a shame. The dumplings were underwhelming to say the least. I actually didn't even know they were filled with eggplant until the fourth one or so because the ones I ate prior had nothing in it. The molasses balanced the yogurt really well but other than that, nothing special. 2/5Tartufata ($30) - Probably the most expensive rice I've ever had.The truffle and mushrooms were decadent and the fried chick peas were amazing. Crispy and flavorful. The rice itself is very ordinary. So all things considered, I can't say it was completely worth it. I wouldn't order it again because I'd like to try their other rice offerings which looked and sounded just as appealing. 4/5Seared Cauliflower ($8) - It's considered to be a side so I'd recommend ordering this with one of their meat dishes (ribeye, lamb shoulder, etc.) because I think it'd compliment it quite well. We just thought cauliflower with duck fat sounded awesome so we couldn't resist and ordered it anyway. I prefer stronger flavors so I loved this but heads up it can be a bit heavy. 4/5As for dessert, we had the Loukmades ($12) - Fantastic! We were pretty full and while waiting, we kept negotiating how many bites each person would take to finish it. Ended up fighting over the last piece. Pretty much burnt honey icecream on a krispy kreme donut (but a different shape). So good and a must-order!! 5/5  Service was lackluster.  Our server was kind and filled our water pretty often but eventually disappeared. We found ourselves waiting a lot - to order dessert, to ask for the bill and to pay. Service shouldn't end after the customer finishes their main course but rather when they walk out the door. Also, typical of many high-end restaurants, they explain what's in every dish but it was spewed out so quickly that a lot of it was incoherent. Didn't really add any value to our dinner.  A little overhyped but I'd come back because their menu still has a few other interesting items I'd like to try. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone who's looking to celebrate a special occasion or somewhere nice to go for a first date. Just don't expect to be blown away.

I last visited this place a few months ago and had such an awful experience that I could've sworn I reviewed it. But some how that review is no longer here. So I'm going to post it again. I've been coming here for years. When this place first opened and the original owners were still here, I think I came 5-6 times a month. I was addicted. The last few times, I started seeing some changes. I didn't think much of it until I started noticing the food quality going down. That prompted me to do a bit of research and that's when I learned how the original owners, Jeff and Nuit Regular, had a falling out with their (former) partner Monte Wan. Clearly the awfulness that is now Khao San Road has to do with Wan's influence. First, the service was atrocious. I ordered my usual which was squash fritters and pad gra prao. I noticed there were some new spice levels. So I asked for Thai spicy. Immediately the waitress gave me this look and asked if I had that level before. Technically I haven't because I haven't had to order a level before. She immediately followed up her question with because if you find it too spicy we won't fix it for you. WTF. 1) I just wanted it as spicy as it used to be. 2) I don't know how spicy is your Thai spicy without trying it first and 3) learn some customer service skills before you work in this industry. In the meantime, STFU bitch. Now, the food quality has definitely changed. So it's not like the food is so amazing that it can excuse the shit rules and service. I'm reading the recent reviews and I don't know how people are still saying it's amazing. Really?! The squash fritters tasted pre-fried and sitting out for awhile and the pad gra prao was under seasoned. Are they using Thai basil now or something? It's definitely different. I realize that I must sound like I work for Pai, the Regulars's new place, or I'm affiliated with them or something. Well I don't and I haven't even tried Pai yet. I just found out about it so I look forward to trying it in the near future. I noticed they have pad gra prao on the menu so I can't wait. I know Nuit Regular will make it right.

This is how our evening played out. Took the scenic elevator up and was able to enjoy the beautiful city lights. Arrived close to 6pm on a Sunday and noticed it was quite empty, but for some reason they had difficulty finding us a table for 4... We were politely told to wait while the 2 hostesses scrambled for 10 minutes to come up with the ingenious plan of placing 2 round tables together to form a table of 4. The restaurant appeared to be overstaffed with many workers wandering aimlessly back and forth making eye contact with their hands because God forbid they actually look at the patrons to see if they have been attended to. We waited 15 minutes before we got our bread, another 10 minutes before someone noticed we didn't get our water yet and finally after 30 minutes of being seated our waitress acknowledge our existence. She apologized several times as she was not informed that she was suppose to wait tables on our side of the restaurant. Nothing against our waitress, she was pleasant and tried her best to serve in this disorganized and poorly managed restaurant.Our highlight of the night was the bread. The bread was warm, soft and kept our stomachs from devouring itself as we wait to place our orders. Everything went downhill after that warm fluffy bread. The food was mediocre at best. My entree, the lamb pasta, came with an extra ingredient... a strand of curly hair... Chef special i guess... Not only was the pasta not very tasty, that piece of hair just put me off for the rest of the evening. Our waitress was busy serving other tables so I had to tell the waitstaff that cleared our table what I had found in my dish. His response was just an oh... no apology no nothing. I proceeded to tell him to take it back as I'm too put off to eat another bite. About 15 minutes passed before our waitress learnt about the hair in the food and came by to apologize and advised us the manager will be with us shortly.It wasn't until another 15 minutes until the manager confusingly found his way to our table. Contrary to what appeared to be an overstaffed restaurant, the manager informed us 2 employees had called in sick, which resulted in the backlog and him serving tables as well. He reassured us that the kitchen staff all wear hair nets and etc, he apologized and offered me another dish which I declined. He then proceed to take my meal off the tab and give us a 15% off the entire bill which I believe was fair. It's just getting the bill took another 20 minutes which is beyond ridiculous.Customer service is definitely not a priority in this restaurant. We've been to CN Tower 360 (loved it!) which prior to our experience at Toula, would perceive them to be on a similar level of restaurants but boy were we fooled. Granted it wasn't a winterlicious special at 360 but isn't the purpose of winterlicious to entice potential patrons for another future visit? Not scare them off with mediocre food and extremely slow service?All in all, this horrible dining experience could have been immensely improved had the staff been properly trained to provide better customer service.

I refrained from eating all of mine just because I wanted to make sure I saved enough room for the main attraction (the steaks!).

We ordered a 18oz bone-in striploin from NE, USA as well as a 6oz tenderloin from Japan (A5 Black Tajima-Gunma Prefecture). You cannot come to this place and not get Wagyu from Japan. It is a must because the quality of the beef is absolutely delicious. With the two different cuts of meat from the different regions of the world, you can taste the difference in quality.

We ordered the massaman curry as that is a regular fav of mine at most curry places, and the pad gra prow. We asked for both to be foreign spicy but they said that they serve the dishes as mild or medium and could give us extra spice on the side. Good thing we did as I actually found the medium quite spicy. I found the pad gra prow underwhelming visually, and the beef in my curry to be actually pretty tough. I expected the beef to be tender and melt in your mouth quality. However, the flavours for both dishes were strong and tastes authentic, and I was happy my curry did not taste watered down as a lot of Thai places do. After being quite satisfied with our meals, we wanted to order dessert. However the staff notified us that they were out of everything..??? Possible on a regular Thursday night? I was quite disappointed. Overall, service was good but nothing over the top friendly, and the food was great. I thought it was a bit expensive as the portions were average but the flavours were definitely great. Our food took a long long time to come out (at least 30min) and I'm not sure if this is the norm or they were particularly busy this night. I liked that the location was within walking distance from the train stations, and I did not drive so I'm not sure what the parking situation is like. Overall I would recommend this place if you like the energetic, bustling atmospheric and good Thai food. Not a good place to having convos with your friends for a long time though as I found it quite distracting and hard to speak loud enough to hear everyone at my table.

Talk to your guests, get involved in the dining experience and train your people or this will be a short stay in Toronto.After the very poor experience I had originally i decided to give it another shot.  It seemed more organized.  But still lots of staff not focussed on customers but focussed on random conversations between themselves.  I don't mind waiting in line if the staff are working on fulfilling the customers orders but for over 5 minutes there were 9 of us in line and the staff was not taking any orders they were fulfilling the web orders.  That seems totally counter intuitive, the people who come to your restaurant get less prompt service than the customers who stay home.  If your web orders are going is well create a station where you fulfill those but give the customers priority service if they walk into your restaurant.I hope they figure it out but judging by my continued experience with very low customer service I don't have much hope.  This sort of service issue starts with the managers and boss figuring out what they want to offer their customers.  At this point I'd say the are making poor decisions.

Hard to miss, considering how lively everything is around here. It's also really close to practically everything, including Chinatown. The location, however, is very small. It's like a really long rectangular room with mirrors on one side to make it seem bigger than it really is. Even going to the bathroom can be tricky because the door swings into diners and people who may be walking down the aisle (like an airplane). Since it's so small, it also means that it's pretty hard to accommodate kids. I had brought my son, and that made things a bit cramped since without a high chair, he moves around a lot. But no matter - I was not to be deterred!I ordered the Tonkatsu black ramen since it was the closest match to the black garlic tonkatsu that I so enjoy. We also got the gyoza as a side. The food came out quickly, which was good for the customers since there was a long line outside and it was raining! Overall, I enjoyed the ramen very much. The noodles were the perfect texture and quite possibly the best part of the meal. The broth taste was lighter and more subtle than I think would be ideal, but still very tasty. You really can't go wrong with black garlic tonkatsu. The meat was tender and fell apart in my mouth. The gyoza were excellent, with just the right crisp and flavor. I really enjoyed the soft-boiled egg. It did, however, have a piece of egg shell in it.So what's the verdict? As much as I thoroughly enjoyed the meal, my mind still does wander back to San Mateo.

The noodles is an egg-noodle which is decent but I'm not usually a fan of it (personal preference). The lime did not add anything to the dish as the curry was way too thick and overpowering (could not even taste the fresh lime, which was meant to balance the richness).

It's an eclectic combination of random themes and items that might be best described as fusion. Fused between what, you might ask. Well you've got an obvious Japanese connection (with the ramen, omurice, and takoyaki offerings). There is a random Korean connection with the bibimbap options. And then there is some typical Chinese stuff (be it HK or Taiwan); most of the desserts fit in this category. It is hard to pinpoint what exactly they were trying to accomplish here. The menu is really quite disconnected, even moreso than Toronto's transit system.As for actual food quality, it is hit or miss. According to my companions, the ramen is quite good, though expectedly not quite up to the same standard as any authentic ramen house. Their rendition of bibimbap I found extremely awkward. It comes in a small bowl overflowing with toppings, to the point that you're unable to stir up the sauce into the bowl. And the bowl is actually quite small compared to the bibimbap you would get at any Korean place. It also is not as satisfying when it comes to flavour (beware that the sauce they give you is some other random sauce and not the standard gochujang). The teppanyaki rice seems interesting, but at the end of the day it's basically more or less a bulgogi (or something similar) served with rice ON the hot plate itself. Cute attempt at trying to be creative, but it's only about as creative as a Justin Bieber song.Desserts are interesting and good for some photos so that you can generate some social media envy.

We started our meal off with an order of olives, which were an assorted selection and warm.  My date had the bone marrow and I had the brioche and barolo cheese.  We may have been a bit  ambitious as the barolo cheese + bone marrow was a very rich combination but delicious.  You get a massive piece of cheese and it smothers the brioche underneath, which is great.  My date had the black fettuccine, cooked perfectly, but a warning if you are wary about seafood: the cuttlefish will be overpowering.  I had the veal tenderloin; IMO the best meal on the table.  The veal was a good sized portion and melted in my mouth.  Also highly recommended was our dessert.  I don't recall the name but we ordered a chocolate cake - it was not too sweet and decadent if you're a chocolate lover.  We made quick work of it.I'd definitely return here, maybe for party.  They had set together 3-4 tables for what looked like a 16 person party later in the evening which seemed like a great idea.  Also, they have a nice patio area.

There was about a 30 min lineup at the door, but we managed to skip the line by agreeing to take two seats in the corner of the bar. As a result, we were attended to by the two bartenders, who were friendly, but who got busier and less attentive as the evening went on. In particular, it was difficult to get their attention when we wanted to grab our bill, and also when they forgot to bring my friend utensils to eat her mac and cheese with. El Furny's main selling point is that every food item on the menu is $4.95, which is a RIDICULOUSLY good deal in downtown Toronto, hence this place's popularity. I got a burger with fries, and my friend got the mac and cheese, which she said was delicious. While the burger wasn't mindblowingly spectacular or anything, I really can't complain for the price, since both the burger and fries were better than fast food quality and did exceed my expectations. They also have an extensive drink menu, with various beers and cocktails, although they're not nearly as cheap as the food (about $6-$8 for a pint). Ended up being about $22 per person for a meal and two beers each, which was pretty good. While I enjoyed my experience and would definitely go back, I would only do so if I didn't have to wait in line for a long time, since the food, while good, wasn't amazing enough to warrant standing in line for 30+ mins.

Nothing in the taco really stood out though, other than the pickled jalapeño slices. Tostada de Ceviche with Albacore Tuna -- mmm...fried tacos are always good when they are light and crispy. It was covered in chopped fish, veggies, and guacamole.

It was by no means bad, but I didn't find anything remarkable about my food. After returning for a second time and trying a few other things, I kind of get it. I came with two friends on Friday and this time was seated in the room on the lower floor. This room is definitely more intimate and quieter than the main dining room, although less interesting to look at. To start, we ordered the fried calamari, which was actually really, really good. It was just lightly breaded, so it wasn't like the dough overwhelmed the taste of the squid. And I'm so glad it didn't, because the squid was fantastic! It tasted really fresh, and then the texture of it was just perfect - chewy and tender, but still quite soft and moist. Squeeze a bit of lemon juice on it, and it is just amazing. For my main, I tried the seafood spaghetti which everyone raves about. I kind of wish it came with a different kind of pasta, because spaghetti just seems so basic. That being said, it was a good pasta - the texture of the pasta was great, and once again, the seafood, which included clams, mussels, scallops, shrimp, and calamari was very fresh, sizeable (the shrimp were huge), and plentiful. I honestly can't get over the texture of their calamari in general, it's just so good. I will say that I thought the portion was a little bit on the smaller side for dinner though. I also sampled a bit of my friends' dishes. One got the pappardelle del iosa which comes with spicy sausage. One bite wasn't too spicy, but I think it would build up. I thought this was okay. My other friend ordered off the special menu for the day, and got pappardelle made with spinach (so the noodles were green) and which came with duck confit. I liked this one better, because I found the duck to be more flavourful than the sausage, although a bit on the salty side. Also the noodles were a bit firmer in this dish.For dessert, we split some kind of sponge cake thing which had limoncello and mascarpone. I quite enjoyed this, because it was very light and fluffy, not too sweet, and had quite a delicious zesty flavour. It was actually the perfect dessert for me and I would recommend.The takeaway from this is that Terroni knows how to do seafood right. Get the calamari and the seafood pasta, and you'll be impressed. I'm still a little iffy on some of their other dishes, but at least now I have a few solid tried-and-true favourites at this restaurant.

After our wait had exceeded an hour and we asked for an update we were told we would be seated shortly and the manager would do something for us. Figuring our group was on the verge of starvation (which we were) the manager came to us with a plate of canopies topped with a goat cheese bruschetta, absolutely delicious!

When we were finally seated everybody seemed to enjoy their food. It's the standard Keg menu so you are guaranteed a good steak. I had the French Onion soup to start and this was mind-blowing! So much cheese on top that was perfectly melted without being greasy, the broth was very rich and had a good beef flavour while the onion added a nice sweetness. I have never had a bad steak at the keg, and this occasion was no different. New York strip was cooked to perfection and was so tender it practically melted in my mouth, this time I tried it cooked Chicago style (meaning it is charred on the outside and cooked to order inside). This added a nice charred crust to the steak and actually did a better job of sealing in the juices; this cooking style is definitely worth a try. For sides I always go for the twice baked potato; bacon, cheese, and baked potato how could you go wrong?  This place gets bonus marks for letting our huge group split the bills and not adding an automatic gratuity (which most restaurants do for large groups).

Stand inside eating or stand/sit outside eating. Expect overcrowding during busy times. Many Kensington Market eateries are like this.* Cash only so bring $$$$. No special orders.* No washroom. Go before you go there.* Two tacos and a drink is enough for a meal* Get napkins and wet-naps to clean messy hands* Sample mild, medium and hot sauces before putting on tacos. Hot sauce is not for the weak. It's for those who can handle Armageddon Sauce at Duff's Chicken Wings. It will burn out your stomach lol. You have been warned!Hopefully, you will enjoy your tacos more after being informed of the above.I ordered the Poke 'N Chips and the Gobernator Taco. To drink, I had a bottle of Jarritos Strawberry Soda. The Poke 'N Chips, consisting of Hawaiian poke raw fish served on nacho chips, was a tasty dish combining the 2 popular dishes. It was not salty. Same for the Gobernator.The Mexican soda had natural strawberry flavouring and was a good change from all the local soft drinks I have been drinking.Previously, I had the Blackened Mahi Mahi and the Grilled Octopus Tacos. I enjoyed both tacos. They were not too salty as other reviewers may have said. The octopus was not chewy. The lemonade, made in house, was refreshing and not too sweet.I plan on trying the other tacos on the menu. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1527, 1541)",1,0.0,False
