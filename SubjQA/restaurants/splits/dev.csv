Just wanna try their brunch before 3pm!We sat in the comfy sofa at around 1.50pm and ordered Charlotte, Heaven on Earth, black coffee and hot chocolate.Hot chocolate and coffee came first. Disappointedly we didn't have the hot chocolate but a warm one, despite the fairly good glass that holds the chocolate. Black coffee is normal. Although there are just few tables of customers, the food came long after we finished the chocolate. So we also got a jar of water that came slow. At first when I was yelping and saw the Heaven on Earth french toast photo, I thought the cheese inside was ice cream but no. So I then ordered a ice cream topping too for my french toast since I think ice cream with any french toast is the best combination ever for me!! And yes, this combination never goes wrong.As I am not a cheese person (I can accept cheese like in grilled cheese), I think the thick cheese that stuffed in the french toast is too much for me. This would be a little reminder for some of you like me, to be careful of it haha. Stuffed Blueberries and strawberries are OK. One interesting note is that the french toast has a quite unique texture than most of the typical ones. The egg-like texture is soft and thick..with crispy corners of the bread. Perfect with maple syrup alone or the addition of ice cream.The salmon egg benedict was great too. The side potatoes are like potato fries; they won't occupy much of your stomach but instead giving you a crispy outer layer and hot and soft potato crust. The salmon was fantastic and it makes me speechless. I wonder how they cook it. Muffin below reminded me of McDonalds' muffins. Eggs were well-cooked; they are like poached eggs. Good for those egg lovers!Maybe because we went there late and finished our brunch late like 4pm, the waitress got us the bill once we finished our food. We didn't even have some time to rest or chat since she just came and asked us if we have anything to order, we said no and she said okay just the bill and she went to get us the bill right away. We felt weird or funny that why everything happened so fast lol haha. But all in all that was a quite good experience comparing to my last time late night dinner here.

I've been wanting to try this place since it opened and luckily I was able to find someone who was yet to have tried it.  Thanks for coming with me Justine H! In a nutshell, this place is like Oktoberfest, and now you can have it everyday at Wvrst!Wvrst  definitely has flavours of a European sausage and beer hall, and really reminded me of Oktoberfest (except nicer). It's spacious and dimly lit with with ceiling strung lights --a casually comfortable place.Wvrst MenuScattered around the hall tables were these long sheets of recycled paper which would be the menu. If you're looking for something other than fries, sausages, and alcohol, you're probably at the wrong place. The menu is simple, but the numerous options lie in the type of each you fancy.At the back of the establishment there is a long open space that leads up to a rather small counter where you order and pay. I imagine this empty space is filled up by a line up during busier lunch hours. It wasn't too bad on the Tuesday night that we went.Sausage Display CaseThe display case is neatly organized with all the different sausages that they have. If you're in the mood for some exotic meats, then you're in luck. They have everything from kangaroo to venison, rabbit to guinea fowl. Justine H and I weren't too appetized looking at it, but after we managed to get over its appearance we went up to the counter to order.DrinksThey have quite a number of beers here, bottled and on tap. Definitely not as many as a place like Beer Bistro might have, but more than just your commonly seen brews. Justine opted for the San Pellegrino Orange, and me an Austrailian beer Stiegl. Figured it was only fitting that I had a beer in the given setting!Bratwvrst ($6) -Veal, Pork, and WineDuck ($9) -Maple and Fois GrasThese contemporary European sausages for the most part were quite good. Juicy and full of flavour. Didn't feel like I was eating a super artificial chunk of meat like I do having hot dogs from street vendors. In terms of flavour, I think it really depends on the sausage you order. You could definitely taste the fois gras in the Duck sausage, which was something Justine H didn't enjoy too much. I didn't mind it and found it to be an interesting combination, but I definitely liked the Bratwvrst more. I'd like to add that these sausages are quite small, and even with my small appetite I was unsatisfied having just the one hot dog.Duck Fat Fries ($4.50)Lots of other food enthusiasts raved about these fries, so we ordered a serving to share. Perhaps it was the heightened expectations from all the amazing reviews, but these duck fat fries fell just a bit short. They were full bodied, thick, and buttery, but they just weren't amazing. To be honest, I couldn't differentiate what difference the duck fat had on the fries compared to the ones made in regular oil. The order of fries comes with one dipping sauce, and the Wvrst Spicy we chose was great. Definitely not the best fries I've had, but they are quite tasty still, and would easily satisfy those random starchy fry cravings.One last thing to note, is that they are big on leafs games here! They have a ticket giveaway at around 6:30pm the night of every Leaf's game at the Air Canada Center. With TV's all around the dining hall and tables that encourage conversation, it would be a great place to go catch the game along with a couple of drinks. But be warned, it might get pretty rowdy later in the night with cheering Leafs fans who've had a couple drinks or two! ANSWERNOTFOUND",sausages,"(1251, 1259)",2,0.0,False

They don't seat you until your entire party is there.The second thing you should know is that I have never been disappointed by any of the food there.  The fresh rolls are just that: fresh, and bursting with flavour.  Each vegetable and herb adds their own crunch and flavour in harmony.  I don't know what that mystery meat is (the menu goes with the vague chicken sausage) but it's dang good, and the accompanying sauce is double dip worthy.Of the main dishes, I've had Pad Gra Prao, Panang Curry, and Street Style Pad Thai.  Such an amazing balance of saltiness, sweetness, and spiciness.  There's a lot of depth to each dish, and having had North Americanized curries and pad thai before, the difference is strikingly obvious.  Everything has been a winner so far.  The price is right, too.  The curry of the day is $8, about the same kind of price you'd find at the food court, but with vastly superior food.  So the food, in my experience, is pretty terrific.  The service is usually as good.  The servers are very friendly and attentive.  Service with a smile!  If you arrive earlier than 11:45 and don't dilly dally, you can usually get your order in before the massive lunch crush which is helpful if you want to leave in a more reasonable amount of time.  If you get caught with the crowd, there could a little bit of a wait for the food.I'd eat here all the time if I wasn't on a quest to try different things.

Earlier I mentioned the Yelp reviews about this place and at this point people were already rolling their eyes with dissatisfaction.I made the mistake of telling the waitress I had never been to the place before and so we got a mini-lecture on the place.  Do yourselves a favour and say you've already been here.  You'll save yourself 5 minutes of your life.  I ordered a litre mug of their blonde beer and my friend ordered the amber.  The blonde wasn't very good, not much more to say about that.  I tried my friend's amber and it was slightly better so maybe go for that instead.  Most other people just ordered water and noted that their beer cocktails taste terrible from previous visits.Like everyone else has said, the food menus were pretty average and the food selection was nothing special - your typical pub food.  I opted for the calzone flamme, simply because I kept hearing it on the radio and figured it would go pretty well with the beer.  In case you don't know, a flamme is esentially a thin crust pizza with no tomato sauce.  It's actually not bad but again, nothing special if you've had pizza in your life.Overall, a pretty average experience.  One thing we did realize is that there was a barrel of peanuts that you could self-serve anytime.  They even have little paper bags in case you want to take some with you.

They are wrong. Although the $2 Banh Mis are a steal, and make for a quick lunch, you are certainly getting what you pay for when you go to Banh Mi Boys. My sandwich came up to $6.77, which was very reasonable for what I got. This place must have an immense amount of pressure to keep their prices down given a) the competition in the areab) the fact that most people who know what a Banh Mi is are used to paying $2 on SpadinaTherefore, the fact that they can offer what they do at this price point is impressive.The Food (Pork Belly Sandwich):- The bread was very fresh, tasty, and was toasted perfectly (not too hard, not too soft)- There was a decent amount of tasty, tender meat. It was a little fatty, but this is to be expected from pork belly- The meat was of good quality; leaps and bounds better than the mystery meat of the classic $2 Banh Mi. - The vegetables were also very fresh, and I enjoyed how there was a pickle in the sandwich which I have never had before- The hot sauce was great as always (I'm a big fan of this sweet hot sauce in Banh Mi sandwiches)- I asked for spicy, and the hot sauce was unevenly distributed with one half being medium and the other half being very hot. This isn't a deal breaker, but just an observation.The atmosphere:- Loved the music they were playing in here. Great old school hip hop playing at good volume- The decor was decent. I liked the lamp shades on the lights- The staff was friendly and helpful.- The cleanliness of the place was pretty poor, and this is why the place gets a 3, instead of the 4 it would have received if it was cleaner. There were discarded napkins and food under every single table, with as many as 10 or more discarded napkins under some tables. The 2 tables that were free had varying degrees of mess on the tables from previous customers. There were no tables whose tops were completely clean. I can understand that some customers are quite messy and that the employees may not have had time to clean up after these people, but given that there was a mess under and on every table indicates to me that staff had not cleaned in while, and did not care about the establishment's general cleanliness. One of my biggest pet peeves at a fast food joint is when the place is this messy, because it makes me feel like I'm eating in a barn.That being said, the food here was great, and I will go back to this place, and change my review if the place cleans itself up.

We're talking about Thai spicy that can keep you mouth hot bite after bite.

The shrimp is seasoned and crispy, a dash of spice that adds an authentic flavor to the magic dish. Cashew chicken is also very tasty. Chicken is well cooked but juicy within.

Obviously, eating atop a giant tower in a revolving restaurant will inflate food and drink prices a bit.  There are two- and three-course meal options available and a la carte selections.  The meal options are a way better deal because you get similar (or the same) entree with additional food.  The three-course menu was $79CAD per person (about $60US per person).  Drinks were $5-$10US, so typical of a restaurant/bar.  Some of the cocktails were a bit pricier but also fancier so you get what you pay for.  I enjoyed my soup (yellow tomato and corn gazpacho) and baked ziti with wild mushrooms.  There weren't a ton of mushrooms in the entree, but the ziti and chili sauce were delicious.  My husband got the aged ribeye entree and really enjoyed it.  It was a little too rare (even though he ordered medium rare) so maybe make sure they cook it medium throughout and not just one section of the cut.  Since they served bread before the meal, I filled up on a bit too much of that (there was some waiting between app and entree) so I almost couldn't finish my dessert.  I had the sorbet which was delicious and my husband had ice cream and cookies, which he loved.  The homemade fig newton was yummo.   Obviously, the view is excellent.  It takes 72 minutes for the restaurant to make one full rotation and they seem to have dinner timed pretty well to coincide with that revolution.  We basically ended where we started (a little later) so we were only up there for like 90 minutes.  Even though there are a lot of people, it didn't seem too loud and our server was funny and there whenever we needed him.  We actually witnessed a proposal in their wine cellar which was super cute and the couple was obviously ecstatic.  This was a great place to spend our 5th wedding anniversary.  We enjoyed the views, the bar below was quick and not super full while we waited for our reservation time, and our dinner came with complete access to the two levels of viewing decks, including the glass floor.  We spent a bit of time down there after the meal and really enjoyed ourselves, even though it was still crowded for 11 p.m. Reservations are easy to make on their website so make sure you do that because it seemed like 95% of the tables were reserved when we arrived at 9 p.m. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2386, 2400)",1,0.0,False

She was right: we proceeded to wait 45 minutes to be seated. As for an explanation, the manager couldn't get her story straight. She told me that our table was being set up and would be ready any minute, while another person reported she had said (moments later) that our table was still occupied and they couldn't kick out other patrons, even if they were taking forever to pay. In truth, they were overbooked and understaffed.When we finally got to our table, there was no apology or acknowledgement of the situation or how long we had to wait, even with a reservation. The food (which, unsurprisingly, took forever to arrive) was decent but not worth the headache and certainly not the best brunch I've had in Toronto.

Got to the door and the screwface hostess asked how many we were then asked us to wait in line. From the outside we could see the patio and it was maybe 40% full.

Guac came out almost immediately by an adorable, personable guy mushing up the avocado in front of us and making it a great app to start with. See? I'm really not just here to complain :)My friend's eggs came almost right away. They were lukewarm and you know when bean dip has been sitting and starts to harden a bit on the outside? That's how his plate came. My food didn't come with his. Isn't it restaurant 101 to serve meals together, especially when it's just two people? I didn't want his food to get even cooler so I told him to start, thinking mine would be out any minute. He finished his meal before my food came out 45 minutes after ordering. My food was seriously the tiiiiiiniest portion, so the claim of good for one person was a joke. The chorizo was old, served on stale corn cakes. I took one bite and was through with the place. We were on a time constraint so when the waitress asked if she could bring me something else, we just asked for the bill. It was a little expensive but I was expecting that for the venue, because it really is gorgeous. Settling the bill took over ten minutes which annoyed me because I just told you I'm on a time crunch and you know I had a shitty meal so why aren't you being more accommodating? Oh, and the bill came to 56, my friend left 70, and the waitress brought back 15 even, so we had no choice but to leave her 10 without seriously stiffing her. So tactless right? It all just felt so Moxie's. Like I was being served by university students trying to make a buck but took no pride in the place.

We followed it up with the steak tartare which was a delight with the Middle Eastern flare of the labneh/chili/mint sauce.  It was a very satisfying dish.The lamb ribs were the last mezze that we were expecting and they delivered in flavour (not too strong lamb flavour) and paired well with the buttermilk ranch and poppin' red chili sauce.At this point I do have to say the pacing of the meal was fantastic and something I can appreciate.  We had a small table so it could only fit one to two dishes at any given time.For mains, we settled for the Middle Eastern fried chicken and the spanish octopus along with a side of seared cauliflower.  I think the Middle Eastern fried chicken was the winner between the two.  it was crispy on the outside whilst the meat was juicy and tender on the inside.  The red schug hot sauce which had quite the kick was a perfect accompaniment to make you sweat a few drops from your forehead.  I was less impressed with the spanish octopus though, it felt a little tough in my opinion but it didn't stop me from enjoying the dish through and through.Too stuffed for dessert but I had a wonderful experience at Byblos and would recommend it to those looking for a modern take on Middle Eastern and Mediterranean style dishes.

A girlfriend and I have been eying this place for a while. Usually, I would wait until all the hype dies down but for this restaurant I don't think it's going to die down anytime soon. Regardless of the day or time, this place is always packed but trust me the wait was absolutely worth it. I guess what made this place really stand out is the environment. Once you step through those doors, you are literally transformed into a different world. It felt like you just nested into the heart of small Tokyo bar. This place is really ALIVE with all the sights and sounds of what a real Japanese restaurant should be like. Just on the environment alone, I already fell in love with this place. I wish we sat at the bar however, it would be so fascinating to watch the cooks & staff interact with each other. They seem like the really love what they are doing and  just by that, you know the food would definitely deliver.So, we ordered a couple of things. Here's my take on them:TAKOWASABI: You have to be a true fan of wasabi to like this dish because it really hits you in the face. ABURI SALMON: The texture of this dish was amazing - the salmon melts in your mouth and the fried onion chips really added that extra something-something to it.HOTATE CARPACCIO: I loved this dish, it was light and refreshing but I really wish we got this dish first. With all the other overwhelming flavours of the other dishes, this dish found itself on the bland side. Pity really because the presentation was beautiful.SOY SAUCE MARINATED B.C TUNA: Literally MELTS in your mouth but it didn't stand out to the other dishes. However, still some of the best tuna sashimi I've had to date. TAKOYAKI: MUST MUST MUST try. Once I had one, I just wanted more.  Enough Said.KABOCHA KOROKKE: This is probably my favourite dish, maybe because I am a huge pumpkin fan however, I was slightly disappointed. I was expecting the outside to be a lot crisper. Maybe it was just ours. Will have to try it again!! & TOFU CHEESECAKE: Yum. Yum. Yum. Period.It was just overall an amazing experience and I really can't wait to head back. There's still a lot on the menu that I would still love to try out. Although the food & environment was amazing, the icing on the cake was the staff. They were fast and ran like a well oiled machine. The waiters were cheerful and helpful. A small incident happened at Guu, a waiter accidentally broke a glass bottle behind my friend and in literally 10 mins, the mess was cleaned up and the boss came out to apologize and offered us some complimentary edamame. That, there my friends is what you call superb customer service. We ordered 8 things and it came up to be $50 dollars. Honestly, thats an amazing deal for the quality and services Guu provided.

This review is only for the patio area and menu- I would still highly recommend the food served inside.It's a shame, because the patio is beautiful, with lots of potential to be the setting for a great dining experience. I ordered the green tea mojito and lobster watermelon salad. The mojito, while tasting nothing of green tea, was very nice, if a little bit sweet for my taste. The salad was a disaster. The lobster was rubbery and tasted... a little off. It had me thinking, this probably won't poison me, but it tastes like it's been dead a little too long. The nicely shredded cabbage was ruined by a dressing that tasted like lightly watered down mayonnaise. The slice of watermelon, which I was counting on for a fresh hit of fruit, was unfortunately soaked through with the water/mayonnaise horror, and so the salad was left without a single redeeming feature. Strange lobster and bland dressing does not a $24 salad make.For dessert, I ordered a trio of sample portions: vanilla creme brulee, chocolate something or other, and a mixed berry compote trifle. The creme brulee was very good, the chocolate was fairly good, but the trifle had a strange, almost yeasty tang. I was finished with it after a single bite.The hostess/waitress/bartender was friendly and pleasant, but seemed very inexperienced. She mixed up my mother's salad order and dessert order, and seemed somewhat bewildered throughout our lunch.Overall, a disappointing experience at a usually excellent restaurant.

We made a reservation for 7 pm on a Thursday, and the restaurant was pretty packed. The interior is quite dark and a bit dingy, with old decor on the walls and lights. It is certainly nothing fancy, but we had an epic meal. The server brought out warm, fresh garlic bread and pickled carrots and pickles to start. The garlic bread was so delicious, and reminded me of something that my mom used to make. I'm a huge pickle fan, so I was really into this. We ordered the shrimp cocktail (~$29) and the escargots (~$11) to start. My husband said the escargots were pretty good, and the shrimp cocktail was just OK. The shrimp didn't seem overly fresh to me. In hindsight, appetizers were not necessary at all, because the meals are HUGE. Me and my MIL ordered the filet mignon wrapped in bacon (~$55) and my husband ordered the rib steak (~$57). Barberian's is known for the rib steak, and my husband really enjoyed this, but I have to say that my filet was probably the best filet I've ever had. It literally melted in my mouth. I ordered fries with my steak (delicious, but could have been hotter), and we also ordered the onion rings, which were to die for. I ate so much food that I couldn't move by the end of the meal. I did finish my steak, but it was a struggle.  The wine list is very extensive, with both expensive and reasonably priced bottles.

Since the reviews were so good, we decided to hang out in the chilly weather for just under an hour before getting seated at the bar. Luckily, we only had 3 people in our group. The place tends to have a pretty quick turnover as the ramen is served fresh, hot and quick. It may be a bit longer a wait for larger groups as the place is not too big. Once seated at the bar, we ordered some hot sake and the shio ramen. The ramen noodles were cooked just right, not too firm or overcooked. Very good consistency, and it soaked nicely in the delicious creamy broth. The pork belly was tender, juicy, and full of fat (my favorite). I went with the regular size bowl which was the perfect size for a meal that would permit me to still walk out without feeling too full. The hot sake was a perfect compliment to the soup and cold weather. I was not able to finish the rest of the broth as it was getting a tad bit too salty and I needed to save room for dessert.

The staff are friendly and quick and the owner is very nice as well. He even gave us free salads few times because we visited his restaurant so frequently. 4. The food is DELICIOUS!My personal recommendations:1. Greek fries are to die for and a must! 2. My fave gyro in a pita would be the chicken, so much flavor and so crispy, and I find it has less fat than the lamb! What I love the most about the gyro is that they are not afraid to add some garlic, which adds a great deal of flavor I find!3. I also enjoy the Greek salad.

Although I am new to writing an official review on Yelp, my husband and I are no stranger to frequenting a variety of top restaurants in Toronto and around the world for that matter.  Last night was our first time at Cluny and we were both very excited to try it out.  When we walked in, we were immediately impressed with the quaint French bistro décor and overall feel and ambiance.  Loved the little bakery at the front of the restaurant.  When we arrived, we were not greeted by anyone (restaurant wasn't even busy at this point 6:45 Monday evening), after about 5 mins of standing there looking around, someone that looked like he was one of the Chefs (who happened to be getting something in the stock room/closet, finally said someone will be with you shortly.  We were greeted by the hostess with a less than impressive hello.  After we were seated, it took about 10mins before we were acknowledged by our Waiter for the evening.  Again, was not impressed by his demeanor and lack of interest in us as guest.  We've probably had better service at a local Chain restaurant or a drive thru for that matter!  Our appetizers came relatively quickly (Oysters, Cod balls and Caesar salad).  The Caesar salad was a complete disappointment, perhaps I had high expectations but when you proudly call a dish Cluny Caesar with a price tag of $13+ I would expect a little more than 2 branches of Romaine barely drizzled with dressing and 4-5 chick peas and feta lining the bottom.  We ordered Oysters and when it was  brought to us, the Waitress was trying to explain the different Oysters and said Oh and I forget what this one is called.... Anyway, I don't want to get too lengthy with the review here but all in all I would rate the food quite good (minus the Caesar salad) at this restaurant but the underwhelming service takes this place to a whole new low.  The atmosphere in terms of décor and ambiance were excellent, very reminiscent of a bistro in Paris which is a rare find here.  The service was beyond below average.  Our waiter (middle aged male, appeared quite sloppy if I can be honest) was inattentive, unpleasant and simply unprofessional.  He did not check on us until our dinner was done and did not even utter a Thanks or good bye when we paid the bill.  This is definitely a very poorly managed establishment with very disengaged, unprofessional/untrained staff, you can see it in their demeanor and even the way they are dressed. I think the hostess was wearing running shoes and some other waiters were dressed in black golf shirts or sports bra like gym attire.  I am disappointed because this place has potential.

Walking down Parliament street we totally missed this restaurant and had to back track to find it. It's actually located in the basement but there were street level signs.Stepping inside it was very under whelming. Without all these positive yelp reviews and my desire to indulge in there famous jerk chicken I may have just turned around and left. The restaurant is really dated with old school wood panelled walls, tiny rickety cafeteria tables, and matching wood panelled banquets with saggy pinstriped cushions.Before I had chance to consult with my hubby of our intentions of staying or leaving our lovely waitress Kim warmly welcomed us and told us to grab a seat anywhere. It was just past 4pm and the restaurant although tiny had about 8 other guests dining. We took a seat against the banquet beside the bar at a corner table. I have to admit the seats were a bit uncomfortable as the wood panelled banquets were awkwardly angled at least they had some sort of cushion and the small table seemed to be at awkward height as well but nothing I couldn't manage. Kim came back and delivered us the menus, informed us of the specials, and brought us a pitcher of ice water with sliced cucumbers inside which was a nice touch. They also have daily specials that change all the time but we both knew what we wanted the jerk chicken dinners. We asked to sub the jasmine rice that it comes with for peas and rice and Kim said no problem. I thought there would be an extra cost to do that but surprisingly there wasn't. Kim asked if we like our jerk chicken spicy or mild and we both wanted spicy. She also explained that they grill the chicken made to order so it may take a while. We were both cool with that as hearing our food was not precooked and being made fresh for us was another bonus.Kim was really nice and chatted with us and keep us posted on the status of meals. What was also nice to see was as guests came in you could see that they were all regulars as she greeted them by name and had there drink orders memorized.When our meal finally arrived I was in heaven. After that first bite of chicken I knew why there were soo many regulars and why it was so raved about. Seriously some the best jerk chicken i've ever had! The chicken itself was soo juicy and tender, seasoning was perfect, nice grill flavour, and the heat was good without being too much. What I also loved about this chicken was it was all boneless chicken, mostly thigh meat, and not saucy so you get that nice dry jerk seasoning through the moist tender meat. The meal also came served with a garden salad and homemade coleslaw. Normally I hate coleslaw but this one was pretty good, not too creamy and it had a nice tangy sweet and sour flavour. The peas and rice were also really good and the hidden gem in this dish was the bit of oxtail gravy over the rice and a little piece of oxtail with bone. The oxtail was also amazing, so tender and flavourful you could tell they really stewed it well. It was such a nice surprise to find it under the chicken but such a tease because it was soo good it made me want more.At the end of our meal we were highly satisfied. The portion was ample with lots meat and we definitely fulfilled our jerk chicken craving. This restaurant is also really affordable I think our meal was $11 each which I thought was a total steal! Fresh, flavourful food and a waitress that's soo warm and welcoming you can totally see why so many people keep coming back here. I will definitely be returning to get my jerk chicken fix and to try the oxtail dinner! ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3682, 3696)",2,0.0,False

Jason was very informative and knew all the dishes as well as gave his personal opinion on certain foods he likes. The atmosphere had a chill vibe with some cool indie pieces. The restaurant was situated underground and near a cool district with lots of other cool restaurants. Food,I went for the vegetable spring rolls as a starter and boy oh boy it was very tasty. The dipping sauce it came with was a winner. The roll was your typical vegetable spring roll with a hard crispy breaded coating that delivers an incredible taste. Next is the main appetizer, I got the Chicken Pad Thai in medium. Slightly disappointed because I expected it to be a bit more spicy but nonetheless it was still tasty!  Not your typical pad thai for sure. Generally I dont finish food from other restaurants but Pai was an exception. Every bite I took from the pad thai made me want to get another. The portion you get was massive, enough to feed two but if you're really hungry then this should be a good size portion. Lastly the dessert, I'm saddened to think, I actually forgot the name of the dessert but if your Filipino it was a twist on suman. The dessert was sticky rice but it had a sweet taste to it. The taste wasn't a sweet overpowering dessert it was quite subtle. It had mango on top. Overall Pai is the best Thai food i've ever ate in my life.

Khao San Road's chef doesn't hold back on Thai spices and garlic which allows their dishes to be bursting with Thai flavor. Salad King's dishes are much more toned down and compared to Khao San Road, it could seem a little bland in terms of flavor. Because of the spices, Khao San Road's dishes feels heavy whereas Salad King's dishes seem lighter (if that makes any sense). It's really a personal preferance as to if you prefer Khao San Road or Salad King.Summary: Khao San Road focuses on staying true to Thai flavors, so be aware and get ready to taste some garlic if you've only tried food court Thai food. Personally, I like both places- I def think Khao San Road makes better Pad Thai but if I wanted noodles in coconut curry, I would visit Salad King for Islamic Noodles.

We ordered extra friend rice and noodles to eat with the lobster but they never came until the end. No one offered water, waitress was never found. We had their congee - bland and watery. We asked for soy sauce and it was brought out in rice bowls, 10 bowls of soy sauce!!  Never before have we seen such thoughtless service. We brought a family of friends there for Father's Day lunch and were so embarrassed that we chose this restaurant.  Our food took too long to come. Not going back there.

The food was actually pretty good and above average. First off, getting a reservation wasn't too hard. We showed up a the front of CN tower and lined up to go through to obnoxious security (which I can prove to be useless). Took about 5 minutes to pass through the line and another couple minutes for the security to check your stuff. Walked into the lobby and straight up to the reception. I asked if it was possible to get a reservation for a table for 5. She said there were tables available and we could get booked for first seating at 11am. Going up to the restaurant took longer than passing through security and the reservation process. I believe they only have 2 lifts for the restaurant and they work simultaneously, but still we had to wait for about 15 minutes. Scored a window seating. Server was nice and had a sense of humor. Worth mentioning: - Dry Aged Ribeye, claimed to be 40+ day aged. I personally eat a lot of dry aged beef because we have a local butcher which does aging. The aged beef served at the restaurant didn't have the aged beef taste that I was hoping for. But, it was super juicy and tender. Grilled close to perfection. - Mussels (appetizer), these were good. They mussels used were pretty meaty and the soup base had plenty of taste to them. Failed: - Cod, horribly done.. super dry- Pan Seared Atlantic Salmon, skip as well. Dry The chefs don't seem to know how to do fish well. Price = pretty decent for $59CAD which = to be about $45USD. The ribeye was much more, but we don't need to talk about that right now. It cost about $33CAD = $25USD for general admission of the tower, which you only get to walk around and take a few pictures. For a few bucks more, you can enjoy your lunch or dinner and sit in for over and hr to get the spectacular view and eat something. Take this for example, if you just go up to the tower and come back down, you still need to spend money on food. Considering a hotdog and soft drink will probably cost you 10CAD. You do the math.

This is your standard Keg restaurant only it is located in a HUGE mansion, making for an amazing ambiance and a gorgeous setting. I went here for a friend's birthday on a Saturday night, we were a group of 15 and since they don't take reservations on Fridays or Saturdays we were certainly in for a long wait (we were told about an hour). After our wait had exceeded an hour and we asked for an update we were told we would be seated shortly and the manager would do something for us. Figuring our group was on the verge of starvation (which we were) the manager came to us with a plate of canopies topped with a goat cheese bruschetta, absolutely delicious! A few minutes later she comes with a giant plate of fully loaded nachos, and these may have been some of the best nachos I have ever had! Loaded with lots of cheese (and high quality cheese at that) made them warm and very gooey, lots of jalapenos added a nice kick, I would definitely order these when I go back!  When we were finally seated everybody seemed to enjoy their food. It's the standard Keg menu so you are guaranteed a good steak. I had the French Onion soup to start and this was mind-blowing! So much cheese on top that was perfectly melted without being greasy, the broth was very rich and had a good beef flavour while the onion added a nice sweetness. I have never had a bad steak at the keg, and this occasion was no different. New York strip was cooked to perfection and was so tender it practically melted in my mouth, this time I tried it cooked Chicago style (meaning it is charred on the outside and cooked to order inside). This added a nice charred crust to the steak and actually did a better job of sealing in the juices; this cooking style is definitely worth a try. For sides I always go for the twice baked potato; bacon, cheese, and baked potato how could you go wrong?  This place gets bonus marks for letting our huge group split the bills and not adding an automatic gratuity (which most restaurants do for large groups). Definitely a great place to go with a large group, on a special occasion, or simply for a nice dinner. Overall great food, beautiful restaurant and good service! *My only complaint is the drinks were pretty expensive, bought a shot for my friend and it was nearly $9 for a standard shot! That's pricy!

I made our reservation well in advance and showed up prompt at 6:30pm. Although it was a Tuesday night the place was pretty packed. We were greeted by a lovely hostess who led us to our table on the 2nd floor. Our table was located against a grey leather banquet in the left corner. I think this had to be the best table on that level as it was far enough away from the  other 2 adjacent tables and we had the whole corner to ourselves which gave us a great view of the entire floor.The menu here is predominantly mediterranean and served tapas style meant for sharing. Our waiter was really attentive all night long and each dish came out in a timely manner giving us plenty of time to enjoy one before the next course arrived. I also really enjoyed how the waiter would describe everything on plate as they delivered it to us.We started off with the Fig Salad which has to be one of the best salad i've ever had! It was so fresh with bright citrus flavours. I loved the crunch from the roasted pistachios, and the creamy salty bits of Ackawi cheese which was a nice contrast against the sweet figs. There were also notes of cardamom in the salad which was surprising to taste yet it complimented the dish so well.Next came the Lamb Ribs. I absolutely love lamb but have never had the ribs before and these were exquisite! The meat was soo tender, juicy, and flavourful and I adored the contrast of crunchy salty coating.For mains we had to have the Daily Chargrilled Fish which happened to be Red Snapper. The presentation of the snapper was really breath taking. The fish came out whole with head and tail and was nicely deboned. The fish was covered in mixture of herbs and pickled cucumbers with charred lemons on the side. This fish itself was really moist and the abundant coating of herbs gave the sweet flesh another subtle dimension of fresh flavour. For rice we went with the Oxtail Basmati Rice. I loved that the rice was topped with the crunchy fried kale and the chunks of oxtail mixed in was so tender and flavourful. Make sure you give this rice a good mix before serving so you get a little bit of everything mixed in.For a side we chose the Roasted Brussel Sprouts with Halloumi cheese. Again such a unique combination of flavours. The crispy halloumi paired so well with the roasted brussel sprouts drizzled with the creamy yogurt sauce we couldn't get enough of them!Although I was stuffed at this point I couldn't resist trying some some there enticing desserts.The Chocolate Mousse was soo creamy and light and not too sweet. I loved the bits of broken baklava to add some crunch and spots of chocolate sauce on plate to intensify the chocolate flavour.Burnt Honey Ice cream had a wonderful roasted honey flavourful with notes of vanilla and topped with a wedge of sponge toffee on top.Turkish Coffee Ice cream was soo creamy and rich with a chocolate base and notes coffee in the background topped with chocolate shavingsFinally I had a Moroccan Mint Tea to wash it all down which had a mild mint flavour served in glass tumbler piping hot with mint leaves floating on top was the perfect way to end a glorious meal.I can totally see why people are flocking here. This meal will definitely go down in one of my top 10 most memorable meals! The service here is top notch and the flavours are so unique and amazing.

As I said in my original review, This was an extraordinary restaurant with the one large shortcoming. Well now this is simply an extraordinary restaurant and I've updated my rating to five stars to reflect such.   The cuisine crafted here is truly cerebral and well planned. I'm always astonished how each element or component on the plate - and often they are  plentiful- all work so well off each other. Many of the pairings and combinations are classical, but some are truly inspired. Everyone nowadays accuses older chefs of overthinking their food, but I don't think it's possible. This kind of careful cooking shows so richly in the final product. Truly, la cuisine soignee. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The food here is extraordinary. I've been to - what in my opinion are the only other restaurants in the city that rival Scaramouche's cuisine and I would still say it's not possible to find this caliber of food anywhere else in Toronto. The quality of the food in both concept and execution is comparable to a one star Michelin restaurant. I've eaten here several dozen times, with different people and its always a safe bet for food. As amazing as the food is, the decor is not. For the most part the center of the dining room is fine and along the window optimal. However there is the most sickening, stomach churning florescent lighting along the back wall. If you happen to be seated facing that wall or your table is DIRECTLY UNDERNEATH that foul lighting....well it's tremendously unpleasant. I don't know who's genius idea it was to put florescent lighting in a fine dining establishment. Furthermore I truly can't  comprehend why anyone would then decide to place tables directly underneath that lighting! Florescent lighting belongs in the back of the house, if anywhere. To reiterate, florescent lighting should NEVER be in a formal dining room! Can I stress this point anymore? Perhaps, if it wasn't for this shortcoming, I would have given the restaurant five stars. Now that I'm done ranting, I'd like to add that the service is good, not to Michelin or classical french standards, but none the less very good. I will continue to dine here every time I'm in town and quite possibly every night I'm in town, providing I'm seated away from the offensive lighting.

Last Saturday was Bremner (see tomorrow's post) in Montreal and today was Buca. If you're not looking for it, you will miss it. It's next to Cheval. In fact, they share the same alleyway. Buca was exactly what I thought it would be.  A clean space with simple details. Special shout out to their light fixture, I loved it.  As those who reviewed before me pointed out, Buca used to be boiler house and you can still see that. It's very industrial with huge ceilings. It's actually basement level but they've opened it up so that a lot of light can shine through. The lunch menu was pretty extensive, and priced average for King West. I hear they vary their lunch menu, although there are few constants, such as the rosemary, garlic bread knots.Service was slow to start, but got stellar and stayed that way throughout our long lunch.  Olive Ascolane - fried olives stuffed with lamb sausage - crunchy, salty and tangy.Pizza, sadly, I don't remember what this was called, but it had smoked buffalo cheese, chilies, and the day's cured meats.  It was spicy, salty, and smoky. Bigoli - homemade pasta with duck egg and a duck ragù with mascarpone and basil.  OMG. I loved this dish. The portion is small, but lest we forget, we on King West.  Course if it were a little bigger, I would say I superloved it. And of course, dessert:Pannacotta with kiwi berries. KIWI BERRIES?!?! I Googled it because I've never heard of such a thing, much less tasted such a thing. I had to know more. Their proper term is actinidia arguta, or hard kiwi. Apparently it is native to Korea (amongst other countries). They are really delicious, and I think I love them. It was a proper pannacotta. I can't tell you how many times I've ordered it at a restaurant and been served messed up pudding. This was creamy, delicately flavoured and delicious. The tart tasted exactly how it smelled - amazing.  Sweet gelati, maple syrup and pistachios added textures to the delicate tart and pumpkin filling.If I had to choose the best dish of the day, I would go with the bigoli and the pannacotta.  The bread knots are also well-known but I think I want to try the pig ears next time. Word of warning, Buca doesn't serve complimentary bread, which may be why people like the knots so much. If you have to pay for bread, why not getting something more creative. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2418, 2432)",1,0.0,False

The skewers tasted great and it came with peanut sauce and a sweet/vinegar based dip with thai chili's inside. The peanut sauce was well made and authentic instead of taking a glop of peanut butter and blending it with some hot sauce. The vinegar based sauce tasted great as well and my friend practically drank the sauce. The pad thai tasted as expected, the portion wasn't too big, but satisfying. A good mix of chicken, sprouts and everything else evenly throughout. Nothing stood out from it and the foreigner spicy translated to mild. The Gaeng Hunglay was something else though, think curry, but a little sweeter and hints of ginger. I thoroughly enjoyed that dish more then the pad thai Thai cuisine doesn't have a lot of expensive ingredients, the pad thai costs around 15$ and it wasn't special or outstanding enough for me to order it again.

I've been wanting to try this place since it opened and luckily I was able to find someone who was yet to have tried it.  Thanks for coming with me Justine H! In a nutshell, this place is like Oktoberfest, and now you can have it everyday at Wvrst!Wvrst  definitely has flavours of a European sausage and beer hall, and really reminded me of Oktoberfest (except nicer). It's spacious and dimly lit with with ceiling strung lights --a casually comfortable place.Wvrst MenuScattered around the hall tables were these long sheets of recycled paper which would be the menu. If you're looking for something other than fries, sausages, and alcohol, you're probably at the wrong place. The menu is simple, but the numerous options lie in the type of each you fancy.At the back of the establishment there is a long open space that leads up to a rather small counter where you order and pay. I imagine this empty space is filled up by a line up during busier lunch hours. It wasn't too bad on the Tuesday night that we went.Sausage Display CaseThe display case is neatly organized with all the different sausages that they have. If you're in the mood for some exotic meats, then you're in luck. They have everything from kangaroo to venison, rabbit to guinea fowl. Justine H and I weren't too appetized looking at it, but after we managed to get over its appearance we went up to the counter to order.DrinksThey have quite a number of beers here, bottled and on tap. Definitely not as many as a place like Beer Bistro might have, but more than just your commonly seen brews. Justine opted for the San Pellegrino Orange, and me an Austrailian beer Stiegl. Figured it was only fitting that I had a beer in the given setting!Bratwvrst ($6) -Veal, Pork, and WineDuck ($9) -Maple and Fois GrasThese contemporary European sausages for the most part were quite good. Juicy and full of flavour. Didn't feel like I was eating a super artificial chunk of meat like I do having hot dogs from street vendors. In terms of flavour, I think it really depends on the sausage you order. You could definitely taste the fois gras in the Duck sausage, which was something Justine H didn't enjoy too much. I didn't mind it and found it to be an interesting combination, but I definitely liked the Bratwvrst more. I'd like to add that these sausages are quite small, and even with my small appetite I was unsatisfied having just the one hot dog.Duck Fat Fries ($4.50)Lots of other food enthusiasts raved about these fries, so we ordered a serving to share. Perhaps it was the heightened expectations from all the amazing reviews, but these duck fat fries fell just a bit short. They were full bodied, thick, and buttery, but they just weren't amazing. To be honest, I couldn't differentiate what difference the duck fat had on the fries compared to the ones made in regular oil. The order of fries comes with one dipping sauce, and the Wvrst Spicy we chose was great. Definitely not the best fries I've had, but they are quite tasty still, and would easily satisfy those random starchy fry cravings.One last thing to note, is that they are big on leafs games here! They have a ticket giveaway at around 6:30pm the night of every Leaf's game at the Air Canada Center. With TV's all around the dining hall and tables that encourage conversation, it would be a great place to go catch the game along with a couple of drinks. But be warned, it might get pretty rowdy later in the night with cheering Leafs fans who've had a couple drinks or two! ANSWERNOTFOUND",the different sausages that they have,"(1237, 1274)",2,0.6,True

Facility: Fairly small, almost always packed, very little waiting room. The corridor fits only about 5 people before it starts feeling cramped, then you'll have to stand outside. Floor to ceiling windows and an open kitchen. Washrooms are nice but TINY. Anyone taller than 5'9 may have to duck.Food Quality & Price: Meat was soft and tender. I was impressed by the presence of crunchy bamboo shoots and black fungus in my shio ramen. The egg was also very well done, marinated just right with a yolky middle that wasn't cold at all. I personally didn't like that the default noodles were so thin (almost like instand noodles), but they were cooked well enough. The regular/small size is a decent portion and really hit the spot. The only negatives about this ramen is that there is noticeable MSG in the soup base and it is very salty. While I don't doubt that the soup has been simmering for days, I think it would be just fine without MSG. You can ask for LESS salt and LESS fat, but I'm reviewing the default dish that you get without customization. Service: Good service with a smile from both the ladies and the gents. Fast, and checked in on us just the right amount of times. Didn't feel rushed.Overall: I would return to Santouka if I was in the area. I do believe that Santouka caters to general ramen eater who prefer a great deal of flavour and artificiality in their soups. So while it appeals to the masses, I find that it's a bit of a cop out. While the location boasts of Japanese locals seeking out their establishment, I think it's just a matter of decent food at a prime location. They earned a solid 4 stars but could improved by automatically reducing the amount of salt and removing MSG from their soup. ANSWERNOTFOUND",nice,"(436, 440)",2,1.0,True

I loved the soup, it came out over a candle to keep it hot, served with a side of rice. It came with two jumbo shrimp and some onions and mushrooms. You can definitely taste the fish sauce, which I love in Asian cuisines. It was definitely a cozy and super tasty dish. However, I was very disappointed in the service we received from our waitress, and am very displeased to say that the kitchen staff who brought out our food was far more helpful than our actual waitress. We were seated and were waiting for one friend, but we knew what they wanted, so we waited for our waitress to come around to at least order our drinks, but she didnt for 15 mins and we had to flag her down, which she did not seem happy about. My boyfriend had asked her what was on tap, and she rudely replied with What? along with a displeased look. After ordering our drinks, she went off when we wanted to order our food as well, so we gave her a few minutes to punch in orders, tend other tables. We ended up waiting another 10 minutes and had to flag her down again, still seemed unhappy with asking her to take our order. When my friend had noted that he had a peanut allergy and asked if there was any nuts in his dishes, she once again seemed displeased to be asked a question. It took about 20 minutes to receive our food, and some of it was cold, where as the table behind us who had sat down and order after us began receiving their food within 5 minutes of ordering. Not even once during our meal did she ask if our meal was okay or if we wanted more water, we actually had to ask a different staff member to help us out. Another thing I kind of found work inappropriate was what one of the servers was wearing (btw I am in no way shaming this server or have any problems with what she was wearing but in no way do I or many others find it workplace appropriate in a restaurant for families...) but she was wearing a VERY sheer top, without anything under and you could clearly see her nipples, mind you I'm ok with that, but I'm not so sure families with younger children would be okay with that. In the end, we received our bill from our waitress, who yet once again seemed so annoyed with us, we saw that we had a 20% service charge. I'm okay with paying a service charge, since we did have 6 people, but I don't really think that our server deserved the 20% since her coworkers were waiting our table for her. Overall, the food is pretty good, a little bit on the pricier side for the portion you receive but the quality is there, but I don't mind as there aren't many good Thai restaurants in Toronto. i loved the atmosphere and vibe they had going on. Honestly, the service we received was definitely subpar, but i am willing to give them another chance because everyone does have their off day, just hoping to be served by a different waitress next time. @eatingwithv ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3081, 3095)",5,0.0,False

It is named after an actual road in Bangkok, Thailand and its name means milled rice referencing a time when the street was a major rice market.  Now it is a haven for backpackers and buzzing with nightlife - akin to Mongkok in Hong Kong.While the original chef, Nuit Regular (Sabai Sabai + Sukhothai) has since left, the food is still yummy.  While most Thai places offer up ketchupy versions of pad thai and curries so thick of coconut milk that you taste nothing else - you can taste the difference at Khao San Road.  We try to order our ingredients from Thailand whenever possible, says owner Monte Wan because slight nuances in the flavour of tamarind (Thai vs. local) makes a difference.   KSR wants to be as Thai as possible.The Thai iced tea is reminiscent of Vietnamese coffee and is a refreshing and delicious drink to quench summer thirst - if you can get past the sugar rush!  The drink is made of a blend of Thai spices and black tea with condensed milk.  Unfortunately it comes pre-mixed, so no fancy, customized orders à la Starbucks here.  Everyone gets the same.The garlic tofu is delicious.  I haven't tasted tofu like this anywhere else.  Incredibly smooth on the inside and breaded in a crispy garlic and kaffir lime coating with a sweet and tangy sauce.  If ever there were a vegetarian equivalent to chicken nuggets - this would be it.The fresh rolls here, again share similarities with Vietnamese cuisine.  But those on a low-carb diet will be happy about the absence of vermicelli noodles.  It's packed with carrots, lettuce, Thai basil, mint leaves and a housemade chicken sausage.  The tamarind sauce topped with peanuts is a welcome addition though the rolls are flavourful in their own right.Continuing on with the sweet and tangy with a bit of heat is the Tom Yam Soup, the Thai version of a hot and sour soup which has much more complex flavors from lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, galangal, lime juice, fish sauce, and crushed chili peppers.  I'd choose this over hot chocolate on a cold, winter's day.The squash fritters are starchy and sweet like sweet potato fries and is a great nosh.The crispy rice salad is not yet on the menu but will be coming soon to a table near you.  It is a cold rice salad that has the texture of delicious rice crusts that form at the bottom of Korean/Chinese clay pot rice (usually the best part).  It is sprinkled with thin slices of ginger which add heat and topped with scallions.Those who can't handle the heat had better stay away from the Kua Ging Pork; curried minced pork with kaffir lime + house made curry paste. The kicker are the peppercorns.  You definitely feel the burn!The Gaeng Kaew Wan (green curry) with shrimp gets its color from the green chillies and is topped with bamboo shoots, Thai basil + kaffir lime leaves.  As with all of the KSR curries, definitely opt for a bowl of white rice to sop up all the delicious flavors!An all-time crowd-favorite and one of my own personal favorites is the khao soi; egg noodles in a coconut milk enriched curry, garnished with crispy noodles, green onion, coriander + lime. The beef version is their signature, though you can opt for chicken as well.  I love the textural differences in the noodles.Two different kinds of pad thai are available; the street-style and KSR's chef's special topped with crushed peanuts, dried chili and freshly squeezed lime juice.  Khao San Road doesn't take reservations, though the food comes out pretty fast so the turnover is quick.  If you want to avoid waiting then I suggest going right when they open (which at lunch is 11:30am and 5pm for dinner).  While there are many restaurants in the city that adhere to this no reservations policy that are so overrated and totally not worth it - Khao San Road is worth the wait.*This meal was complimentary, all opinions expressed are my own* ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3994, 4008)",5,0.0,False

The large selection is about the only good thing about this particular restaurant. Which isn't especially saying much since the large selection comes with the large prices, with most entrees looking to put you back $15-30.The service... I don't even know why they bother hiring the hostess (VERY loosely used term) upstairs because she's obviously there for show. The last two times I've entered through the upstairs entrance I had to wait for the hostesses (these were two different people by the way) to finish texting before telling me to walk downstairs and through the restaurant in order to have the downstairs hostess put my party on a list for a table.I can deal with that, just enter through the downstairs entrance through the Atrium, better service. Once in the basement though, which is sort of drab, dreary and just uncomfortable as fine dining atmospheres go, all the waiters I've had have been excellent.Now the food... All I can say is mediocre at best.Their calamari is decent as a large appetizer. Yet beware, their batter is incredibly rich and takes on a lot of oil (over-fried) so expect to feel some bloating.I personally had their eggs benedict today which was horrendous. If you want a benedict, go somewhere else (yes, even Golden Griddle who had a surprisingly good benedict last time I dropped by). Eggs were overcooked and didn't seem like they were freshly made, the bacon was obviously heatlamped, and the english muffin tasted stale. The only good point of the breakfast was the potato latke which was nothing like a latke and was more like a hashbrown, yet it tasted good, albeit a little salty.

Our waiter came quickly, was very friendly, and took his time to explain the menu to us as it was our first time there. We started off with Aburi Beef Carpaccio, which was awesome! I loved the shoyu eggs, it was perfectly cooked. The baby green and pear complimented the beef very nicely (although a lot less greens would have been good). The beef carpaccio itself was amazing, it melted in my mouth and was packed with flavour! We then had the Kaisan Soba, which was basically a seafood soba. You can choose to get it mild or spicy. I got it spicy, which I thought was a very nice kick, I didn't find it too spicy. I was surprised with the generous amount of seafood that came with the soba. There were clams, mussles, prawns, scallop and squid. The seafood were all huge, and super fresh. The soba had a very nice texture to it, definitely one of the best soba I've had. Keep in mind this isn't your traditional soba dish though, it seemed a bit more stir fried. Anyways, overall it was super yummy!Miku is known for their Oshi Sushi (aka the blow torch pressed sushi), so I definitely had to try that. I had the salmon and mackerel. Both were amazing! The rice was very sweet and soft. And both the salmon and mackerel were torched perfectly. The salmon sushi came with a small jalapeno on top, which adds a bit of a kick to it. My husband really liked that touch, I personally took it off before eating the sushi. We also ordered the Miku roll, which was to die for. This roll literally melts in your mouth. What I loved the most about it is that there was such a thin layer of rice around the roll, with each bit, I mostly just tasted the salmon and uni and tobiko, which was awesome!!!

The restaurant was dimly lit with rustic lighting and candles, which were a lovely touch. The tables were wooden, and again, went with that rustic feel. Everything was just amazing. I think I'm doing a horrible job at describing this place and I'm not doing it any justice, so just pay them a visit.Second, and the most important, was the food. I needed to be wheeled out of here when I was done. Here's a rundown of what we ordered:-Fresh Mozzarella with Pingue Prosciutto: the crostinis were really good, as was the fig jam, sea salt, proscuitto and the cheese of course. We also asked for a side of the tomato jam which went well with the cheese. I suggest spreading some fig jam on the crostini, sprinkling some sea salt on it, then topping it off with some cheese. It was sooo good!-Straight up meatball: We just had the classic meatball. I'm not a huge fan of beef or any type of ground up meat, but this meatball was delicious! It was doused in tomato sauce and cheese and sat atop a piece of bread... it was just so good-Bianca Pizza: I thought this pizza was really good... and it was... until about a few slices in. This pizza, in theory, is really yummy- the caramelized onions add a bit of sweetness and the tomatoes, a bit of tang, but the herbs and overkill of parmesan cheese made it just a slight bit too salty for my friends' and I's liking.Sidenote: We let the waitress know when she asked us how we liked the food and she was nice enough to take the pizza off the bill... Grade A customer service.-Chocolate panna cotta: I really wanted to love this, and I did love it for a few bites, until the balsamic flavor became too much to handle. The chocolate of the panna cotta was done well- it wasn't too sweet and it wasn't dull, but the balsamic flavor became very overpowering after a few bites. It added a nice tang in the beginning, but after, that's all you seem to taste.-Tiramisu: delicious... simply delicious. The espresso flavor really came through on this one-Zeppole: Yum! Who doesn't like dough balls and chocolate?-Blood orange and cucumber mojito: mojito done to the next level. It's a regular mojito that tastes so much better than a regular mojito. Sooo good. I will never drink regular mojitos again.Overall, I had an awesome time here. Our waitress was amazing. She gave us tons of suggestions and was very knowledgable about the menu. All of the staff members who came by our table were really nice and friendly- especially the hostess who stood by the door and brought us over to our table. I will, most definitely, be back for another visit. Everything was great! P.S. We were told by our waitress that there is a live DJ on Thurs, Fri, and Sat nights! and $7 cocktails and $5 pints!

Some people prefer the noodles to be more chewy, some prefer a more egg-y flavour, some like a flavourful broth and some prefer it light. It's hard for everyone to agree on what's the best ramen shop in the world - my personal favourite is Sansotei, but Santouka is not a bad choice either.I love ramen but I find that I can only eat so much of it before I get tired of the taste. Ramen tends to be a bit too salty for me so after a bowl of it I get enough of the taste and often crave something else to offset the salt - usually it's gyoza but my personal preference is a rice dish, and this is Santouka's advantage over many other ramen shops nearby.You can order a combo of ramen and a rice dish (I recommend the salmon), and the rice helps offset the saltiness of the ramen. The two together in my opinion makes a much better meal overall than just the ramen itself. I also find that I need about 1.5 ramen to feel satiated (don't judge) so the rice usually hits the spot. I do not recommend getting the karameshi though, I did not like it at all. The rest were alright but salmon is definitely #1.Now of course because this is a ramen shop, their ramen has to be given more weight in the review. I think for me, the broth is a little too salty. Yes, I know Shio ramen in the picture literally translates to salt ramen, but I've tried all their broth flavours and they've all been consistently salty. If you like stronger flavours, then this ramen joint should be perfect for you. Other than that though, everything else is pretty spot on.I usually drop by during off-hours but I was craving ramen so badly I came on a Saturday night. I had to wait in a fairly long line but the line moves quicker than you'd expect because ramen really doesn't take long to eat. The service was quick and efficient and they get the job done well. The seating arrangement also doesn't feel crowded even though they do try and squeeze a lot of people in.My one minor critique in terms of service is that they should have the condiments labeled. That red sauce they give you with the gyoza is not vinegar, it's chilli oil. It's impossible to tell from just looking at the bottle.Overall, this is a pretty decent ramen joint that you'd probably be happy with. There's a lot of competition nearby, but in my view they still stand near the top from the rest. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2481, 2495)",5,0.0,False

We were finally seated, but again the owner came over to our table to tell us that we didn't have a reservation and basically called us a liar. We asked him what he would like us to do - we already had appetizers on the table, so he told us to stay (so what was the point of him harassing us again?). The bill came and our drinks were not taken off the bill. We called the two co-owners over and they told us we all must have misheard and that had never said anything like that. Blatant lie.

But given that we had theater tickets one Friday night, the time was finally right to sample Byblos' much-ballyhooed wares.We arrived at around 6:15 and we promptly shown to our reserved table near the front. Our very helpful waitress appeared shortly after and we began the slow process of figuring out just what to eat. We ultimately chose six items:Duck Kibbeh (dried fig + date molasses + tahini): This was easily the highlight of the entire meal. I've eaten plenty of kibbeh over my lifetime but this is unquestionably the tastiest version of this venerable dish I've ever had. Everything was perfect, from the delectable spices to the unctuous, melt-in-your-mouth meat to the note-perfect sauce. Just astounding.Spanish Octopus (fingerling potato + biber chili vinaigrette + preserved lemon): Although the octopus was cooked about as well as I've ever had it - the octopus at Bar Isabel, for example, was far chewier - there was nothing about this dish that really stood out. Perhaps it's because it came on the heels of the sublime Duck Kibbeh, but there was nothing here that really blew me away in terms of flavor - although the presentation was quite nice.Sujuk Pide (turkish paste + persian feta + za'atar): I'm a big fan of sujuk (a spicy Middle Eastern sausage), so I was especially excited about this one. It's very good. All the components work extremely well together and the enveloping crust is baked perfectly. I suppose my one complaint is the sujuk itself, which, in addition to not tasting like any sujuk I've ever had, is completely lacking in the heat I've come to associate with the sausage.Mejadra (lentil + hung yogurt + fried shallot): Again, this is something I've been eating my entire life and I have to say, unfortunately, that this dish just didn't measure up. Despite the aforementioned dollop of yogurt, the rice is just dry as heck. It's been cooked in a skillet, which allows the side and bottom rice to get crispy - an idea which sounds great in theory but doesn't really work here. Far more problematic is the fried shallot on top. Traditionally, the shallots (or onions) are taken beyond the point of caramelization, which lends the dish a rich flavor that's unfortunately completely absent here. This was definitely the biggest disappointment for me.Seared Cauliflower (duck fat + tahini sauce + sesame + coriander): This is a very tasty side that's almost workmanlike in its execution. It's well done but it's nothing special, sadly.Turkish Manti Dumplings (smokey eggplant + yogurt sauce + molasses): This incredibly rich dish admittedly goes well with the Mejadra, as it cuts that dryness I mentioned. But it might be just a little too rich; between the heavy yogurt sauce and the sweet molasses, it's impossible to taste the smokey eggplant supposedly contained within the dumplings.All in all, I quite enjoyed my meal at Byblos. The ambiance is inviting, the service is flawless, and the food is, for the most part, quite above average. And I'd sure as heck go back just to eat that Duck Kibbeh again.

The pad thai was greasy and delicious, I like how they put a twist on the standard pad thai (noodles+sauce made it a bit soggy but i think that was on purpose because it tasted awesome).

You pay 20$+ for them and they are about the size of a medium pizzas, all arrived burnt and chewy. Toppings were sparingly placed. Honestly I could get a better pizza at pizza hut which is pretty good for a fast food place.   I ordered the Pappardalle Alla Iosa as my main dish. Presentation of the dish was great, but I was underwhelmed with the portion size of the dish. As well, it was good but nothing exceptional. It felt like something I could make at home using store-bought noodles. Our second server who replaced the original server was great and very attentive. Our water glasses were kept filled and she even brought extra chili flakes after noticing that we used it all! She was the saving grace for otherwise a mediocre experience..

A creamy lobster dish, some exceptional short ribs and some phenomenal Israeli couscous (and Brussels sprouts with haloumi cheese and bacon!!!) and we were pretty much stuffed, but James the host also provided us with three small desserts that were also fantastic.

These businesses are completely sustained by IG-'foodies'.Anyways, I don't know too much about Pablo - other than it being a Japanese chain that specializes in cheesetarts.  I didn't really have interest, but the lady wanted to try it out and there were no lineups.We got a full size cheese tart for around $15 and it was about 8.  The texture of the filling is similar to flan or pudding - taste was very light (not eggy or cheesy at all).  Most of the flavour comes from the apricot topping.  The crust was pretty flaky.  Neither of us will try it again - just not a great value proposition (their 'premium' cheese tart is the same size but $25 with a creme brulee topping).Although not the same, Uncle Tetsu is probably their nearest competitor (geographically and figuratively).  I'm not a huge fan of sweets, so I do prefer the more subtle taste and better texture of Tetsu's 'cheesecake' (which I probably won't have again anytime soon either).  However, with Tetsu, it's hard to find a good substitute -- with Pablo, I rather have a good Chinese egg tart or a Portuguese egg tart... and I won't have to pay $15 - $25 for either.

We were greeted by a hostess who told us that the wait time to get a table is about 30 minutes. When we told her there are plenty of empty tables, she said that there are people ahead of us on the waiting list, when clearly there was nobody around waiting to be called! As a matter of fact, we saw a guy who came and told her that they never called his name and he got angry when she said she had called his name and there was no response.My boyfriend did not like her attitude and neither did I.

Well, the kind of party that involves food, that is.Before we begin, let me educate you on the pronunciation of this place - read Verst. And its exact English translation is non other than sausage (figures). This recently opened spot in the heart of King West has been successfully luring in lunch crowds. With its sausage hall concept, breadth of sausage styles and flavours and an impressive local and imported beer menu; Wvrst has quickly become a favourite in the area and the Friday lunch go-to place for most of us.Their dedication to the core product, sausages; its one to admire. All sausages are freshly made on the premises and cooked when ordered. When you arrive at Wvrst, you right away notice a large line up of people (mostly men...I did say it was a sausage party) staring at the menu, asking the staff for advice and at times drinking beer while waiting in line. Because this is a sausage hall, once your food is ordered, you are given a number which then lets the waiters know which table to bring the food to. One thing you will notice is that because the line-ups are long, the waiters are extremely diligent in cleaning up the tables, so don't feel like they are rushing you, they are just doing their job and are very pleasant.Now, lets talk about the product. From the list, my favourite is the Venison style sausage. Given that its flavour is more on the smokey, nutty and hearty side, it makes it a great pairing with just about any topping. You can choose 2 out of 4 toppings - Caramelized Onions, Sauerkraut, Sweet Peppers and Sautéed Jalapeños. The roll used to wrap these juicy meats around is something worth mentioning, being on the rather soft side, this roll is lightly sweet with a hint of sourdough style bread, a great choice. Note to reader: you can also order a whole wheat roll and choice of veggie or chicken sausage options.Another one of Wvrst's hits is their Duck Fat Fries. Fried in duck fat as opposed to regular oil, the fries tend to be softer and buttery, while maintaining a great consistency on the surface. How this is done? A two step frying process. Double-dipping is what I would name this frying method. The outcome? Buttery and flavourful french fries. But the goodness does not end here, on top of having great tasting fries, Wvrst offers you a selection of dipping sauces. My favourite, and one that I can not live without, the Mojito sauce. Dip your fries in it or add it to your sausage party, either way you in are in for a heck of a tasty treat.Until next time Foodies!Buen Provecho,Viviana.

My wife made reservations for two on a Saturday evening. From the door at the main entrance I was amazed. We walked in, the staff took us to our table and sat us down. We ordered our appetizers and dinner at the same time after taking in the view and deciding from the excellent menu options. To our surprise the dinner and the appetizers came out at the same time. It was weird at first but then all we had to do was request that the appetizers come out before the main course. So that wasn't a big deal for us and we didn't mind at all. The food was very delicious.The restaurant becomes a lounge with good music as the evening progresses. There is a lounge area that has beautiful couches and throw pillows where you can enjoy drinks with friends in a great ambiance. All in all, a great dining experience with great service.

I was extremely excited, and rightfully so. This restaurant has a fancy upscale vibe to it and looks stunning on both the inside and outside. The atmosphere is perfect for a celebration, but still OK for a casual meal. I came mainly to try the aburi sushi, and it truly was the highlight of my dinner!The service was GREAT. Everyone was so polite and friendly from the moment we walked in to when we walked out. The servers are incredibly attentive and the food expeditors really make sure to describe what your dish is made out of as they come out. I really liked the detail in these descriptions. The place is pricey, but it's worth it for the quality of food and service. Overall, I had an amazing time at Miku!Here is a small breakdown of what I ordered and my thoughts on it:Albacore Tuna and Wakame Tartare ($18) - thought this tasted pretty good. The tuna was fresh, and it came with avocados which is my favourite. It was a cool item to try, but I probably wouldn't buy it again.Salmon Oshi Sushi ($17) - this was the best part of my dinner and I would honestly come back just to buy this again. I absolutely love it! And you probably won't be able to find aburi sushi like this in Toronto (other than at JaBistro).Red Wave Roll ($18) & Miku Roll ($22) - got 1/2 of each. Both were must haves!! I personally enjoyed the red wave roll much more though (not a big fan of uni, but I LOVE tuna). Aburi Sushi Sampler ($20) - perfect dish to start off with because you get to try a variety of different things! I'd totally recommend this to anyone who's in for trying something new.Atlantic Salmon Sashimi (6 pieces for $16) - salmon sashimi has always been one of my favourite things to eat, but I didn't find anything too special about the sashimi here. Tasted great, fresh, but not TO DIE FOR or anything like that! Just average.Uni (Sea Urchin) and Cho Toro (Tuna Belly) at market prices - I LOVED the tuna so much!! I want to go back just to have more! Didn't enjoy the uni at all though. It was my first time trying it, and it tastes extremely seafoody! It's a bit of an acquired taste and was certainly not right for me.Green Tea Opera Dessert ($13) - the green tea ice cream tasted pretty regular to me, but the CAKE with many layers to it was absolutely delicious!

Settled with a 6:30 pm slot on a Monday evening and although it was relatively busy, you could probably take your chances doing a walk-in on a weekday.Contemporary decor but still had a very classy vibe. Lamb Ribs ($14) - These were delicious but tiny!! 3.5 small lamb ribs (the 4th one was more like a twig with barely any meat) that are tender, mildly flavored with a crispy texture. Not exactly the best value but taste-wise, 4/5  Roasted Red Beets ($13) - I debated whether or not to order this dish pretty much until the very last minute when I decided to just take a leap of faith and trust my fellow Yelpers. So glad I did as it was the highlight of the night. I was hesitant because my boyfriend and I aren't the greatest fan of red beets but you can hardly taste it when mixed with the labneh which had the perfect consistency and creaminess. Served with some delicious barbari bread, this dish is one you don't want to pass up on. 5/5Crispy Squid ($13) - This one was a decent portion but the individual pieces of squid are very small. Lightly fried and the spices and garlic sauce (toum) give it a nice kick. Very flavorful dish overall and tasted great with our rice. Probably one of the least traditional items because frankly, it's basically calamari with some Eastern Mediterranean seasonings. But I wasn't there to judge (nor would I know) how authentic their food was, so 3.5/5 Turkish Manti Dumplings ($14) - I was looking forward to this the most but it ended up being the biggest disappointment of the night. Such a shame. The dumplings were underwhelming to say the least. I actually didn't even know they were filled with eggplant until the fourth one or so because the ones I ate prior had nothing in it. The molasses balanced the yogurt really well but other than that, nothing special. 2/5Tartufata ($30) - Probably the most expensive rice I've ever had.The truffle and mushrooms were decadent and the fried chick peas were amazing. Crispy and flavorful. The rice itself is very ordinary. So all things considered, I can't say it was completely worth it. I wouldn't order it again because I'd like to try their other rice offerings which looked and sounded just as appealing. 4/5Seared Cauliflower ($8) - It's considered to be a side so I'd recommend ordering this with one of their meat dishes (ribeye, lamb shoulder, etc.) because I think it'd compliment it quite well. We just thought cauliflower with duck fat sounded awesome so we couldn't resist and ordered it anyway. I prefer stronger flavors so I loved this but heads up it can be a bit heavy. 4/5As for dessert, we had the Loukmades ($12) - Fantastic! We were pretty full and while waiting, we kept negotiating how many bites each person would take to finish it. Ended up fighting over the last piece. Pretty much burnt honey icecream on a krispy kreme donut (but a different shape). So good and a must-order!! 5/5  Service was lackluster.  Our server was kind and filled our water pretty often but eventually disappeared. We found ourselves waiting a lot - to order dessert, to ask for the bill and to pay. Service shouldn't end after the customer finishes their main course but rather when they walk out the door. Also, typical of many high-end restaurants, they explain what's in every dish but it was spewed out so quickly that a lot of it was incoherent. Didn't really add any value to our dinner.  A little overhyped but I'd come back because their menu still has a few other interesting items I'd like to try. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone who's looking to celebrate a special occasion or somewhere nice to go for a first date. Just don't expect to be blown away.

On Saturday we waited for about an hour after showing up at 8pm and on Wednesday we showed up at 7pm and got a table right away. The service here is excellent!!!

The food is also excellent. The calamari is to die for. The Caesar salad is really good...not all creamy like some places. The meat and cheese board is also amazing and it's a must if you go with enough people. I had the pasta with breaded cauliflower and it was so so so good. It tasted even better the next day as leftovers. For dessert we had the tiramisu and the trio of gelato (vanilla, chocolate and pistachio) all super yummy. I'm preggo right now so I can't speak to the wine, but they do have a wide selection including some reasonably priced options. In addition, the restaurant is decorated very nicely with some antique pieces and the washrooms are super clean and have the smallest, cutest sinks I've ever seen.

The place fills up real quick during the nights and the night I came had many tables reserved. The food portions are adequate and fills you up without leaving too heavy of an after taste. The flavor pairings of the dishes were very well though out beginning with waitress' recommendation of fig salad; the herbs and leafs in this was so fresh I almost felt like I was eating it straight from the plant. The sauces and seasoning was so eloquently used that everything balanced out so well, not ashamed to say that I quickly chowed down the entire plate in mere seconds. Next I had the crispy squid, similar to calamari but a little lighter and smaller tentacles. Also had the steak tartare paired with greek yogurt (they call it labneh) which melted in your mouth, albeit being a little plain. The lamb rib felt a little stingy; each bone was probably one bite-size, nothing special.Probably the best dish tonight was the oxtail basmati rice, a little on the heavy size, it was aromatic, creamy and rich. The flavour of the oxtail was imbued into each scoop of the yellow golden rice, while the kale offered a variation in texture with every mouthful. This I am definitely coming back for.To finish had the chocolate mousse and burnt honey ice cream. Mousse was typical, but the ice cream was interesting - I actually don't know how they got that flavour so on point! Must try (and it's only $3).An amazing discovery I had tonight was dukkah: crushed hazelnuts, coriander seeds, sesame seeds, cumin. The texture and aroma of this garnish is addictive, and Byblos isn't afraid to abuse their dukkah. I left craving for more, and now I'm in the search for making some at home.

Facility: Fairly small, almost always packed, very little waiting room. The corridor fits only about 5 people before it starts feeling cramped, then you'll have to stand outside. Floor to ceiling windows and an open kitchen. Washrooms are nice but TINY. Anyone taller than 5'9 may have to duck.Food Quality & Price: Meat was soft and tender. I was impressed by the presence of crunchy bamboo shoots and black fungus in my shio ramen. The egg was also very well done, marinated just right with a yolky middle that wasn't cold at all. I personally didn't like that the default noodles were so thin (almost like instand noodles), but they were cooked well enough. The regular/small size is a decent portion and really hit the spot. The only negatives about this ramen is that there is noticeable MSG in the soup base and it is very salty.
