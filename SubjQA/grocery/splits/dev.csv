Still, this is not bad as a snack food for when you're not home. Because they are individually wrapped, you could easily toss one into the lunch box. Inside, you'll find two tasty crackers and reasonably good cheese.Judging by the nutrional statement, this product is aimed at someone who cares about fat, calories, sodium, and cholesterol. You would not want to eat a package of them, but one is reasonable as a snack. I judge the nutrition as approaching reasonably healthy crackers (like ak-nak) and fresh cheese, and less chemicals than I expected for packaged food.CRACKERRitz has their name from crackers, but these aren't your father's Ritz crackers. They are made with whole grains, and probably less fat than regular Ritz crackers. They have 8g whole grain per packet. ak-nak (a popular low-fat, organically grown whole wheat cracker) is about 11g whole grain for two crackers. The daily recommended amount is 48g, so this does contribute meaningfully.The cracker by itself tastes good, has a nice crunch, and if it was available without the cheese, is good enough for me to consider getting as a cracker for a party.CHEESEI was suspicious about cheese for this product that is made to go without refrigeration. Well, it tastes like cheese, because that seems to be mostly what is in it. The filling is made with semisoft cheese, two kinds of cheddar (well, cheddar is listed twice), and some asiago. It does not have the smooth texture of conventional cheese, but it does taste good.NUTRITIONThe packet of two crackers with cheese weighs 1 ounce, and has 130 calories per packet, 7g fat (11% of daily value), 210 mg salt (11%), Cholesterol &lt;5mg (1%). As a comparison, 1 ounce of potato chips we have show 140 calories, 8g fat, 400 mg salt, so the crackers are somewhat better in all ways except the cheese has cholesterol and the chips do not.The package I received had an expiration date about 4 months out, and this is a new product, so they don't put enough chemicals in them to give them a long shelf life. The listed chemicals are sodium phosphate (probably used as a preservative for the cheese), and tricalcium phosphate (an anti-caking agent, the same chemical that our bones and teeth are made of). I looked both up on the Web and did not see anything bad about their use.Corn syrup is one of the ingredients. There must not be a lot, since this product is not sweet.PACKAGINGWorth mentioning, especially if you intend to buy on the Web and have delivered. It came in a bubble-wrap bag, and the package inside was crushed. However, the individual packets have u-shaped cardboard to protect the crackers from breakage, and only two were broken, and they were broken in half (not into many pieces).OVERALLThese are better than I expected, both in nutrition and in taste.

I used to be a subscriber to their coffee service and would look forward to my monthly shipments. For the most part their coffee is simply stellar. This coffee smells delicious out of the package, and while brewing, but the chocolate taste is too much for my palate. Never thought I would say that something is too chocolatey but this is! If you are a choco-holic this might be the perfect coffee for you. It is a chocolate truffle so I guess it is to be expected.Update to this review:A couple of weeks later I returned to this coffee. But with one difference. I halved the amount of coffee I brewed with and voila! The flavors came right out in a very pleasant way. The mistake was definitely mine. I like my coffee strong yet I was defintely making this coffee too strong! I say, if you love chocolate and coffee you should give this a shot but make it with about half of what you use to make regular old coffee. The flavors just come right out in a balanced way. My original review was three stars, I have upgraded to four. Could be a 4.5. I would definitely buy this coffee again.I have written many reviews and have never updated one. I was so surprised by how good this coffee turned out that I felt impelled to re-write my review.

No, I am really, really serious about it! Not the coffee shop $5 a piece kind - the ones you buy in glass bottles or cans. When I say ""connoisseur"", I mean drinking one almost every day for the past eight years kind of connoisseur. Having stopped drinking one popular brand, and not being able to find a substitute - I ended up resorting to blending my own. However, this completely killed the portability that I loved, as well as the ability to grab one our the fridge and head out the door.Then I was asked to try this brand. Let me just say I am immediately putting this on ""subscribe and save"" for a monthly delivery.What makes it good is its balanced flavor. You know you are drinking coffee, not chocolate milk someone put into a used coffee cup. Not black coffee some tried to flavor a bit too late with a sugar bomb. This drink is well blended and the flavors are well balanced.While I absolutely appreciate they kept calories down (100 calories a serving) - I think they accomplished this by using quite a few ""ingredients"", many I needed to look up to see exactly what they were.

I happen to like black cherry as a flavor for beverages, so keep that in mind as you read this review.FLAVOR:The beverage was sweet, but not overly sweet, and not at all tart.  It tasted similar to other black cherry carbonated drinks I've had.  I would compare it in taste to Knudsen's Black Cherry Spritzer with Switch being a tad more ""soda"" tasting.  It is much lighter tasting than actual black cherry sodas I've had, such as Dr. Brown's.INGREDIENTS:The Switch is advertised as 100% juice.  It is, but it is juice from concentrate.  I prefer juice squeezed from the fruit or vegetable itself.  In the case of The Switch the concentrate is filtered sparkling water.  I'm fine drinking concentrates and I drink soda too so I'm not being a health fanatic, but be aware if you are expecting actual juice, this product is filtered water used to reconstitute the juice concentrate.  The juices uses are apple, grape, acerola and cherry.  If you aren't familiar with acerola, it is a cherry like fruit, but with three lobes.  Acerola is high in Vitamin C.NUTRITION:One 8.3 ounce can of The Switch Black Cherry contains:* 130 calories* 15 mg sodium*35 g carbs (33 g sugar)So keep in mind while it has no added sugar it still has the sugar content from its ingredients.  It has more calories than a can of Coke Classic!  It does not have any corn syrup or added sugars though.It also contains 100% of the recommended level of Vitamin C.PRICE:The product costs more than soda, but the ingredients are better.  It costs a little less than Knudsen's Black Cherry Spritzer product.  I use this comparison because the Knudsen product is similar in taste and basic content (filtered sparkling water, fruit concentrate), but a little different in ingredients (no acerola, using pear, pineapple and plum instead), with The Switch having a slight bit more carbs and sugars.Overall, this is a tasty drink.  It is somewhere between a soda and a health drink, definitely better for you than a soda, but not quite as ""natural"" as say all natural juices.

Well, let's give Gold Kili's Instant Ginger Lemon Drink to see if it's worth a rank among the staples of hot beverages.This caffeine-free lemon drink comes individually packaged in foil packages, though the name (""Instant Ginger Lemon Drink"") is a bit too generic in my opinion.  Still, it's up front about what you're getting.The instructions are simple: Pour contents, add hot water (250 ml), stir, and serve instantly.  Upon first opening the packet, the smell of the mix isn't overly appetizing.  The oddly coloured crumbly mix isn't very appealing either.  Also, after the pour, I realized that the 250 ml it calls for isn't even a full cup.  Maybe that's a good thing (it is).The timing to try this out couldn't have been better.  My sore throat looking for a bit of relief.  Unfortunately, this drink just made things worse.  It was just, for lack of a better word. . . nasty!  The first moment it hit my tongue, I felt my lips pucker and my throat constrict.  Lemon & ginger are both powerful flavours, but they can be used well together.  This is not an example of that.  Instead, it has an overpowering taste of that fake lemon flavouring you'll find in low-quality desserts and drinks.  I even tried adding a bit more hot water to dilute the flavours a bit, but to no avail.Overall, just avoid this toxic concoction.  It's not at all worth it.

It's also completely vegan. Just about anyone should be able to eat each of the included components of the meal.The main dish isSunButter Creamy Sunflower Seed SpreadwithCrunchmaster Multi-Grain Crackers.The sunbutter is pretty interesting- you have to sort of knead it before opening the package to make sure it's nice and mixed and pliable. It tastes a lot like peanut butter and is similarly sticky. The texture is more on the smooth side than the crunchy side. The crackers are pretty good- they're crisp and have a mild, subtle flavor.The side dishes are a seed-and-fruit trail mix and a fruit snack.The trail mix is really good- it'sMountain Mambo Nut Free Trail Mix, Gluten, Dairy & Nut Free, the main ingredients of which are pre-shelled sunflower seeds and bits of dried fruit (raisin and apple). My only complaint is that there's only 0.75oz of it, so it goes really quickly. The fruit snack is Niagara Natural Simply Fruit Tropical Bites (no Amazon link, sorry). They're shaped like little pellets or logs and have a flavor and texture that vaguely reminded me ofFruit Roll-Ups. They're mostly made of apple-based ingredients, but a few other fruit juices are also included.The dessert is aEnjoy Life Double chocolate Crunchy Cookie). The cookie is definitely crunchy! I was surprised when I bit into it, though not really in a bad way.

If only the pasta was as easy to prepare...Since I normally make my own pasta sauces, I am often disappointed with prepared sauces, as they seldom meet my taste expectations.  This sauce was better than average in this area, with a great balance of tomato and basil flavors that was really quite pleasing.However, there are a number of things that detracted from my overall impression.  For all the convenience of the pouch, it strikes me as an environmentally unfriendly packaging choice.  After all, cans and jars are easily recyclable, while the pouch isn't.  And really, how inconvenient is it to heat up sauce from a jar?  Again, cooking the pasta takes longer...My other major problem is the size of the package.  This may also be a limitation of the pouch-type packaging, but the label indicates that one pouch provides three servings.  Not exactly sized for a typical family, which I expect would be the people most likely to appreciate the easy to prepare convenience.  When I tossed the contents of the pouch into the pasta I had prepared for my family, it was stretched a bit thin, so to feed four or more people, you're really going to need at least two pouches.

(The cookies, not the testers!  :-) )  They are about two inches across, maybe an eight of an inch thick, and are a darker brown than shown on the package.  Inside the cookie is a thin layer of fudge. The cookies have a bit of a dampish-texture and were all stuck together.The taste of the ""outside"" part of the cookie was slighly similar to soft-baked chocolate chip cookies.  However, the texture was a bit ""grainy"", somewhat like an soft oatmeal cookie.  The fudge layer on the inside was tasty, but was a little overpowered by the rest of the cookie.  It wasn't quite as firm as the layer you'd find in an oreo cookie, and was more like a spread.I love chocolate chip cookies, and I love fudge, so I had high hopes for these.  My wife has similar tastes and also thought they'd be a good cookie to try.  However, the testers and I unanimously agree that they are somewhat mediocre in taste and appearance.  While they aren't terrible by any means, they didn't grab me enough to make me want to go out and get more.  Everyone's taste is different, though, so you may love them.  I give these cookies a three star rating ... that is to say they're not good, they're not bad, they're only fair.As an aside, I received these cookies to evaluate as part of the Amazon Vine program.  The Amazon shipping container was very well protected and undamaged, but when I opened the pack of cookies, about a third of them had been reduced to crumbs, and only two thirds of them were in a condition to eat.  (And those were all stuck together.)  I don't know if that was due to rough handling or excessive heat during shipment, so I didn't consider it as part of my rating.

To my mind, the pasta is usually just a vehicle for whatever topping we're going to put on it! That said, however, Barilla has become our most common choice over the last few years. Why? A couple of reasons, really. Price-wise, this is usually one of the more economical choices. The pasta is reliable and tasty, the variety is impressive, there is a whole grain option, and there is even a new PLUS line for those looking to increase their protein intake.Recently, I received a whole slew of Barilla to try out. Some of these are regulars on my table (like the Whole Grain) and some were first time uses. Again, though, Barilla is a brand I swear by and use almost every week. I just find it hard to gush about food products.Whole Grain Spaghetti (4 1/2 stars): We frequently opt for the whole grain option, I suppose it seems like the healthier alternative. As we've gotten older, we've consciously tried to up our fiber intake and this does so in a pleasant way. Made with 51% whole wheat, we also think these are tastier than traditional pasta. Typical spaghetti preparation.Whole Grain Thin Spaghetti (5 stars): A thinner choice, this gives you the benefits of the whole grains and fiber but mixes better with sauces.Whole Grain Linguine: (5 Stars): One of out preferred choices.  Obviously, we are crazy for the Whole grain option, but like the flat linguine as the option that works best for think and rich sauces.Mezze Penne (4 stars): We eat a surprising amount of Penne and this Mezze is slightly thinner in cylindrical format. Cooks up and maintains its shape well. We often do baked dishes where we cook the pasta first, then bake it. Even double prepared, they hold their shape well and taste good. Better integrity under these circumstances than the wider penne.Linguine Fini (4 1/2 stars): These delineations amuse me. It had never occurred to me that I needed an even thinner Linguine, so (of all of these choices) this was probably the one I wouldn't have tried on my own. But we tend to like this (angel hair is one of our top choices), so this was tasty enough.Oven Ready Lasagna (4 stars): I don't do lasagna very often and never from scratch! If you are a short-cut cook like me, you want things to make your life easier. These noodles don't require any pre-boiling and cook while the dish is baking. It's a brilliant idea that works well for the most part. Due to inconsistencies in layering, you might have sections that crisp up more than others. But a little unevenness is a willing trade for the pain of making traditional lasagna.Ditalini Soup Cuts (4 stars): This is one of the products that I probably wouldn't have picked up of my own accord. I'm simply not a soup maker. But these little pasta cylinders were actually very nice, and super easy to use. We added them to a crock pot preparation. I was afraid they might dissolve completely, but they held up well and added a nice dimesion.Penne Plus (4 stars): This is like the premium choice in Barilla, and so it is more expensive. It's not my first choice. But it would appeal to those that are looking to add protein to their diet, like vegetarians. It has protein and Omega 3's, and is made with healthy ingredients like flax seed and legumes. It takes a little longer to cook, but still tastes fine. KGHarris, 3/12.

No issues with inserting the cups or removing them after puncturing. Water flows very well through them (perhaps too well), and there's no dripping when removing them from the coffee maker.Packaging: there is a punch hole in the side of the box allowing for easy access to the pods. However, since there are 40 cups among several varieties, if you want to get exactly the flavour you want, you'll have to go searching or repackage them in separate containers. I went ahead and left them all in one box after confirming that the box does indeed contain all advertised samples. One note is that it's super easy to tear out the sides of the box when you're opening the access panel - so be advised.The main selling point for this product is the variety of coffee flavours. If you're a coffee purist (and want coffee not added flavours, then this is not the product for you - you'll want to stick to a nice bold roast (or whatever floats your boat). But for those who like a bit of variety in their cup, here's what you get in the box and their general profiles:Boardwalk (medium roast - your basic blend),Breakfast (light roast - see below for decaf version - think dark water - weak taste),Breakfast Decaf (light roast - and they do mean light - think dark water - weak taste),Brooklyn Bridge (medium roast),Cinnamon Subway (there's your cinnamon),Colombian (probably your more expected coffee here),Coney Island Caramel (self-descriptive),Corner Donut Shop (medium extra-bold - think Dunkin Donuts coffee that sat on the burner a bit longer),Cyclone (this one is a dark roast described as bold - and I'd agree),Expres-O (stronger and bolder - similar to cyclone),French Roast (not as strong as I expect for a French roast but good),Fuhgeddaboutit (another dark roast described as extra-bold - brew this one using your strong Keurig setting),Hazelnut (a light roast flavoured - smells good - very weak taste - another dark water one),Maple Sleigh (if you want coffee to taste like pancakes),Oh Fudge (the smell of chocolate but the taste is weak - another dark water one),Vanilla Skyline (just what you'd think - a hint of vanilla).Overall there's plenty of variety for you to choose from - especially if you don't want to buy 10 different flavoured creamers, you can mix and match these to create the combo you want. For example I mixed the French Roast and the Oh Fudge for a stronger chocolate-theme. I have also blended the Hazelnut and Vanilla Skyline (although both of these are generally weak coffee so it was more about the flavours than strength).And that's where I started to see a theme emerging - the majority of these coffees just aren't strong enough for me. Even the French Roast and Columbian seemed weaker than their other-branded counterparts. Express-O was more bold as was Cyclone, but not different enough for me to really care.Finally - sustainability factor. You've got a foil top and a large plastic K-cup in this product. As compared to some brands coming out of San Fran which have mesh-style cups, this one has more plastic and is a larger sized product (without the commensurate denser packed coffee). I prefer to minimize waste, and this product has a bit more than others. I'd like to see something smaller and with more coffee packed inside. The best way to explain this last part is that the water flows through the K-Cup too fast and gets clear too quickly. Other brands I've seen the water almost struggle to get through and stay dark and rich the entire brew.Overall this product gets higher marks for VARIETY OF FLAVOURS and COMPATIBILITY with different K-Cup products. Where I take away two stars there are issues with consistent product STRENGTH and SUSTAINABILITY. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3842, 3856)",1,0.0,False

Almost nothing beats a cup of hot chocolate and a graham cracker or two on a cold winter evening in my book.That said, I recently had the opportunity to try out Back to Nature 100% Natural Golden Honey Oat Graham Crackers. My verdict? They're a delicious and healthier way of eating graham crackers.The size of the product is similar to Nabisco's Honey Grahams. Each cracker is perforated into four evenly sized pieces. The texture is much rougher and heartier than what you would find in Honey Grahams with oat pieces that are discernible in the crackers. Because of the texture and heartier composition these grahams are a bit more brittle than Nabisco's product. Though my box arrived with mostly intact crackers.I found the taste of the Back to Nature grahams to be comparable to Honey Grahams but not nearly as sweet or intense. Personally, I'm willing to compromise some of the taste for a healthier snack and these crackers fit the bill perfectly. Back to Nature proudly labels the front of the box with ""no artificial preservatives, flavors or colors and no high fructose corn syrup"". Sounds good to me!Each box contains 3 individually wrapped packages containing seven graham crackers.

The unit always dispensed too slow, but it made good coffee.  But I would let it drip for half a minute after brewing and there was still water in the base.  So, instead of pressing it down slightly, like I recommended below, shake it!!  It appears to aerate and distribute the coffee and makes a better cup.  Please give it a try and leave comments to let me know if it worked for you with your coffee maker.------------------------------------------------I like this product primarily because it is stainless steel.  It is sturdier.  Stainless steel does not interact with the coffee (although the plastic part that disperses the water may.)  The steel also cleans way easier than the other filters.  The Solo Fill works great, but the coffee sticks to it making it a pain to clean.  The Keurig one is a pain because it has too many parts and each has to be cleaned.  This one is a fast rinse clean which saves time.I will tell you a quick solution I found to improve the coffee this makes.  I know it says not to do it.  But when I do, I get better results.  Tamp down the coffee slightly with your fingers.  Don't crush it or press it down with a spoon, just lightly compact it so it is clear of the diffuser part of the top.  The coffee disperses better and the water passes through a bit better.  The coffee is as good as from most of the K-Cups with fresh ground.  I think the Solo Fill is slightly better, but I have not done a blind taste test and both are good.  The Ekobrew does not leave as much sediment in the coffee, but some still passes though depending on the grind.So why can't I give it five stars?  There are problems, each deducting some portion of the star.1. The coffee brews, but it brews painfully slow.  Takes twice as long for the water to pass through.  Of course, that likely is a method to get more out of the coffee, but it does get annoying.  I think this is because the side holes to dispense the coffee don't work particularl well and most of it has to drip out the bottom.2. The thing holds onto water.  Because it dispenses so slowly, the coffee maker has given up applying water pressure before it is done.  So, there is water both on top and inside the cup.  Dirty coffee water.  And it tends to drip when picked up if you do it too soon after brewing.I have another brand coming soon, and maybe it will be even better...or not.  I like the Solo fill best, but it is hard to clean and all plastic which concerns me from both a durability and transference of chemicals into the coffee perspective.  The latter is likely just paranoia.  Everything is plastic these days.The trick for me is to have several of these so I can just pop them in the dishwasher always having a clean one when I need it rather than having to continually rinse the stupid thing.  That makes them nearly as convenient as the K cups themselves. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2895, 2909)",1,0.0,False

My only complaint is that there's only 0.75oz of it, so it goes really quickly. The fruit snack is Niagara Natural Simply Fruit Tropical Bites (no Amazon link, sorry).

This sugar has a low glycemic index and is also a nutrient powerhouse, filled with lots of vitamins, minerals and amino acids. Coconut sugar is minimally processed, unbleached and contains no preservatives.Coconut sugar is made from the sugar blossoms of fresh coconuts found in the tropics. It is harvested by slicing the bud of the coconut tree flower to release the sap or coconut nectar. This nectar is then boiled into a thick caramel and dried into crystals. Nothing is removed during this process. Coconut sugar is similar in texture and taste to brown sugar but far outweighs its nutritional profile.In terms of nutrients, coconut sugar contains the minerals calcium, magnesium, potassium, zinc, iron, copper, manganese, phosphorus and boron. It also contains 12 of the B vitamins, including thiamine, riboflavin, pyridoxine, nicotinic acid, biotin, pyridoxal and inositol. Coconut sugar contains 16 out of the 20 amino acids. This sugar is especially high in the amino acids glutamic acid, which makes glutamine, threonine, aspartic acid and serine.We use it in place of brown sugar for baking purposes. It tastes a lot like brown sugar but it is a lot drier. So, when you open the bag and check it out, it doesn't clump together, but is loose like the texture of white sugar.

There is no flavor meaning, no lemon or apple or ginger flavor. Taste?  sure there is a metallic taste that I am not fond of.Most of us know that caffeine has a bitter taste ergo the metallic taste in this water. How do you get rid of the bitter taste? and if  you can why don't they do it for coffee and tea?To say this water is delicious is a bit of a stretch for me,  if, as they say it has no flavor and no taste,  how can it be delicious? To be delicious there must be a taste or flavor,Now my second part: what is the point?  This  just my opinion, that is what I was given this product for. I don't get the point.It has no flavor, no taste.  It has some bitter caffeine, why do you need caffeine to give you a lift?.  And if you need a lift why use bitter caffeine?I gave it 3 stars because it was wet cold and did not taste terrible, it just didn't taste.You could drink filtered water and have a nice fruit to give you a lift and get some vitamins from it.I just finished the bottle and find there is a slight lift but in a way that I do not find comfortable.  If you like caffeine and water then this may be your thing. Drink it to get a lift.But for me I will drink my filtered water and have a nice slice of ice cold watermelon to give me my lift for the day and I bet I will enjoy it a lot more than drinking this.Now I must say that as I am writing this my heart is reacting to the caffeine, so be careful if you are sensitive.

Any seed that I consume needs to be fresh since going rancid means worthless.GENERAL: No, these will not make you high mentally but yet I get high physically since three tablespoon of this beauty, once again only 3 tablespoon which is 30 gr, offer me 50% magnesium and 25% zinc which allows me to get to really high spots in the mountains with my mountain bike or catch those big high waves in the ocean since my muscles do not cramp due to magnesium intake of hemp seeds. What an absolute joke, in US they continuously talk about health care but yet this one creation of nature which offers so much not only is not produced in US but yet the only site that I trust for ingredients which is the USDA Nutritional Value, will not offer me any info in regard to this superfood. Now you probably get an idea why so many industries controlling your dear representatives in US Senate will not allow hemp to have a chance to flourish in US. Big Pharma loves that idea since they sell those magnesium supplements which god knows what is in those unregulated tablets but yet citizens of US will not have access to the simple knowledge of all the minerals, vitamins, proteins and multitude of healthy hidden ingredients that this superfood offers at a reasonable price but yet they have all the nutritional value of Chia seeds which hardly has any vitamin or mineral but yet a whopping fiber at a whopping price since it is no threat to any industry in US... shame, shame, shame. While hemp and marijuana are kissing cousins, the amount of THC in hemp is almost non existent. Two tablespoons contains 400 milligrams of anti-inflammatory gamma-linolenic acid and 2 grams of omega-3 fats, plus all nine essential amino acids, compounds that help maximize recovery from workouts. I consume these straight from the container with spoon, an hour before my work outs without mixing in a bowl or as dressing. I consume it first thing in the morning or when I need a quick burst of energy regardless of the time of the day. For years I have consumed 1)raw sunflower seeds, 2)almonds in water 3)organic sesame+flax seeds ground in coffee maker+cocoa powder+unflavoured protein isolate, 4)hemp seeds, 5)watermelon & garlic on daily basis. Seeds all go rancid due to the oil and the germ of the seed so regardless of the type or brand, seeds need to be stored in freezer, in a dark, cold, sealed container, away from any moisture. If plastic container then it needs to be #5 or for me it is much safer in glass containers that keeps air out. I consume seeds within two weeks and insure not to purchase in big quantities since freshness is a priority to me due to the nutritional value which I consume food for, any food. Hemp is an unbelievable product and you can not grow it in US since it is illegal and big business does not want to see you healthy. No gain for big industries either since it is so cheap to grow with so many benefits that scares big pharma, plastic industry, fabric-cotton industry, pesticide producers, etc... so if you live in US, Canada becomes your only hope. Hemp increases my level of energy without any artificial stimulants like caffeine and sugar. More energy with less empty calorie fillers like sugar and saturated fat, in all energy bars which I never consume. Hemp contains the highest percentage of globulin than any other plant which is an essential amino acid that helps my body to create antibodies, a component of a healthy immune system. Healthy addition to a weight loss plan since it provides essential nutrients such as protein, essential fatty acids, fibre, vitamins and minerals without adding an excess amount of calories, starch, sugar or salt. One of the best natural boosters that I can get when doing any type of sport or when I need energy without a big meal. Hemp is truly a good plant for the environment and it is shame that we have to deal with the politics of the hemp instead of the benefits of the hemp in US. Victim of its own success. This is a super food next to quinoa, kale, broccoli, dandelion, raw honey, garlic, legumes, nuts, seeds, etc...MINERALS: Hemp is one of the kings of nutrients when it comes to minerals and so important to me as a whole delicious seed with highest magnesium, highest potassium, highest zinc and the healthiest fat......................SESAME...FLAX....CHIA....AMARANTH....QUINOA..HEMPCALORIES.......565.........534......490......371.............368.........567SAT FAT..........34...........18........16........7................4............17CALCIUM.........99...........26........63........16..............5.............0MAGNESIUM....89...........98.........0.........62..............49.............167POTASSIUM.....14...........23..........5..........15..............16.............167ZINC...............48...........29........23........19..............21..............83FRESHNESS: Fresh means nutritious and delicious. I consume lots of seeds, beans, grains, vegetables, etc. and freshness is a priority regardless of the brand so I always purchase my food ingredients in small quantities from reputable sellers with high turnover. When fresh, food is nutritious and that goes for any food in any form, from frozen to canned. Fresh food is nutritious as well as delicious since nutrients give food its delicious taste. When old or rancid, nutrients are gone and any food item becomes an empty calories with no taste and absolutely worthless regardless of the brand or price, organic or conventional. For few years I consumed seeds in oil form since physicians advised me to do so not knowing that majority are not aware that seeds hardly offer any nutrients unless; seeds are fresh, not old which means rancid, not in oil form, not in supplement form, not hulled, ground and consumed within few days, kept in dark cold temperatures, away from light-sun-moisture since the oil in seeds and nuts go rancid regardless. That is why brown rice which has its nutrients will go rancid even if kept in freezer while white rice will last for years at room temperature since it hardly has any nutrients or oil. I ground in my coffee grinder sesame, flax, chia, amaranth, hemp then add cocoa, isolate protein, soy milk and consume it before my workouts on daily basis for its vitamins, minerals, protein and many nutrients, without much spike in my glucose. Un-hulled seeds are full of nutrients. I never consume hulled seeds which are empty calories, absolutely worthless since the nutrients have been removed.FAT: The most important hormone, and the one that's crucial for weight loss, is insulin. Insulin is the hormone that controls fat storage. A high-carb diet increases the amount of glucose in the bloodstream, which in turn means you produce more insulin. The more insulin the body produces, the more fat gets stored. A low-carb diet means less insulin, making it easier to lose weight because less fat is then stored. For intake of a massive 5,000 calories every day for three weeks with calories from a low-fat, high-carb diet; and for another three weeks with calories from more fat no carbs with exactly the same amount of calories, with moderate exercise regimen each time; low-fat diet stacked on 16&#8201;lb with 3.7"" (9.5&#8201;cm) around the middle where the high fat diet offered a loss of 2.5 lb and loss of 1""(2.5&#8201;cm) from waistline. If calorie is calorie, then in my case and my experience shows that I would prefer to get my calories from a healthy fat from sesame seed and almond than the calories from the carbs in chia. Almonds have the highest fat calories from all the seeds and nuts and that is a priority to me in type of calories since I am kind of vegan who consumes fish but hardly any meat or chicken.For 28gr/1oz servings size for peanut/almonds/chia/sesame/sunflower/cashew/flax accordingly;167/137/160/162/155/150 total calories27.3/21.9/50/26.8/31.2/34.4/33.0 from carbs116/124/72.1/116/112/103/98.8 from fat21.3/21.5/15.2/17.2/19.1/17.7/17.8 is from proteinFor almost the same total calories sesame offers half of chia's ""CARB CALORIES"" gain but 50% more ""FAT CALORIES"" with high amount of nutrients for weight loss. Sesame is my calcium but almonds are the superfood when it comes to fat calories and vitamin E. Americans consume enough peanut butter each year to coat the floor of the Grand Canyon, priced for 1/3 but hardly with any nutrients vs. sesame. None offer ALA and not only flax's high ALA is needed but it balances the omega-6 which is so abandoned in all foods and not healthy at all. But, but, but, Hemp is the king for magnesium, potassium, zinc where is needed most for my muscle cramps and goes with all my work outs.Organic is always better for the planet earth and its inhabitants if organic available. The most harmful and deadly diseases plaguing America today are caused by food; cheap, low quality processed foods high in sugar, fat, salt, genetically modified ingredients and pesticides. when you reach for whole, nutrient-dense, organic foods, you get a food-remedy tool kit that not only will ward off cancer and heart disease, but also colds, flu, allergies, and a host of other ailments that plague us every day.

The unit always dispensed too slow, but it made good coffee.  But I would let it drip for half a minute after brewing and there was still water in the base.  So, instead of pressing it down slightly, like I recommended below, shake it!!  It appears to aerate and distribute the coffee and makes a better cup.  Please give it a try and leave comments to let me know if it worked for you with your coffee maker.------------------------------------------------I like this product primarily because it is stainless steel.  It is sturdier.  Stainless steel does not interact with the coffee (although the plastic part that disperses the water may.)  The steel also cleans way easier than the other filters.  The Solo Fill works great, but the coffee sticks to it making it a pain to clean.  The Keurig one is a pain because it has too many parts and each has to be cleaned.  This one is a fast rinse clean which saves time.I will tell you a quick solution I found to improve the coffee this makes.  I know it says not to do it.  But when I do, I get better results.  Tamp down the coffee slightly with your fingers.  Don't crush it or press it down with a spoon, just lightly compact it so it is clear of the diffuser part of the top.  The coffee disperses better and the water passes through a bit better.  The coffee is as good as from most of the K-Cups with fresh ground.  I think the Solo Fill is slightly better, but I have not done a blind taste test and both are good.  The Ekobrew does not leave as much sediment in the coffee, but some still passes though depending on the grind.So why can't I give it five stars?  There are problems, each deducting some portion of the star.1. The coffee brews, but it brews painfully slow.  Takes twice as long for the water to pass through.  Of course, that likely is a method to get more out of the coffee, but it does get annoying.  I think this is because the side holes to dispense the coffee don't work particularl well and most of it has to drip out the bottom.2. The thing holds onto water.  Because it dispenses so slowly, the coffee maker has given up applying water pressure before it is done.  So, there is water both on top and inside the cup.  Dirty coffee water.  And it tends to drip when picked up if you do it too soon after brewing.I have another brand coming soon, and maybe it will be even better...or not.  I like the Solo fill best, but it is hard to clean and all plastic which concerns me from both a durability and transference of chemicals into the coffee perspective.  The latter is likely just paranoia.  Everything is plastic these days.The trick for me is to have several of these so I can just pop them in the dishwasher always having a clean one when I need it rather than having to continually rinse the stupid thing.  That makes them nearly as convenient as the K cups themselves. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2895, 2909)",1,0.0,False

I do not buy rainbow quinoas since they sell for a high price without having enough red or black but more of white but C & F sells one of the best white and red mix since C & F offers more red than white in the mix. I usually buy the white, red and black separately and mix as I wish as well since quinoa is just an important part of my diet.KEEN-Waah... A complete protein source, a seed related to other healthy cousins like spinach and beets. In a pot I place quinoa, frozen peas, carrots, corn, add water and tomato paste. Spinach is added at the end the last minute. Stewing tomatoes for a half hour increases the cancer fighting lycopene content by 35 percent. Cooking also unlocks another nutrient, beta-carotene, in corn and carrots since heat breaks down the fibrous cell walls, releasing more of these antioxidants. The same goes for spinach but then you need to get your vitamin C from something else since that is the first vitamin which is depleted with heat. I saute lots of onion separately then in ten minutes I add paprika, cumin, dillweed, gram marsala, crushed red pepper, turmeric and lots of garlic2 x 2 Pound Fresh Garlic USA California Heirloom Monviso Gilroy Finest (4 Pounds Total), mix it well and add the mix to the pot and let it sit without heat for five minutes. This is what vegans consume instead of beef since it is a complete protein. Greens, vegetables, nuts, seeds, etc. may have protein but the fact is that only quinoa has a complete protein and all others do not since all others are missing few amino acids here and there but not quinoa. I rarely ever consume beef, chicken, etc. so fish and quinoa are the only source of complete protein with all amino acids for me. Organic, whole grain, very fulfilling due to some starch with host of vitamins, minerals that no beef or chicken can even come close to. Cooks in ten minutes with some water, no fat, no salt, no sugar... I consume it with eggplant, onions, okra, smoked hearings, curry type dishes with lots of spices and delicious juices. I never ever have to wash and rinse before cooking either. I keep the uncooked portions in double zip lock bags in freezer. I consume so much that I never have to worry about the unused portion going rancid and unlike brown rice which loses its oil in less than six months and becomes worthless even if kept in freezer, quinoa will last longer. Obviously I never ever do that with any food since I only purchase what I need in order to get the nutrients which are a healthy portion of my diet. Gluten free, the best product for me when I go camping since all I do is add lemon and tomato and that way I never have to worry about paying arm and leg for that lousy, awful tasting dry foods. I ground chia+flax+sesame, mix it with cocoa+isolate+soy milk before my workouts every single day or no workout regardless. Three tbsp of quinoa in my power drink offers me 4gr of pure, complete protein with all amino acids. I add organic paprika to regular yellow quinoa and it turns the dish into a beautiful red color. Healthy, healthier and healthiest of many seeds, delicious sprouts only in 3 days with all amino acids. I am an athlete with a healthy diet. I used to consume brown rice heavily years ago but no longer. I can consume quinoa with tomato and lemon juice and it is the best food I can take with me anywhere on any sports trip and I do not even have to wash it either. Delicious, delicious, delicious.FRESHNESS: Fresh means nutritious and delicious. I consume lots of seeds, beans, grains, vegetables, etc. and freshness is a priority regardless of the brand so I always purchase my food ingredients in small quantities from reputable sellers with high turnover. When fresh, food is nutritious and that goes for any food in any form, from frozen to canned. Fresh food is nutritious as well as delicious since nutrients give food its delicious taste. When old or rancid, nutrients are gone and any food item becomes an empty calories with no taste and absolutely worthless regardless of the brand or price, organic or conventional. For few years I consumed seeds in oil form since physicians advised me to do so not knowing that majority are not aware that seeds hardly offer any nutrients unless; seeds are fresh, not old which means rancid, not in oil form, not in supplement form, not hulled, ground and consumed within few days, kept in dark cold temperatures, away from light-sun-moisture since the oil in seeds and nuts go rancid regardless. That is why brown rice which has its nutrients will go rancid even if kept in freezer while white rice will last for years at room temperature since it hardly has any nutrients or oil. I ground in my coffee grinder sesame, flax, chia, amaranth, hemp then add cocoa, isolate protein, soy milk and consume it before my workouts on daily basis for its vitamins, minerals, protein and many nutrients, without much spike in my glucose. Un-hulled seeds are full of nutrients. I never consume hulled seeds which are empty calories, absolutely worthless since the nutrients have been removed.STARCH: Some carbohydrates, such as sugars and most starch are rapidly digested and absorbed as glucose into the body through the small intestine and subsequently used for short-term energy needs or stored. Resistant starch on the other hand, resists digestion and passes through to the large intestine where it acts like dietary fiber. Sugar, honey, maple syrup, white flour, white rice, whole-grain pastry flour, packaged cold cereals, commercial fruit juices, and fruit-juice sweetened beverages are the same foods some dentists claim rots the teeth from the inside out by changing the balance and ratio of calcium to phosphorous in the bloodstream. Your immune system goes down when you wolf down sweets, especially around events and holiday meals. High Glycemic foods quickly turn to sugar in your blood stream, causing excess insulin to pour into your blood to get rid of the excess sugar. The excess insulin pushes the calcium and fat into your arteries, especially if you have only a few cholesterol receptors on your liver (which is genetic). Whole wheat and white bread have essentially the same impact on blood sugar so I try to consume bread with whole sprouted grains, even flourless breads, and no-yeast breads. Black beans, northern beans, navy beans, red kidney beans, lentils, split peas, black-eyed peas, brown rice, rolled oats, millet, corn, black rice are all Resistance Starch. King of starch for me is quinoa and Navy Beans before and post expedition trips, 17.6gr vs. 15.4gr for 100gr serving. No wonder the price of quinoa is going up, up, up...

I received my free sample in the mail on a hot, hot, day and so I don't know if that may have somehow altered the taste but I did wait to taste it only after it had been chilled in the fridge for several hours.My initial reaction to the taste was neither good or bad, just that it wasn't at all what I had expected an all natural apple flavored drink to taste like.  It tastes an awful lot like sour apple blow pops (the candy), in liquid form.  Not necessarily a bad taste for candy but as a beverage, not so good.  As I continued to sip away at this drink, it became obvious that I wasn't going to be able to finish the can (I was about half ways through...).  There was an unpleasant taste to this drink that I can't quite put my finger on, but I noticed that it intensified each time I returned to take another sip.  Maybe something you wouldn't notice if you can swig the entire can down in a few gulps...  not sure why each subsequent tasting made it less and less palatable from the sip prior, maybe the Stevia sweetener?  I don't know.As for being an energy drink, one can is supposed to have the same amount of caffeine as a cup of coffee.  I already drink an absurd amount of coffee daily to begin with...  I didn't notice an energy boost from the half can I was able to drink and don't anticipate that I would have had I been able to drink the full can.  This might appeal to individuals who don't consume caffeine on a daily basis to begin with and would find other energy drinks to be a bit too stimulating.

No issues with inserting the cups or removing them after puncturing. Water flows very well through them (perhaps too well), and there's no dripping when removing them from the coffee maker.Packaging: there is a punch hole in the side of the box allowing for easy access to the pods. However, since there are 40 cups among several varieties, if you want to get exactly the flavour you want, you'll have to go searching or repackage them in separate containers. I went ahead and left them all in one box after confirming that the box does indeed contain all advertised samples. One note is that it's super easy to tear out the sides of the box when you're opening the access panel - so be advised.The main selling point for this product is the variety of coffee flavours. If you're a coffee purist (and want coffee not added flavours, then this is not the product for you - you'll want to stick to a nice bold roast (or whatever floats your boat). But for those who like a bit of variety in their cup, here's what you get in the box and their general profiles:Boardwalk (medium roast - your basic blend),Breakfast (light roast - see below for decaf version - think dark water - weak taste),Breakfast Decaf (light roast - and they do mean light - think dark water - weak taste),Brooklyn Bridge (medium roast),Cinnamon Subway (there's your cinnamon),Colombian (probably your more expected coffee here),Coney Island Caramel (self-descriptive),Corner Donut Shop (medium extra-bold - think Dunkin Donuts coffee that sat on the burner a bit longer),Cyclone (this one is a dark roast described as bold - and I'd agree),Expres-O (stronger and bolder - similar to cyclone),French Roast (not as strong as I expect for a French roast but good),Fuhgeddaboutit (another dark roast described as extra-bold - brew this one using your strong Keurig setting),Hazelnut (a light roast flavoured - smells good - very weak taste - another dark water one),Maple Sleigh (if you want coffee to taste like pancakes),Oh Fudge (the smell of chocolate but the taste is weak - another dark water one),Vanilla Skyline (just what you'd think - a hint of vanilla).Overall there's plenty of variety for you to choose from - especially if you don't want to buy 10 different flavoured creamers, you can mix and match these to create the combo you want. For example I mixed the French Roast and the Oh Fudge for a stronger chocolate-theme. I have also blended the Hazelnut and Vanilla Skyline (although both of these are generally weak coffee so it was more about the flavours than strength).And that's where I started to see a theme emerging - the majority of these coffees just aren't strong enough for me. Even the French Roast and Columbian seemed weaker than their other-branded counterparts. Express-O was more bold as was Cyclone, but not different enough for me to really care.Finally - sustainability factor. You've got a foil top and a large plastic K-cup in this product. As compared to some brands coming out of San Fran which have mesh-style cups, this one has more plastic and is a larger sized product (without the commensurate denser packed coffee). I prefer to minimize waste, and this product has a bit more than others. I'd like to see something smaller and with more coffee packed inside. The best way to explain this last part is that the water flows through the K-Cup too fast and gets clear too quickly. Other brands I've seen the water almost struggle to get through and stay dark and rich the entire brew.Overall this product gets higher marks for VARIETY OF FLAVOURS and COMPATIBILITY with different K-Cup products. Where I take away two stars there are issues with consistent product STRENGTH and SUSTAINABILITY. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3842, 3856)",4,0.0,False
