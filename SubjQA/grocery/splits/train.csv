Although I was a little suspicious of salmon in a plastic container, it is tasty.  The salmon has a little kick to it that keeps it from tasting like tuna fish.  The dried fruit and nut mix are surprisingly good.  The edamame?  It's alllll riiiiight if you like that sort of thing.  Put enough salt on it and I'll eat it.  A small piece of chocolate brings this lunch to a sweet and dark end.I'm planning to get a six pack of these to keep in the car.

They are thin and relatively crispy without being dusty/messy crispy.  I definitely taste the fig but not so much any honey, nothing wrong with that.  Over all the flavor is nice and there is enough flavor, some plain cookies of this type are just like sugary cardboard, but these have flavor.  I think I prefer the flavor of the cranberry ones to these because the flavor of these is not as strong and is warmer flavor than the citrusy cranberry ones.  Now, what surprised me the most, how not-that-bad-for-you these are.  There are no preservatives which is nice.

Now, while I said I preferred the cranberry flavor that preference is not enough to make but the cranberry ones over these and the reason is that the fig ones have one more gram of fiber and one less gram of carbs per serving, that little extra is enough that I'd choose the fig over the cranberry and why these got 5 stars instead of 4 like I gave the cranberry ones.

Overall, this is a slightly better product, with better color and a better taste making the small difference.As with the jalapeno sauce, this product appears to be trying to cover too many bases.  It's ""sauce,"" which means it could go into anything, in cooking or in serving, so it seems to be landing as both a cooking ingredient and as a table condiment.  And it could go on anything from your breakfast eggs to your mac `n cheez for dinner, which makes it a table condiment for breakfast, lunch, dinner, any time.  And its ""bold,"" the American euphemism for something that's not really spicy, is marginally beyond the typical bland and boring that most Americans rely upon.  It's got the tiniest tinge of spice, but isn't powerful in the least; the taste of this product does not qualify as ""bold.""  Now, the taste ofCheez-It Hot & Spicy; they got ""bold"" with that one.The bottle's copy says the same as the jalapeno sauce, that it's perfect with ""tacos, Mexican salads and sandwich wraps.""  In our house it went on pork roast, couscous, green beans, Brussels sprouts, meatloaf, and french fries.  My kids (13 and 15) both liked the sauce and declared it was definitely better than the jalapeno sauce.The basis of this sauce is a mayo/buttermilk dressing-type mixture.  I don't know, but it strikes me that all of the Taco Bell sauces start with the same plain base, and the respective flavors are just dumped in at the factory.  The sauce is not chunky in the slightest, and squeezes right out of the bottle.The pluses in this product are the color and taste.  Where the jalapeno sauce faltered because of an unappetizing color of mayonnaise-off-white with mysterious green flecks, this one's smoky-creamy orange color is far more appealing.  It looks better in the packaging, and it looks much better on the plate and on the food.  The taste also is better. Jalapeno is a very distinctive taste, and those who know it and seek it out want that hard burst of powerful, earthy jalapeno punch, the chipotle taste is one that is more subtle, not nearly as strong, and as such works much better in this sauce.  The taste of this product is slightly smoky, with a good tang--not bold, mind you, and not even close to spicy.The sauce is just a bit too runny, though.  Yeah, it's in a squeeze bottle and it's got to have the right consistency to actually flow out of the packaging, but at the same time, it's a bit too runny when it gets on the plate.  Taco Bell needs to thicken it up just a little bit more to get it to the right consistency.This sauce is not bad; it does not taste bad.  It just doesn't deliver on what I'm looking for when it comes to spicy.  If I were starving on a desert island, I'd slurp this stuff out of the bottle and call it the Food of the Gods.Bottom line: ""Creamy"" this sauce is, but ""bold"" it is not.  Our family knows hot and spicy, and a lame American ""bold"" doesn't cut it for us.  If we want Scoville-graded heat with our food, we'll go for theSriracha,Crystal,Cholula, etc.  If we want creamy, we'll go for the all-American ranch dressing or straight-up mayo, and we'll leave this product on the shelf.

I am generally a fan of crackers with a cheese filling, but the flavor of the cheese filling only moderately enthused me.  I thought the flavor could have been stronger and there could have been more cheese filling.  I could taste the flavor, but it sometimes got lost in the cracker flavor, which is good.  Indeed, the more I chewed a Crackerful, the more flavor I seemed to get from the cracker.This product proclaims on the front that it is an ""excellent source of fiber.""  One individual package has five grams of fiber, which is about 20% of the daily-recommended value of fiber.  However, those five grams of fiber is connected with 7 grams of total fat and 2 grams of saturated fat.  The total calories in the little bar are 130.  In my mind, connecting five grams of fiber to 7 grams of fat would argue against Crackerfuls being an ""excellent"" source of fiber.Another thing that influences my opinion of ""excellent"" is the list of ingredients, which extends for half the side of the box.  There are preservatives and all sorts of artificial ingredients.  What kind of person thinks a lengthy list of artificial ingredients and 7 grams of fat leads to the conclusion of ""excellent""?  Not that I am pitching any particular product, but two Fiber Choice tablets have 4 grams of fiber, 16 calories, and no fat.  The Fiber Choice is significantly cheaper and has eight ingredients.  You tell me which product you would classify as an ""excellent"" source of fiber, or at least a ""good"" source of fiber.  Perhaps excellent would be raw vegetables or fruit.I also think Crackerfuls are relatively expensive considering the available options.  For example, Austin cheese crackers tend to be somewhere around $0.17 to $0.20 per ounce.  Crackerfuls cost about $0.92 per ounce, depending on the quantity you buy.Moving beyond price and the hyperbole of advertising, I think the packaging is good.  Each Crackerful has its own individual package, which means that you can throw them in a lunch box or your pocket and not have to worry about them getting stale or soggy.Bottom line:  I like these crackers.  They have good flavor and texture and their package makes them portable.  While I panned the ""excellent"" nature of the fiber, I consider crackers like these a snack and having fiber is neither make or break for the cracker.  A bigger hurdle is the price, which I think is high as compared to alternatives.  The price suggests this product is more of a luxury than an everyday snack cracker.Good luck!

My wife and I had both read multiple books and articles that stated how healthy Coconut oil is and we are constantly looking for ways to improve our diets. We have since incorporated it into many aspects of our diets. In particular, its amazing with some of the juicing recipes we have come up with. I also enjoy cooking with it, but only with certain meals. Its important to note that cooking oils at high temperatures really cuts down on the nutritional content. So we always cook at lower temperatures when using Coconut or Olive oil. Anyways, we have come to love Coconut oil and it now has a permanent spot in our food pantry.We also started making homemade soap a few years back and while we didn't use coconut oil originally, we figured we would try it since we already had jars of it sitting on our shelves. Well, to make a long story short, its now incorporated in every single one of our recipes. In fact, my favorite soap is actually a recipe that focuses specifically on the coconut oil.Lastly, my wife one upped the soap making and started making homemade shampoo and conditioners and to say that they are amazing is a massive understatement. In particular, the conditioner she makes is unbelievable. I dont know the recipes but I do know that coconut oil is one of the major ingredients that she uses. My hair has never been softer and neither has hers. On top of that the smell is absolutely hypnotic.Bottom line - 12 months ago Coconut oil had absolutely no place in our home. Fast forward to today and....well, it now plays an major role in our lives, both for dietary and hygienic purposes. Even if you dont make homemade soaps, the health benefits alone should be more than enough for you to incorporate Coconut oil into your diet. Its one of the healthiest oils out there.Highly Recommended. ANSWERNOTFOUND",My wife and I had both read multiple books and articles,"(56, 111)",2,0.0,False

In fact, that's how Switch bills itself: A perfect balance between juice and carbonation. That's my rave over this new drink.Now here's my reluctance to embrace the drink with five stars. I poured the 8.3 fluid ounces into a small glass (I have a huge collection of mismatched, but adorable clear glasses of all sizes, including this little bowl wine glass I removed from a college cafeteria in France many years ago). The glass held the contents of this tall, thin can of cheery cherry drink perfectly. But wait, by the time I quaffed the contents, I held the glass askance and asked: Is that all? I want more!In comparison my favorite beverage, Zero Sprite, holds 12 fluid ounces, a perfect amount to quench my thirst after a few hours working in the yard. I add ice to Sprite and don't care if it is watered down, but this Black Cherry Switch? No, one does not want to water down this exotic flavor. It must be drunk straight.As for its can slogan: ""100% of what you want and 0% of what you don't,"" I'm not sure about that. Let's examine it. ""What you want"" is ""100% juice, 100% RDA Vitamin C, All natural, Carbonated, Great taste and refreshment."" I agree with all of those. So far, so good.Let's look at ""what you don't"" want: ""No sugar added, No corn syrup, No preservatives, No artificial colors, and Gluten free."" True on all those.Next the label. This is where it gets confusing. Total fat 0g, Sodium 15mg, Total Carbs 35g, Sugar 33g, Protein 0g, and 130 calories. The 33 grams of sugar can be confusing. If none was added, then the 33g must come with the natural juice. And Switch does bill itself on 100% juice.In comparison my Sprite can contains 38g of sugar and 140 calories. I thought Zero Sprite contained zero sugar. My bad. I didn't read the label. It is free of caffeine, fat, cholesterol, fiber, Vitamin A and Vitamin C, but no mention of sugar, which I assume comes from the corn syrup.I'm no nutritionist, but it seems that drinking Switch is much better than drinking a Zero Sprite, except that the can is larger so you get more.I would change those four stars to five now, except 8.3 Fl OZ still is not quite enough for one drink.Will I switch? No, but I will add Black Cherry Switch to my fridge for an occasional delightfully refreshing drink when I don't need more.

I've been eating them little by little over the last few days. I've eaten half the bag now and I can definitely say that I really don't like them at all. In fact, I have no desire to finish the bag.I definitely would not buy this snack again. Neither would I be tempted to take a bite if I found a bowl of them at a party.The package contains four one-quarter cup servings. Each serving consists of about a dozen round marble-sized dried apple clusters held together by concentrated apple juice mixed with potato starch.These round snack clusters are extremely crunchy, needing the powerful back molars to crush them. When I first did this, my mouth felt like it was full of a very dry crunchy substance that when crushed, gave off a dry powder around my mouth. There was nothing to relieve the dry feeling (no lubricating fat or liquid content). This was an odd sensation, and not a pleasant one. Even crunchy chips and nuts have a high fat content to lubricate them. I can't remember tasting anything before that was so crunchy and dry at the same time.After the extreme crunch, the next thing I noticed was an unusual sweetness on top of a very muted apple and cinnamon flavor. I don't mean a strong candy-like sweetness, but rather a sweetness not generally associated with an apple taste. Obviously, these clusters have been soaked in highly concentrated apple juice and the intense sweetness came from what I perceived as too much natural apple sugar. The final sensation I noticed was a nice tart after-taste that lingered after the snack was swallowed.The snack didn't taste bad, but it certainly didn't taste very good either. Personally, I did not like the crunchy dry texture, nor did I enjoy the unnatural sweetness coming from something with subtle apple flavor. The tart after-taste was mildly pleasurable.As an experiment, I grabbed a real apple and cut it up into bite-sized pieces. I tested the two snacks side by side. For me, the real apple was without any doubt the better snack. What I quickly realized in this comparison experiment was what the apple snack lacked over the real thing. An apple is juicy; the snack was dry. The apple has a very complex mixture of many subtle tastes; the snack was dominated by only two overwhelming tastes: sweetness and tartness. The real apple gave off a lovely strong aroma; the snack had very little apple scent at all, even if I stuck my nose into the bag immediately after opening it. Scent is a very important component of taste, and without it, the apple snack was just a dry, crunchy, sugar and tart taste.There is no doubt that dried apples are good for you, but any nutritionist would agree that in going from a fresh fruit to a dried product, a significant amount of enzymes, vitamins, and minerals are lost.

It contains Taiwanese green tea, aloe vera, citric acid, water, cane sugar and natural passion fruit, although the quantity of each ingredient is not specified.This fruity drink fulfills 38% of the daily requirement for vitamin C, but no significant amount of any other vitamin. No preservatives have been added. The label indicates 80 calories per serving, but defines a serving as 8 ounces. Because the bottle is 11.5 ounces, drinking a full bottle means an intake of 115 calories.Chantea won the Best New Product award in 2011 at the World Tea Trade Show. It also won Buyers' Choice and 2nd place Ready to Drink tea awards at the North American Tea Championship.Of the four available Chantea flavors (original, peach, lemon, passion fruit) I only tried passion fruit. My first reaction was surprise at the amount of pulp it contained. My second and sustained reaction was that the drink was tangy and tart - more than I would have liked. The taste is pleasant but rich and full-bodied - it reminded me of fresh grapefruit juice, but is a little sweeter.Although I may recommend it to friends and try another flavor, I am more inclined to drink acai blueberry vitamin water zero, which I find particularly delicious. However, these Chantea drinks offer a considerable additional benefit related to their aloe vera and green tea ingredients.Aloe vera is a succulent plant originating in Africa but now cultivated worldwide. Egyptian papyri reveal that it was used for healing as early as 16th century B.C.  Sources dating back to 1st century A.D. refer to its use in herbal medicine.Although no scientific evidence yet attests to its medicinal properties, aloe vera is widely associated with helping diabetes and elevated blood lipids, and improving glucose levels. It is most recommended for reducing symptoms of heartburn, irritable bowel syndrome, abdominal cramps, diarrhea and ulcerative colitis. It is an ingredient in yoghurt, and has no known side effects.Green tea, in contrast, has been the focus of dozens of scientific studies, although it has not been reviewed by the FDA. Made from the leaves of camellia senensis, which originated in China but is now cultivated worldwide, it contains antioxidative and anticarcinogenic flavonoids, as well as caffeine.Many studies suggest that:a) Lowers the risk of heart disease, cancer (breast, prostrate, colon), kidney stones, arthritis and dental cavitiesb) Boosts the metabolic rate 4-17%, helping reduce body fatc) Strengthens the immune system, and improves bone densityd) Reduces blood pressure and symptoms of depressione) Helps rescue damaged neurons and prevent brain cells from dying.Note however that the U.S. Pharmacopeia has warned that green tea in quantity does increase the risk of liver damage, especially when taken on an empty stomach. It is also contraindicated for use with the anti-cancer drug bortezomib, and it may reduce the effectiveness of anticoagulants.Those of you wanting a healthy, immune-boosting chilled fruity drink are likely to benefit from this product. However, taste is a very individual preference. If you like tart, full-bodied flavors, you may really enjoy Chantea's passion fruit green tea aloe vera drink. As for myself, I prefer a blander fruit drink. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3376, 3390)",1,0.0,False

Second, I LOVE chocolate and caramel--especially when combined together!  Third, I thought it would be fun to lampoon a research project for this review.With this knowledge in mind, I decided to take my bag of Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates out to the Veterans Administration (VA) Hospital were I am a volunteer with the VA's diet and healthy lifestyle program, MOVE! (please go to [...] for information).  I did this for several reasons: 1) I knew that my personal prejudice might result in a skewed review; 2) at 290 pounds, I need to eat a whole bag of chocolates like I need another hole in my head; 3) I truly wanted to share the surprising bounty of getting a bag of Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates with others; and, 4) as an experienced researcher, I could not pass up the opportunity to do a little ""research.""  Please let me make if perfectly clear that I fully acknowledge that this is NOT A SCIENTIFIC STUDY, which is why I surreptitiously entitled my review ""A 'Semi-Scientific' Survey....""  This is simply a fun way to share the wealth and get the opinions of others.  In this vein I will explain the ""methodological procedures"" I followed, as if this was a real survey.SAMPLE:  I offered a piece of Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates to a total of thirty people, seven of whom did not take a piece.  All seven were VA personnel, one of which was allergic to chocolate.  The others stated that they either did not like candy (including chocolate) or, after reading the nutritional label, stated the caramel chocolates were ""way too fattening for me.""  There are four registered nutritionists (several with Masters degrees) in the Nutrition Department at Fort Harrison VA, Montana, where I volunteer.  Besides them and myself, there is a part-time staff worker, a physical therapist (with a Doctorate), a veteran CWT worker, and one other volunteer working with the MOVE! program, all of whom took part.  In addition to these eight individuals, I gave a piece of Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates to four other VA employees and eleven randomly selected veterans/family members, for a total sample of twenty three people (not including myself--the 24th piece).  Out of this sample five stated that they did not really like chocolate and/or caramel very much (but were willing to sample the piece I offered them).  Three others, like myself, stated that they ""loved chocolate and caramel together.""TECHNIQUES: To collect my ""data,"" I cut each of the 12 pieces in half, and offered this sample piece of Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates to people at the VA, and asked them to tell me what they thought of the candy, recording their comments in my personal shorthand notes.  I then categorized each person into one of four categories that emerged from their comments: 1) liked the candy; 2) liked the candy, but...; 3) did not like the candy, but...; and 4) did not like the candy.  I have not bothered to do any data analysis.RESULTS:  Based upon the above categories, the numbers are as follows:Liked Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates:  17Liked Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates, but...  3Did not like Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates, but...  1Did not like Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates  2A few examples of comments made by those who liked the chocolates were: ""Very, very, very Good.  Delicious.  Smooth and rich.  And the smell is absolutely great!""  ""Loved it!  Really, really good.""  ""I like it!  The taste, the texture are great.""The two who liked the chocolate, but had reservations, commented:""Wonderful!  Very Good...It smells so wonderful.  Delicious, but one serving is half the recommended daily fat intake, and this one piece means I can't have any more fat today, as it is all my diet allows.""  ""They're good; better than their regular candy.  But it is too rich for me.""The one person who did not like the caramel chocolate, but had other thoughts stated: ""OK--especially if you like rich chocolate--but it is loaded with fat and just isn't tasty enough to compensate for all the fat in just one piece, let alone several.""The two who did not like the Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates had this to say:""Chocolate and caramel are my two favorite candy flavors, and they smell delicious.  Yet, while they taste creamy, they have a noticeable waxy texture and taste that overrides the initial taste and flavor.  Overall, I am sad to say I don't like them, nor would I ever buy them now that I have tried them.""  ""No. I do not like it.  Way too buttery, fatty, and waxy tasting for me.""CONCLUSIONS:  Overall, approximately 80% of those who chose to try a piece of Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates liked them.  Hence, I have rated this four out of five stars.  It should be noted however, that a number of people did not even try the candy when they saw the fat content.  Of those who really liked the chocolates, only four asked if they could have another piece.  When asked if they would buy them, only six of the seventeen said ""maybe"" or ""yes.""  There was, HOWEVER, one universal response (including those who refused to try a piece) to the Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates: ""They Smell Deliciously Wonderful.""For myself, the one ultimately responsible for this review, I found the Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates disappointing.  I have tried to figure this out: why don't I like this brand of one of my favorite candies?  While I cannot say for sure, I think it is because the enticing smell and hopeful taste are lost to all the different types of butter/butter extracts and fats used in the mixture.  That is to say, I think they put too much into the mixture, and, while the smell may be powerful, I cannot taste the caramel chocolate mixture.  To me, then, Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates are simply a very rich and creamy (to the point of being overbearing or waxy) candy that has no distinctive taste.  So, I am glad I passed the pieces out to get other people's opinions, although at this time (April 4, 2009) this item is currently unavailable.  And I had a great time doing my ""research.""

Many people are indulging in a gluten free lifestyle, some out of necessity and some out of curiosity.  I have friends who do this, and while some of the gluten free products available are palatable, I have found that more often than not they are off putting.  I was excited to see if this `care package' contained any pleasant surprises, but overall it just reaffirmed by previous belief; that gluten free is not for me.Let's take these one at a time.Blueberry Pomegranate Trail Mix Crunch:Flavor-wise, this is pretty good.  There isn't much in the package though, and the clusters are rather large.  They are also very sticky and leave a residue on your fingers.  Like I said, they tasted good (not very strong in the pomegranate flavor, but very nutty and blueberry tasting) but they also had a strong resemblance to `healthy cereal', so keep that in mind before purchasing.Multi-Seed Crackers:Crunchy and satisfying; these crackers taste slightly `healthy' but they also have some interesting flavors that give it a distinct and memorable taste.  I had to get used to them, but after a few bites I was hooked.Steak Nuggets + Cheese:This box contains a little meal.  The beef steak nuggets are a bit like jerky but they have a bland aftertaste.  They are chewy, but predictably so; despite the promise that they are `more tender'.  The Multi-Seed crackers are the same already provided in a larger bag.  When you lather on the Parmesan Peppercorn cheese spread, it takes those crackers to another level.  It's a great flavor, but I will say that it is a tad runny as apposed to creamy.  I'm kind of obsessed with ginger in general, so this Ginger Zip fruit and nut mix is phenomenally good.  I know that seems a tad excessive, but you can't go wrong with banana, cranberries and GINGERED PEANUTS!  Oh, and to finish off the `meal', you have an Almond Roca, which is always delicious.Sheffa Zesty Snack Mix:I was really excited about this.  The mix on the cover of the package looks amazing.  I've had chickpea fries before and I loved them.  Roasted corn and toasted seeds sounded like the perfect way to round out the snack.  Opening the package and peering inside I was turned off completely.  It looked like animal food.  The chickpea noodles are about five times smaller than they appear on the cover.  The taste is also extremely bland and almost too earthy.  It was kind of like chewing on twigs.  I think I've said enough about this one.Popchips, Barbeque Potato:Now these are kind of great.  They have a great airy texture that sits well on the tongue.  The flavor is strong on the outset, but one thing that is a slight detractor is that the flavor does dissipate quickly.  So, yes; the chips aren't perfect, but they are uniquely inviting, and that airy consistency really makes for a light and tangy snack.Sharkies, Watermelon Scream:There is an artificial flavor here that I'm not a gigantic fan of.  It kind of tastes like sugar substitute; a cloyingly sweet aftertaste.  That said, there is a lot of flavor here.  It is a robust flavor, so it has that going for it.  If you don't mind that faux-sugar taste then you should really enjoy these.  I could definitely taste the watermelon, which is nice (I love the flavor).Wild Garden Hummus:On its own, this garbanzo bean dip is a tad too; sweet?  I think that's the sensation I'm getting from this.  It just seems off.  It actually has an almost sour tang to it, like something that has gone bad.  But, when lathered onto one of those multi-seed crackers it is actually masked enough by the earthiness of the cracker to give off a pleasantly balanced bean flavor.Emergen-C Raspberry Fizzy Drink Mix:I love the taste of raspberries, but I have to tell you that I have a strong aversion to these types of drinks.  They always taste chalky and artificial to me and this one really isn't an exception to that rule.  It is void of much flavor, but it certainly smacks the back of your throat with that sweetened fizz.In the end, I can't recommend this to anyone who doesn't need to cut gluten out of their diet.  It just isn't worth it.  But, if you need to find gluten free alternatives to foods you love, then this may be something you'll enjoy.  The Popchips and the crackers are pretty good, and those gingered peanuts are still calling my name. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(4365, 4379)",1,0.0,False

The crackers are fine, but the cheese paste tastes like a science experiment instead of real cheese.  I know you can't expect real cheese in a prepackaged, non-refrigerated snack like this one, but there's decent artificial cheese flavor and bad artificial cheese flavor, and this is definitely the latter.  (Also, the box reads ""Natural Flavors with Other Natural Flavors"", which is a pet peeve of mine - it sounds silly.  Just say ""Natural Flavors"" already!  It's like saying ""Rainy with a chance of showers"" in the weather report.)In terms of nutritional information, there's 7 grams of fat per serving, which is high, but 4.5 of those are unsaturated fats, which is more acceptable but still high. On the plus side, 5 grams of fiber per serving is great.The main draw of this product is the convenience of the packaging. Let's be honest: for the same amount of money, you can buy a box of crackers and some REAL cheddar cheese and have a much more natural, less processed, better tasting end result - but you'd have to keep the cheese refrigerated and put the snack together yourself, whereas you can just throw a couple of these pre-made and wrapped packages in your backpack and have a quick snack handy in case your toddler runs out of fuel when you're out and about. For a kid's snack, it's sure to be a hit, because it's convenient and not too unhealthy. I'd even consider buying it again for my 3 year old. But for adults, I'd have to think there are tastier and healthier ways to get cheese-on-a-cracker than this.Additional note: my wife adds that she actually liked the taste of the cheese. In her opinion, if you like the cheese that's in the other Ritz cheese-and-crackers products, it tastes exactly the same and you won't be disappointed.  I confess to not having a ton of experience with Ritz cheese spread, so maybe it's just that I'm a cheese snob :) So, second opinion from my better half: this isn't any worse than other Ritz crackers with cheese paste.

My wife and I try to eat as healthy as possible, so this cereal appealed to me since I've had similar cereals by other brands. I think this is a far superior product than many others I've tried.The flakes in this cereal are very thick and very crunchy. They maintain their crunch even after sitting in milk for about five minutes. The flakes are coated in flavoring, and the primary flavor is honey. It's a pleasant honey flavor -- not bitter and not too sweet. The box claims that vanilla extract is used -- although I can only taste the slightest hint of vanilla. Overall, the flavor is good and after eating a bowl, there's only a slight honey aftertaste.It's important to note that this cereal contains dried strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries. The raspberries and blackberries are typically whole, while the strawberries are halves, quarters, or just pieces. They hydrate when they sit in the milk, and they have a good texture -- and they don't fall apart. Unfortunately, the quantity of berries is low -- expect about less than 5% by volume per box. When you pour a bowl of cereal, you might get 2 or 3 berries in the bowl, per 1-cup serving.From a nutritional standpoint, I'm satisfied but there is room for improvement. The calorie content is slightly higher than I expected -- 210 calories per 1-cup serving. Depending on what type of milk you use, a single-serving can be 250-300 calories. Fat content is only 0.5g.  Carbohydrates are somewhat on the high-side: 46g total per cup, with 5g of dietary fiber (20% for a 2,000 calorie diet). I attribute the high carb content to the sugars -- the flakes contain ""malted barley syrup"", ""evaporated cane juice"" and ""molasses"", while the second overall ingredient listed is ""brown sugar"".  If they could cut back on the sugar content, this product could be perfect.Overall, this is a quality product that I enjoy. I would not eat this every day, but it is good 2 or 3 times per week.

In our home corner of the desert Southwest, quite near the world-famous chili pepper fields of Hatch, New Mexico, chilis make up a major part of the local culinary scene. The Chili Pepper Institute at New Mexico State University, just up the road in Las Cruces, cultivates ever-hotter varieties of chili peppers from around the world. One of their latest finds is the Bhut Jolokia, which is many times hotter than the jalape&ntilde;o. In fact, we don't even buy jalape&ntilde;os any more--they're far too mild. Instead, we always have hotter serranos on hand to sprinkle on just about every meal, as well as our annual 30 pounds of roasted Hatch hot green chilis. We also always have a few bottles of hot pepper sauce in the pantry. Currently three bottles of Tabasco are in there--regular, garlic and haba&ntilde;ero. Thus, as a certified chili pepper fanatic, I leaped at the chance to try Gringo Bandito hot sauce when it showed up as a Vine selection.I've never been that impressed with hot sauces other than Tabasco. I prefer the clean, simple formulation of the classic products from Avery Island, Louisiana. Many of the other hot sauces we've tried in the past have had long lists of ingredients, which just dilute the pure chili pepper goodness. Gringo Bandito hot sauce is a happy medium. It has more ingredients than regular Tabasco, but not as many as some other brands--or, indeed, as the haba&ntilde;ero Tabasco, which has everything in it but the kitchen sink. Gringo Bandito's extra ingredients are all good. Near the top of the ingredient list are ""haba&ntilde;ero peppers, jalape&ntilde;o peppers, red Japanese chili peppers, more peppers...""So how does it taste? Well, taste is of course highly subjective, so if I say, ""It tastes great,"" that doesn't really mean anything. What's great to me may be horrible to someone else. Right up front, Gringo Bandito has the characteristic, distinctive, unmistakable haba&ntilde;ero taste. And it IS very hot. A few dollops added excellent flavor and spiciness to black-eyed-pea soup and Polish hunter's stew. In a side-by-side taste test with haba&ntilde;ero Tabasco, some differences stood out. Gringo Bandito is less hot than Tabasco, and it has a more one-dimensional flavor profile. In the comparison, it seems a little ""bland"" (as much as that can apply to a haba&ntilde;ero pepper sauce).But I don't mean that as a complaint. In fact, based on how it transformed the dishes we tested it in, Gringo Bandito is a tasty hot pepper sauce that will find a permanent place in our pantry, right next to the Tabascos.

In fact, that's how Switch bills itself: A perfect balance between juice and carbonation. That's my rave over this new drink.Now here's my reluctance to embrace the drink with five stars. I poured the 8.3 fluid ounces into a small glass (I have a huge collection of mismatched, but adorable clear glasses of all sizes, including this little bowl wine glass I removed from a college cafeteria in France many years ago). The glass held the contents of this tall, thin can of cheery cherry drink perfectly. But wait, by the time I quaffed the contents, I held the glass askance and asked: Is that all? I want more!In comparison my favorite beverage, Zero Sprite, holds 12 fluid ounces, a perfect amount to quench my thirst after a few hours working in the yard. I add ice to Sprite and don't care if it is watered down, but this Black Cherry Switch? No, one does not want to water down this exotic flavor. It must be drunk straight.As for its can slogan: ""100% of what you want and 0% of what you don't,"" I'm not sure about that. Let's examine it. ""What you want"" is ""100% juice, 100% RDA Vitamin C, All natural, Carbonated, Great taste and refreshment."" I agree with all of those. So far, so good.Let's look at ""what you don't"" want: ""No sugar added, No corn syrup, No preservatives, No artificial colors, and Gluten free."" True on all those.Next the label. This is where it gets confusing. Total fat 0g, Sodium 15mg, Total Carbs 35g, Sugar 33g, Protein 0g, and 130 calories. The 33 grams of sugar can be confusing. If none was added, then the 33g must come with the natural juice. And Switch does bill itself on 100% juice.In comparison my Sprite can contains 38g of sugar and 140 calories. I thought Zero Sprite contained zero sugar. My bad. I didn't read the label. It is free of caffeine, fat, cholesterol, fiber, Vitamin A and Vitamin C, but no mention of sugar, which I assume comes from the corn syrup.I'm no nutritionist, but it seems that drinking Switch is much better than drinking a Zero Sprite, except that the can is larger so you get more.I would change those four stars to five now, except 8.3 Fl OZ still is not quite enough for one drink.Will I switch? No, but I will add Black Cherry Switch to my fridge for an occasional delightfully refreshing drink when I don't need more.

However, based on their recipes, and a normal amount a kid would eat, they might get 1/2 a serving of vegetables in the end. Which while better that nothing, amounts to not much more. 1 big carrot has more calories and nutritional value than 1 whole packet of these carrot blend ins.The mac and cheese recipe was pretty good, you can feel it adds a little bit of sweetness and thickness to the sauce, any kid that likes mac and cheese would most likely love it too, and don't really know what it had. This is why I gave it 3 stars instead of two.Given that each packet doesn't have much nutritional value, and that we are in fact hiding veggies from children, I feel like it's a counter productive product.

While I know it's not politically correct, as I stated in my in other reviews of K cups and the machine itself, this is one of my few bad habits, so deal with it.Now that Keurig's patent has expired, everybody is jumping on the ""K cup bandwagon."" Many of these new entries are priced considerably lower per K cup than those that use ""Official K Cups"" licensed from Keurig. So how do you tell if any of these roasters make a blend worth drinking? Sample packs of course! It's the perfect way to try blends from a roaster you may not have heard of. With that in mind I was pleased to find this sample pack from Brooklyn Beans. Having two or three samples of several blends makes it fun to compare and contrast Brooklyn Beans with those from other firms, especially the standardbearer, Green Mountain Coffee Roasters.The MethodI prefer ""fuller flavored"" coffees while Mrs. Boilermate will drink just about anything. To evaluate these blends both Mrs. Boilermate and I sampled each blend. I drink my coffee with half and half and sugar while she drinks hers black. Even with these differences we generally agreed on the final result. This is how we evaluated this sample pack: The B145 allows you to make a six, eight, or ten ounce cup. If there were three samples of a blend other than ""extra bold,"" I made a 12 ounce cup using 2K cups and 6 ounces of water each, and Mrs. Boilermate made a cup with one K cup and 8 ounces. If there were only two samples of a blend we both made them with 8 ounces of water. The only exception was for blends marked ""extra bold."" These were all made with one K cup and 10 ounces of water. All flavored coffees were made with one K cup and eight ounces of water.So, how do the Brooklyn Beans blend stack up? Well, not surprisingly, we both brought some were very good, some are were average, and others we wouldn't drink again if someone stuck hot needles under our fingernails.The CupsThese cups (the container, not the coffee) are as good as any K cups out there. They mimic the style of Keurig's K Cup, and this is not a bad thing, as each capsule keeps the coffee fresh until you brew it. None of the cups in my sample pack were crushed, split, or damaged in any way. They fit my machine perfectly, pierced cleanly, and worked as designed.AromaWhile the coffee was brewing, most blends had little discernible aroma. The only notable differences here were the Breakfast Blend and the Breakfast Blend Decaf. Both of these filled the room with delicious coffee aroma while the coffee was brewing. In the cup, the aroma was pretty good for most blends. A notable exception here was the Corner Donut Shop Blend, which smelled burnt.TasteFrom a taste standpoint, there were more hits than misses. Surprisingly, we both rated the Colombian blend only ""Okay."" Normally, this is a blend most roasters seem to be able to do quite well. The most liked blends were Fuhgeddaboutit, Breakfast, and Breakfast Decaf. The biggest miss was the Corner Donut Shop Blend that not only tasted weak but smelled burnt, as previously noted, and also tasted burnt. While Cyclone is billed as ""extra bold"" neither of us thought it was particularly bold. My notes said, ""A bit weak for a dark, extra bold roast. Three out of five stars."" Mrs. Boilermate said, ""Okay, but not worth paying a premium for.""I'm not generally disposed to flavored coffees, but these flavored roasts were pretty good. Mrs. Boilermate thought so too with the exception of Cinnamon Subway, to which she commented, ""Cinnamon doesn't go with coffee."" OTOH, I thought it was a good combination.  I was skeptical about what maple in coffee would be like, but I thought the Maple Sleigh was a really good blend. It was my favorite of all the flavored coffees.SourcingThere is nothing on the package or on Brooklyn Beans' website that indicates where they source their beans from. Given a choice, we prefer to buy our coffee from roasters whose beans are sourced from certified Fair Trade (or similar organizations) suppliers, and we are willing to pay extra for it. Roasters who use such beans normally highlight this as a selling point. Since there is no such mention by Brooklyn Beans I would assume they are not.Bottom LineBased solely on price and taste, Brooklyn Beans blends compete favorably with other brands of K cups. Fuhgeddaboutit and Breakfast Blend compared very favorably to our current favorites, GMCR's Dark Magic and Colombian respectively. With a few exceptions, the sample pack was well-liked in our household. At the time of this writing they cost about $.55 apiece, which is about the same as we pay for Green Mountain K cups, but finding competitively priced single blend packs in the varieties we like is a bit more challenging.Given the choice between roasters who use certified Fair Trade or similarly certified beans and those who don't, we will normally choose those that do. Having said that, some of Brooklyn Beans' blends will make it into our rotation. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(5004, 5018)",1,0.0,False

You know the kind I mean, when you burp and anyone within 20 or 30 yards of you is running for fresh air. I also didn't get any real aftertaste when drinking it either.Now coming in at 8.3 ounces, the calories in this drink are reported at 135 calories per can. By comparison, a 12 ounce can of Pepsi comes in at 150 calories per can. So, on the calorie front I wouldn't say that there is much of a difference between this drink and Pepsi, although if you do the math, this drink would actually have more calories than Pepsi if you compared them in equal amounts. However, if you look at the list of ingredients in both, you can see where this product is far better for you than your traditional sodas, although obviously not as good for you as drinking an actual 100% pure fruit or vegetable juice.To put in plainly and succinctly, this is a really good tasting beverage and is definitely one I would consider drinking over the more traditional sodas that are currently available. However, the one primary detractor to this is the size of the can compared to the price.The one thing that I had not quite decided on whether it is a negative or a positive is the size of the can, which as I stated earlier comes in at 8.3 ounces compared to your traditional cans of soda that come in at 12 ounces. In addition to the size of the can, there is also the consideration of price, coming in at roughly $1.00 per can which is considerably more expensive than your average can of soda. Therefore, when you take the size of the product combined with the price, I would have to say that it is a definite negative, although this one tasted so good to me that I will definitely be purchasing this product.Shawn KovacichCreator of numerous books and DVD's.

They have slightly less sugar (7 g vs 8-10 for other brands), significantly less sodium (130 g vs 200 and up), slightly more fiber, slightly fewer calories (about 15 cal fewer per serving).

I had more energy through the night shift and didn't have that much of a drop when it was running down.

The second time we tried the crackers, we found them quite good--sweet but not cloying. The crackers are a little bit dry, I think that is because of some of the missing artificial ingredients.

In addition to being Certified Organic, this bar is gluten-free and vegan. Furthermore, the Wild Blueberry flavor contains a full serving of fruit, is a good source of fiber (3 grams), and provides Omega-3s as well. There is also a decent amount of protein (6 grams, slightly less than the Cherry Cashew bar), and although the amount of sugar is higher than I would've liked (19 grams, or almost 4 teaspoons), the bar is naturally sweetened using agave nectar only, with no other added sugars added.The bar was thick and dense in appearance, with an almost slightly sticky feel. The taste definitely tastes fruity, but I could not detect a blueberry flavor at all.  Rather, as other reviewers have suggested, the taste is more reminiscent of Fig Newtons, most likely because the first ingredient is actually dates (blueberries were significantly further down the list).  The bar also did have a nutty flavor, and in fact it contains cashews, walnuts, and almonds.  Overall, I liked the taste (I like dates!), but I thought the ""Wild Blueberry"" label was deceiving, and I definitely have had other bars that I prefer.In the end, I liked the Cherry Cashew Pure Bar a bit more than this one, and I would rate the nutritional profile of that flavor as slightly better as well.

My wife and I try to eat as healthy as possible, so this cereal appealed to me since I've had similar cereals by other brands. I think this is a far superior product than many others I've tried.The flakes in this cereal are very thick and very crunchy. They maintain their crunch even after sitting in milk for about five minutes. The flakes are coated in flavoring, and the primary flavor is honey. It's a pleasant honey flavor -- not bitter and not too sweet. The box claims that vanilla extract is used -- although I can only taste the slightest hint of vanilla. Overall, the flavor is good and after eating a bowl, there's only a slight honey aftertaste.It's important to note that this cereal contains dried strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries. The raspberries and blackberries are typically whole, while the strawberries are halves, quarters, or just pieces. They hydrate when they sit in the milk, and they have a good texture -- and they don't fall apart. Unfortunately, the quantity of berries is low -- expect about less than 5% by volume per box. When you pour a bowl of cereal, you might get 2 or 3 berries in the bowl, per 1-cup serving.From a nutritional standpoint, I'm satisfied but there is room for improvement. The calorie content is slightly higher than I expected -- 210 calories per 1-cup serving. Depending on what type of milk you use, a single-serving can be 250-300 calories. Fat content is only 0.5g.  Carbohydrates are somewhat on the high-side: 46g total per cup, with 5g of dietary fiber (20% for a 2,000 calorie diet). I attribute the high carb content to the sugars -- the flakes contain ""malted barley syrup"", ""evaporated cane juice"" and ""molasses"", while the second overall ingredient listed is ""brown sugar"".  If they could cut back on the sugar content, this product could be perfect.Overall, this is a quality product that I enjoy. I would not eat this every day, but it is good 2 or 3 times per week.

This just sort of seemed a natural fit for me as far as a vine review goes.The good thing is that the texture to these are pretty good. It's nice & chewy without being too chewy or too soft. It's a happy medium, although I do recommend that you try to get these as fresh as possible since I can't imagine trying to eat these when they've a little old or have been exposed to air & not stored properly.The bad thing is that these just have this funky aftertaste to them. The basic taste is fine enough. It doesn't taste like pomegranate & normally I'd be OK with this since candy often labels things ""watermelon"" or ""strawberry"" when it doesn't taste anything remotely like the fruit. Since this is supposed to be mostly organic & natural, I really expected it to taste more like actual pomegranate. Then there's the occasional weird aftertaste these have to them that's somewhat unpleasant. I can't really explain it but it's not a taste that I'd really care to have in my mouth.One thing I do want to mention is that out of the 11 ingredients in this product, only 3 are organic. That doesn't bother me much, but I know that there are some people who get irritated at how some labels mention ""organic"" but only a small part of it is actually organic. At that point you really can't call the product organic since it has non-organic product in it. (There's no USDA organic label on this anywhere, if you were wondering, which can only be put on if a certain percentage of the product is organic.) Note that this product didn't have ""made with organic ingredients"" on it, just ""made with organic sugar"". The people who label watch for organic products will know what that means. I mention all of this because I know some are very picky about product that have organic anywhere on it.Overall I wasn't really that enthusiastic about this product. It wasn't horrible but I can safely say that I probably won't be buying any of these in the future. I might & I stress *might* try one of the other flavors, but that'd only be if the price was right.EDIT:Updated to say that I won't be buying any of this in the future. The licorice I ate later is really making me feel a little gross. Like another reviewer said, it's just sitting there like a pile of lead & is giving me some pretty bad indigestion.

There is no flavor meaning, no lemon or apple or ginger flavor. Taste?  sure there is a metallic taste that I am not fond of.Most of us know that caffeine has a bitter taste ergo the metallic taste in this water. How do you get rid of the bitter taste? and if  you can why don't they do it for coffee and tea?To say this water is delicious is a bit of a stretch for me,  if, as they say it has no flavor and no taste,  how can it be delicious? To be delicious there must be a taste or flavor,Now my second part: what is the point?  This  just my opinion, that is what I was given this product for. I don't get the point.It has no flavor, no taste.  It has some bitter caffeine, why do you need caffeine to give you a lift?.  And if you need a lift why use bitter caffeine?I gave it 3 stars because it was wet cold and did not taste terrible, it just didn't taste.You could drink filtered water and have a nice fruit to give you a lift and get some vitamins from it.I just finished the bottle and find there is a slight lift but in a way that I do not find comfortable.  If you like caffeine and water then this may be your thing. Drink it to get a lift.But for me I will drink my filtered water and have a nice slice of ice cold watermelon to give me my lift for the day and I bet I will enjoy it a lot more than drinking this.Now I must say that as I am writing this my heart is reacting to the caffeine, so be careful if you are sensitive.  If you are not then this is the drink for you,.As a fellow reviewer said ""go buy caffeine tabs and mix with tap water' they are cheaper and don't waste plastic bottles.

A fresh apple is going to beat a processed snack any time. However, sometimes, it's not feasible to have fresh fruit on hand or you need something which will travel well and not weigh you down as much. This is good to have in your desk, a backpack, or in your car for a quick snack, but it is essentially dried apples in a different form. If you like dried apples a little, you may like this just a bit more.The main selling point of this over dried apples is that it's crunchier and the little round balls are more fun to eat. They have an intense apple flavor brought on by the apple bits and the concentrated apple juice. The juice gives them a fair amount of sweetness and the little morsels are held together with potato starch. The main disappointment I have with these is that the cinnamon is far too subdued. This is my personal preference, of course. I didn't really detect any cinnamon until around the 3rd bite when it had built up enough intensity on my tongue to be present.If you like dried apples, these may do it for you. They are intense, but all dried fruit is. I thought they were okay, but I wouldn't go out of my way to have them again. Some snacks are the type of thing that I'd eat if someone offered them to me, but I wouldn't tend to buy them for myself. This is one of those.

To my mind, the pasta is usually just a vehicle for whatever topping we're going to put on it! That said, however, Barilla has become our most common choice over the last few years. Why? A couple of reasons, really. Price-wise, this is usually one of the more economical choices. The pasta is reliable and tasty, the variety is impressive, there is a whole grain option, and there is even a new PLUS line for those looking to increase their protein intake.Recently, I received a whole slew of Barilla to try out. Some of these are regulars on my table (like the Whole Grain) and some were first time uses. Again, though, Barilla is a brand I swear by and use almost every week. I just find it hard to gush about food products.Whole Grain Spaghetti (4 1/2 stars): We frequently opt for the whole grain option, I suppose it seems like the healthier alternative. As we've gotten older, we've consciously tried to up our fiber intake and this does so in a pleasant way. Made with 51% whole wheat, we also think these are tastier than traditional pasta. Typical spaghetti preparation.Whole Grain Thin Spaghetti (5 stars): A thinner choice, this gives you the benefits of the whole grains and fiber but mixes better with sauces.Whole Grain Linguine: (5 Stars): One of out preferred choices.  Obviously, we are crazy for the Whole grain option, but like the flat linguine as the option that works best for think and rich sauces.Mezze Penne (4 stars): We eat a surprising amount of Penne and this Mezze is slightly thinner in cylindrical format. Cooks up and maintains its shape well. We often do baked dishes where we cook the pasta first, then bake it. Even double prepared, they hold their shape well and taste good. Better integrity under these circumstances than the wider penne.Linguine Fini (4 1/2 stars): These delineations amuse me. It had never occurred to me that I needed an even thinner Linguine, so (of all of these choices) this was probably the one I wouldn't have tried on my own. But we tend to like this (angel hair is one of our top choices), so this was tasty enough.Oven Ready Lasagna (4 stars): I don't do lasagna very often and never from scratch! If you are a short-cut cook like me, you want things to make your life easier. These noodles don't require any pre-boiling and cook while the dish is baking. It's a brilliant idea that works well for the most part. Due to inconsistencies in layering, you might have sections that crisp up more than others. But a little unevenness is a willing trade for the pain of making traditional lasagna.Ditalini Soup Cuts (4 stars): This is one of the products that I probably wouldn't have picked up of my own accord. I'm simply not a soup maker. But these little pasta cylinders were actually very nice, and super easy to use. We added them to a crock pot preparation. I was afraid they might dissolve completely, but they held up well and added a nice dimesion.Penne Plus (4 stars): This is like the premium choice in Barilla, and so it is more expensive. It's not my first choice. But it would appeal to those that are looking to add protein to their diet, like vegetarians. It has protein and Omega 3's, and is made with healthy ingredients like flax seed and legumes. It takes a little longer to cook, but still tastes fine. KGHarris, 3/12.

It pours dark and thick and even leaves a little frothiness on the side of the container I'm pouring into. The coffee still leaves a bit of a metallic aftertaste, however.Look:As mentioned, the coffee is dark... really dark.

I actually like my coffee stronger and this fits the bill pretty nicely.Aroma:This actually smells like fresh brewed coffee.

It's easy to make, and has generally healthy ingredients.A container provides about 2 1/2 ounces of food. The base component is oatmeal, and they add in almonds, pistachios, and cherries. Note that this means the flavor will be a bit sour, from the cherries. Some people are OK with this. Others won't enjoy it. So this is definitely something you should try first before you buy a twelve pack of it. It might be perfect for you - or the flavor might not be one you enjoy.We did like the flavor, and we liked the fresh ingredients. But, that being said, the price on Amazon is over $2 a serving, which is fairly expensive. ""Regular"" oatmeal can be 50 cents a packet or even less. You could easily customize that oatmeal to be exactly the way you want.But of course, many people are so pressed for time that they only have coffee for breakfast. That is REALLY unhealthy. Many studies show that you should start the day with a meal of some sort, to give your body the nutrients it needs to metabolize properly until lunch. So if you're currently eating nothing at all, and a better breakfast just isn't possible with your schedule, then at least this instant-eat meal is a better solution.Nutrition wise, again this isn't great but it's certainly better than what many people eat (or don't eat) for breakfast. 290 calories, 8g fat, 180mg sodium, and a whopping 49g of carbs. Sure, 5g of that is fiber, but a large 19g of that is sugar. That's a lot of sugar to be pouring into your mouth the first thing in the day. You also get 9g protein. In terms of vitamins, you barely get anything.So overall I'd always suggest eating something HEALTHY for breakfast. Something with protein, nutrition, and what your body actually needs to get its muscles and blood working properly. Something with vitamin and minerals.

He preferred the darker roast coffees which is typical for him.I like flavored coffees. The Oh Fudge! was my favorite. I will be ordering more of that flavor. The caramel was very delicious. The vanilla was good but light on the vanilla. The cinnamon was good. The taste was like you had sprinkled your coffee with ground cinnamon right out of the shaker. I was really dreading to try the Maple Sleigh since I don't care for maple flavors but it was OK. It had a strong maple scent when it was making but it did not have a strong maple flavor in the coffee. That could be good or bad depending on what you are looking for. I don't care for Hazelnut but I don't like any Hazelnut coffees, just a personal preference.Overall, the coffee was very good and the variety in this pack was excellent.Dear Brooklyn Bean Roastery, please make a coconut or coconut-mocha flavor.

Sure, it's lightly carbonated, but that alone doesn't make this drink a soda.  Also, if you wanted something natural, I'd go with Hansen's sodas, or a number of natural sodas, which are definitely sodas.  This drink is basically juice with carbonation.The other notable issue I had with this was its size.  8.3 oounces doesn't get you far (3 gulps, maybe?), and coupled with the thickness of the drink (since it IS juice, with quite a bit of natural sugar), you don't get very much thirst quenching effect from this.  The 100% juice also accounts for the strong aftertaste.Finally, natural sugar is still sugar, and has just as many calories.  This stuff wouldn't make the cut in most school vending policies, with its high sugar content.  And I wouldn't give this to my kids.

It was delicious, with the chicken being very moist and tender, and the seasoning was very tasty and savory without being overpowering.

In my opinion, unless you have some side dishes, most folks will want more than one eighth of the chicken. Really, it's that good. The only thing I would change would be to reduce the amount of salt in the seasoning. The package lists 300mg of sodium per serving, so the whole dish includes 2,400mg of sodium.

VERY glad I did!First, coffee is definitely a personal taste kind of thing.  I really don't like the bitter over-roasted ""charred"" flavor of some (sorry, Starbucks), but I do like a lot of flavor.  Some folks love that ""dark roasted"" bitter flavor, but I'm not one of them.  Give me a decent rich full-bodied medium roast, and I'm one happy camper.Second, I like both ""plain"" and flavored coffees.  I'm particularly partial to cinnamon, but also like hazelnut, caramel, even blueberry.  Really, I'm game for just about anything.OK, so about this selection:  You get a LOT of different flavors, and you get 2-3 cups per flavor.  So far, I've tried 5 different flavors (Columbian, Fuhgeddaboutit, cinnamon, Boardwalk Blend, and Hazelnut).  Frankly, I've liked all of them.  I usually stay away from ""dark roast,"" but Fuhgeddaboutit was really nice -- definitely a ""dark"" roast, but without that overpowering bitterness I usually find so offensive.  I wouldn't say it's a new favorite, but it's definitely one I could drink again.  Of this group, so far I'd have to say Boardwalk Blend is my favorite -- but I still have several other flavors to try, so I may change my mind.Really, this would be a good ""trial"" package to test out the different flavors available from Brooklyn Beans.

I stirred about every 45 seconds to 1 minute during the first 7-minute cooking time and just barely caught the pasta from sticking too much to the pan.

I tasted it straight from the bar, and it is very, very dark with hardly any sweetness at all. It was bitter but not overly harsh. It's obviously good quality chocolate so I can't fault them for that, I simply prefer something a little sweeter. I can't see myself craving a piece of this to eat. I don't even think I would eat it for health purposes.I went to Scharffen Berger's website to see if there were any recipes for this chocolate, but all I could find was one for lace sandwich cookies (with the chocolate in the middle) and a pecan tart.

That smell of cheese hit me in the face.  But not cheese - specifically, it smelled of cheese-whiz.  That stuff was awesome - when I was in college.  You know cheese-whiz?  I used to love spraying that junk on RITZ crackers on college while watching TV.But I'm not in college anymore.After the strong smell of fake-cheese hits you, a hint of wheat makes itself known.  That's the cracker part of these things.I pulled out the ""crakerfull"" only to have it come apart in my hand.  I'm not kidding - the cheese-like-substance isn't strong enough to hold the crackers together.  As I pressed down (very lightly) on one end, the whole thing flipped open.  I had to squish it down to keep it together.Taste: It tastes just like you'd expect: it tastes like the american cheese-whiz stuff on ""wheat"" crackers that have that grainy texture to them.  They're not terrible - but I wouldn't say they're good.  I had one as a snack, and was hungry shortly afterwards.  I would have originally thought maybe I can take these golfing which I like to do with things like this - but they don't taste that good, and they don't hold you over for very long.* I have no idea why the RITZ logo is on these.  RITZ crackers are utterly distinctive in their own right.  They have a specific taste and texture unlike any other cracker made in America.  These things are nothing like a RITZ product, and I have no idea why they would associate the RITZ brand with some pseudo-cheese product on wheat-ish cracker boards.-So, yeah, I didn't really like them.

One recommendation:  Stick to the instructions to the tee.  When they say ""simmer & stir often"", they mean very often.  The pasta sticks to the pan if you do not stir it often enough.  I stirred about every 45 seconds to 1 minute during the first 7-minute cooking time and just barely caught the pasta from sticking too much to the pan.  The reason I placed broccoli in quotations in the title is that the teeny-tiny packet of freeze-dried broccoli once placed in the dish near the end of the cooking time becomes pretty much non-existent.

I didn't expect this, but I like that it is (it's hard to find a cold coffee in a can sans milk and sugar). The coffee is surprisingly creamy on the first sip. It has a full taste that hits the back of my tongue particularly well. It lacks the bitterness I might otherwise assume with many cold coffees but it does leave a metallic aftertaste (as well as what seems to be grapefruit).Pour:I'm pouring it into a mug and I am pleasantly surprised with how concentrated the coffee seems to be. It pours dark and thick and even leaves a little frothiness on the side of the container I'm pouring into. The coffee still leaves a bit of a metallic aftertaste, however.Look:As mentioned, the coffee is dark... really dark. I would think that if you like weaker coffee, you could dilute this and be fine with the results. I actually like my coffee stronger and this fits the bill pretty nicely.Aroma:This actually smells like fresh brewed coffee. Again, this surprises me.Overall:I'm really impressed by the quality of this product. Regarding my own biases, I usually brew my own coffee using fresh ground beans in a Chemex or a pour-over. This won't give you the same quality as that sort of process (obviously), but I would stack this above other cold coffee canned drinks I've had. The illy issimo provides a surprisingly rich taste, a satisfying dark color and density, and an fine aroma. Altogether, I am very pleased with this cold coffee. Still, it's hard for me to give it a ""five"" (call me a coffee snob if you will); a five would need to reproduce what I do myself very well (or better). Still, this is better than other coffee drinks I've had and I would buy it before the green mermaid or the orange and pink donut shop any day.

I was interested in trying Puerh because I had recently heard an interview about ""China's Dark Teas"" on The Splendid Table (google-able). I tried both the ginger and cardamom flavors.Traditional puerh comes in cakes or loose leaves, and is supposed to be ""rinsed"" for 10-20 seconds in hot water to remove impurities and start the tea opening.  Then steeped for about 30 seconds per cup (and the leaves can be re-steeped in more cups).  [Find out more about traditional puerh on the TeaSource page for puerh.]In contrast, the instructions on the package of teabags just say to steep for 3-5 minutes.  Does this tea have some sort of pre-processing that eliminates the traditional rinsing, or did they just used boiler plate instructions? -- the box doesn't say.  However, I didn't detect any major difference in the flavor of the rinsing water (15 seconds) and the cup of tea steeped for 3 minutes, so it doesn't seem that this tea needs the traditional pre-steeping.  The color was quite dark, but the flavor was much more mellow than some other plain black tea brewed to the same darkness.Of the two teas, the cardamom flavor was nice, but the ginger flavor was pretty minimal.  Without the spice, the 3-minute steeps would be too weak for my taste, lacking the fragrance and depth of, say, a good English Breakfast tea, but the cardamom rounded out the overall flavor.  So I would recommend getting the cardamom flavor rather than ginger.I steeped a second cup of each flavor after the first, for 2 minutes, and while the second cup of each was weaker, the spice flavor was a bit stronger in proportion, especially the ginger.  So to get relatively more spice flavor, you might need to steep for the full 5 minutes.  The second cup from the same teabag was sufficiently weaker that it doesn't seem like you could get many cups out of it, as described on the TeaSource page for traditional puerh tea.

Also unfortunately, while the box says it holds ""single serve pods"" it does not specify that they're pods for a machine, or in fact what machines they work with.  The packets themselves say nothing at all about pods or machines.So here's the problem: I have a box of single serve coffee pods which don't really tell me much of anything, requested because I thought they were simply single-serve coffee bags, not unlike tea bags.  And I don't own a pod coffee maker.  I don't like them very much.  I'm going to have to improvise in order to do any sort of review.I tossed a couple of pods into my standard drip coffee maker and added two cups of water (The classic 6 oz cup by which coffee is still measured in spite of the fact that we now live in a world where 16 oz cups are considered small.) What I got back out was a brew that would make church coffee laugh derisively. So then I just threw two bags into a cup and added 12 oz of hot water, and let them steep until the brew looked darker, and that actually worked pretty well.  With due respect to the gentleman who said ""teabagging"" with these things doesn't work, I have to disagree.  It makes a decent enough cup.  The coffee isn't strong, but it is smooth, and has has the classic African warmth and brightness.In all fairness, the truest test of this coffee would be to use it in a pod-style coffee maker, but absent that, you can actually make a decent cup without much work.  Just remember that it's 1 pod to each 6 oz of water, no matter what the instructions say.Which brings me to a gripe.  Where the heck are people finding instructions?  There are none on the box, none on the individual packets.  The only instruction I found was on the pod itself.  One side says: ""This side down""  Seriously, even if your product is for a machine, it's a good idea to be clear about how to use the product in that machine.All in all, Marley Coffee got points for flavor but lost them for unnecessarily vague packaging and the fact that it's kind of pricey.

It's easy to make, and has generally healthy ingredients.A container provides about 2 1/2 ounces of food. The base component is oatmeal, and they add in almonds, pistachios, and cherries. Note that this means the flavor will be a bit sour, from the cherries. Some people are OK with this. Others won't enjoy it. So this is definitely something you should try first before you buy a twelve pack of it. It might be perfect for you - or the flavor might not be one you enjoy.We did like the flavor, and we liked the fresh ingredients. But, that being said, the price on Amazon is over $2 a serving, which is fairly expensive. ""Regular"" oatmeal can be 50 cents a packet or even less. You could easily customize that oatmeal to be exactly the way you want.But of course, many people are so pressed for time that they only have coffee for breakfast. That is REALLY unhealthy. Many studies show that you should start the day with a meal of some sort, to give your body the nutrients it needs to metabolize properly until lunch. So if you're currently eating nothing at all, and a better breakfast just isn't possible with your schedule, then at least this instant-eat meal is a better solution.Nutrition wise, again this isn't great but it's certainly better than what many people eat (or don't eat) for breakfast. 290 calories, 8g fat, 180mg sodium, and a whopping 49g of carbs. Sure, 5g of that is fiber, but a large 19g of that is sugar. That's a lot of sugar to be pouring into your mouth the first thing in the day. You also get 9g protein. In terms of vitamins, you barely get anything.So overall I'd always suggest eating something HEALTHY for breakfast. Something with protein, nutrition, and what your body actually needs to get its muscles and blood working properly. Something with vitamin and minerals. So I do consider this a step up from many options - but I also consider it a stepping stone to help you get to a place where you eat a fresh meal, vs a sweetened, processed option.I was provided a review set of this from the Amazon Vine program.

She hopped up and poured one for me and before I could say ""Thanks,"" she added a big splash of vanilla creamer. Ouch!

From the full nutrition label, Switch lives up to that claim.  The ingredients are juice caoncentrates and added vitamin C.  No added sugar.  Just like juice, you get fruit sugar and fruit nutrients, but none of the fiber.  That's to be expected from a juice, although it seems some other reviewers were alarmed to discover that fruit is sweet due to sugar rather than naturally growing aspartame or sucrose.  Healthwise, this seems fine to me.As to taste:  I was expecting ""Black Cherry"" in a dark red can to be strong.  This was mellow.  I could taste the cherry juice, but I think apple was the dominant flavor.  This tasted remarkably like a children's juice box or a capri sun baggie, probably because it's a mix of juices in which apple is prominent.  It tasted like real juice - not fake.The carbonation was light, and added a bit of texture.  At home, purchasing fruit juice in a bottle and seltzer water in a bottle and mixing them in a glass provides more options and a taste of carbonated fruit juice.  I used to do lots of carbonated fruit juice mixes, and think I prefer plain apple juice and seltzer water to this, mostly because the Switch flavor didn't strike me.  Which juice sits best with you will be a matter of taste, and if you like carbonated fruit juice, then this could be a way to make it portable for bag lunches, road trips, and such.Overall, if you drink a lot of sodas and like fruit juice, this is worth a try, perhaps in the form of one can on a road trip.

I eat some in my morning Oatmeal, and I always make it a point to get the Diet Coke with Splenda in it, rather than the aspartame stuff.I have been getting the fiber splenda.  One gram of fiber per packet didn't seem to be much, but it was something to make the sweetener less empty, and it eliminated the gram of dextrose used to stretch the Splenda to make it measure. You occasionally see the tablets of Splenda, but they are rare, and they don't work on oatmeal.So I asked my wife, ""Please surprise me by switching to the Splenda Essentials with Antioxidants some morning over the next week.""  She agreed. On the third morning, I noted an odd taste in my cereal.  Not unpleasant, just odd.I asked her, and she confirmed, that was the first morning she had used the Antioxidant Splenda.So, unlike the fiber splenda, the antioxidant Splenda has a taste.Now, I normally only put sweetener in my coffee if it is nasty tasting.  But I don't have any nasty tasting coffee, so I put the antioxidant Splenda sweetener into regular coffee just to see if I can taste it.I am pretty sure I can taste it, but it is not a blind taste test.  I am going by what I taste in my oatmeal.As I've said, the taste is minor and not unpleasant.  It is hard to detect when I put one packet into 8 ounces of coffee.My opinion is that Splenda is the best artificial sweetener on the market.  The worst tasting is aspartame, then stevia because of the odd licorice overtone. Then saccharine, and that only when a small amount of saccarine is used.  I used to make ice tea with a half gallon of strong tea and one saccharine, and at that ratio, it was not bad.  It took the bitter edge off of the tea.If you can get cyclamates, they go here, and then, at the top, Splenda. Nothing tastes like sugar, especially not corn syrup, but splenda has the most neutral sweet taste of the artificials.  Now that it is available, I try not to use any of the other artificials, and I am not supposed to consume a lot of sugar.So plain splenda would get five stars as an artificial sweetener.  Essentials with fiber would get the same score. Antioxidant gets 4 stars because it has an off taste that is not a bad taste and because it is detectable other than sweetener. I believe that even with this off taste it tastes better than saccharine.  So it loses one star for the detectable taste, but not more.This sweetener comes in a heavy, stiff, hard to tear bag, that could probably survive being kept in a wallet in the rain without damage, and the bag is stiff and strong enough that someone with bad arthritis might not want or be able to use the sweetener in the bag.

I followed the instructions on the package - 1 rounded tablespoon for each 6 ounce cup of coffee. I found the same taste results with both methods. I like a good cup of black coffee but am not fanatical about it. I do grind fresh bold or medium body beans each morning and use filtered water to prepare the pot.As someone who usually adds a little espresso or instant espresso powder to most chocolate recipes I know this flavor combination is a wonderful marriage. Depending on the percentage of espresso to chocolate, the result is either a deep mocha flavor with the coffee playing a major role, or a small addition will result in complex chocolate flavor with no obvious coffee component.  Unfortunately, with the Gevalia Dark Chocolate Truffle coffee the merger of coffee and chocolate adversely affected both the coffee and the chocolate flavor.There is a definite aftertaste from the artificial flavor, and the coffee itself is bitter and acidic. I do not know if the artificial flavor affected the coffee or the coffee is bitter and acidic on its own but, after each sip I had an involuntary puckering reaction, not my lips, but the inside of my cheeks as if I was consuming something containing acetic acid, like vinegar, not that it tasted like vinegar - it didn't.  The flavor was remarkably unpleasant, and when the cup cooled off, it tasted worse. Even the aroma while brewing smelled artificial.The other reviewers who mention how greatly improved the flavor became once cream was added is an indication of a consistent problem.  I love the taste of coffee and like it unadorned - no cream or sugar. I only add cream if I am in a restaurant and the coffee doesn't taste good. I use the cream to doctor-it-up in hopes of salvaging some of the flavor and masking the poor aspects whether caused by bitterness or coffee that's been sitting in the pot too long.  This coffee is no exception, the cream vastly improved the drinkability, but the action is akin to smearing butter on a day old roll. Underneath it is still a stale roll, and although the butter tastes delicious, it would not be accurate to call the combination a buttery delight.On the positive side, flavored coffees are usually light body and the Gevalia is definitely medium body. The packaging is quite attractive and the name is clever, but in the end may work against the product because Dark Chocolate Truffle evokes a clear taste profile for most people and the coffee doesn't live up to the name. I am rating the coffee three stars instead of less because if the purchaser always uses cream in their coffee, many of the taste issues I encountered should be if not resolved, at least mitigated.

It was honestly hard for me to pick out separate flavors, such was the harmonious balance. If I had to guess what spices were in it, that would be hard to do. Wonderful blend. They are listed on the box as: Chili, galangal, onion, shallot, pandan leaf, garlic, candlenut, ginger, lemon grass, fennel, coriander, cumin, kaffir lime leaf, cloves, turmeric, white pepper, cinnamon. I think they forgot to add ""crack"" into their list, I'm already jonesing for another bowl of this.CONS*The bits of leaves in the sauce kept interfering with my enjoyment of the dish. I know they are important to impart that fresh bright taste, but I felt like I was chewing my cud. It was like having bits of lawn clippings in my food and was annoying. I think this could be offset by using more veggies than I did.*The coconut powder can be lumpy and grainy, see tips belowCOOKING TIPS*The sauce thickens quickly and wants to stick to bottom of pan, I'd cook the meat to ALMOST done and then combine with the sauce.*Mix the coconut powder and water together, and then whisk in the paste.

Yes, it's that this isn't the most cost-effective way to buy water and/or any caffeinated beverage, but it's no worse than most of the others here.For me the 90mg caffeine is just right for a quick pick-me-up, but for those who want half the kick, there'savitae 45 Mg Caffeinated Water, the 'low-octane' version with about as much caffeine as a diet soda... but again: no carbonation, no sugar, no calories, no artificial sweeteners, and no additives.To summarize this, there are plenty of ways that you can get your caffeine boost listed here if you take a moment to search for them. I've been a bit harsh on some of them, but this one is a winner, and if you want just that pure clean taste of water but with a little jolt, avitae's caffeinated water is hard to beat.6/27/2012 ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2009, 2023)",1,0.0,False

It is not important if the oil or the tablet is even frozen at the time of production till you consume since any seed, and I mean any type of seed regardless of the brand will go rancid once ground and cracked open since the shell, the protection is removed which will allow air and moisture access the oil of the seed much quicker than when the seed is in a complete un-hulled form. The best example of rancidity is brown rice. Place some brown rice in freezer and you will notice in few months it will not even cook since the oils have gone rancid even if it was kept in a sealed container in the freezer regardless. Chia is the only seed that does not need to be ground in order for human body to digest and get the nutrients and can be stored for longer time than any other seed without going rancid. Sesame seed, flax seed, etc. are so dense that will pass through human body when not ground making it absolutely worthless since human body can not digest it in its natural form.FIBER: Fiber is essential for body since fiber absorbs the unwanted liquid in the gut and body has to defecate that blown up fiber which in return lowers cholesterol, glucose, blood pressure, etc. and brings comfort and efficiency to human body unlike fat which stays in human body unless needed for energy.

I consume lots of seeds, beans, grains, vegetables, etc. and freshness is a priority regardless of the brand so I always purchase my food ingredients in small quantities from reputable sellers with high turnover. When fresh, food is nutritious and that goes for any food in any form, from frozen to canned. Fresh food is nutritious as well as delicious since nutrients give food its delicious taste. When old or rancid, nutrients are gone and any food item becomes an empty calories with no taste and absolutely worthless regardless of the brand or price, organic or conventional. For few years I consumed seeds in oil form since physicians advised me to do so not knowing that majority are not aware that seeds hardly offer any nutrients unless; seeds are fresh, not old which means rancid, not in oil form, not in supplement form, not hulled, ground and consumed within few days, kept in dark cold temperatures, away from light-sun-moisture since the oil in seeds and nuts go rancid regardless. That is why brown rice which has its nutrients will go rancid even if kept in freezer while white rice will last for years at room temperature since it hardly has any nutrients or oil. I ground in my coffee grinder sesame, flax, chia, amaranth, hemp then add cocoa, isolate protein, soy milk and consume it before my workouts on daily basis for its vitamins, minerals, protein and many nutrients, without much spike in my glucose. Un-hulled seeds are full of nutrients. I never consume hulled seeds which are empty calories, absolutely worthless since the nutrients have been removed.OMEGA-3: You will never see ALA on any fish you purchase. Infact you will never see ALA on any fish oil supplement either, you will only see EPA and DHA. ALA is not the same as EPA or DHA. That is true for any brand of flaxseed regardless if such flaxseed oil is in solid form, oil form in a bottle or in a capsule form. Greens, veges, nuts, seeds and fruits do not offer any Omega-3 in form of EPA/DHA since omega-3 EPA/DHA is an animal source. There are two major types of omega-3 fatty acids in our diets: One type is alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which is found in plants the other type, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is found in fatty fish. The body partially converts ALA to EPA and DHA. There is no proof what percent of ALA gets converted by human body to EPA or DHA. You can consume all ALAs that you want and depending to your genes it may never turn any into omega-3. Blood test is the only way to see the affects. I get omega 3 from sardines although flaxseed is an important part of my diet since flaxseed offers so many nutrients.

While I know it's not politically correct, as I stated in my in other reviews of K cups and the machine itself, this is one of my few bad habits, so deal with it.Now that Keurig's patent has expired, everybody is jumping on the ""K cup bandwagon."" Many of these new entries are priced considerably lower per K cup than those that use ""Official K Cups"" licensed from Keurig. So how do you tell if any of these roasters make a blend worth drinking? Sample packs of course! It's the perfect way to try blends from a roaster you may not have heard of. With that in mind I was pleased to find this sample pack from Brooklyn Beans. Having two or three samples of several blends makes it fun to compare and contrast Brooklyn Beans with those from other firms, especially the standardbearer, Green Mountain Coffee Roasters.The MethodI prefer ""fuller flavored"" coffees while Mrs. Boilermate will drink just about anything. To evaluate these blends both Mrs. Boilermate and I sampled each blend. I drink my coffee with half and half and sugar while she drinks hers black. Even with these differences we generally agreed on the final result. This is how we evaluated this sample pack: The B145 allows you to make a six, eight, or ten ounce cup. If there were three samples of a blend other than ""extra bold,"" I made a 12 ounce cup using 2K cups and 6 ounces of water each, and Mrs. Boilermate made a cup with one K cup and 8 ounces. If there were only two samples of a blend we both made them with 8 ounces of water. The only exception was for blends marked ""extra bold."" These were all made with one K cup and 10 ounces of water. All flavored coffees were made with one K cup and eight ounces of water.So, how do the Brooklyn Beans blend stack up? Well, not surprisingly, we both brought some were very good, some are were average, and others we wouldn't drink again if someone stuck hot needles under our fingernails.The CupsThese cups (the container, not the coffee) are as good as any K cups out there. They mimic the style of Keurig's K Cup, and this is not a bad thing, as each capsule keeps the coffee fresh until you brew it. None of the cups in my sample pack were crushed, split, or damaged in any way. They fit my machine perfectly, pierced cleanly, and worked as designed.AromaWhile the coffee was brewing, most blends had little discernible aroma. The only notable differences here were the Breakfast Blend and the Breakfast Blend Decaf. Both of these filled the room with delicious coffee aroma while the coffee was brewing. In the cup, the aroma was pretty good for most blends. A notable exception here was the Corner Donut Shop Blend, which smelled burnt.TasteFrom a taste standpoint, there were more hits than misses. Surprisingly, we both rated the Colombian blend only ""Okay."" Normally, this is a blend most roasters seem to be able to do quite well. The most liked blends were Fuhgeddaboutit, Breakfast, and Breakfast Decaf. The biggest miss was the Corner Donut Shop Blend that not only tasted weak but smelled burnt, as previously noted, and also tasted burnt. While Cyclone is billed as ""extra bold"" neither of us thought it was particularly bold. My notes said, ""A bit weak for a dark, extra bold roast. Three out of five stars."" Mrs. Boilermate said, ""Okay, but not worth paying a premium for.""I'm not generally disposed to flavored coffees, but these flavored roasts were pretty good. Mrs. Boilermate thought so too with the exception of Cinnamon Subway, to which she commented, ""Cinnamon doesn't go with coffee."" OTOH, I thought it was a good combination.  I was skeptical about what maple in coffee would be like, but I thought the Maple Sleigh was a really good blend. It was my favorite of all the flavored coffees.SourcingThere is nothing on the package or on Brooklyn Beans' website that indicates where they source their beans from. Given a choice, we prefer to buy our coffee from roasters whose beans are sourced from certified Fair Trade (or similar organizations) suppliers, and we are willing to pay extra for it. Roasters who use such beans normally highlight this as a selling point. Since there is no such mention by Brooklyn Beans I would assume they are not.Bottom LineBased solely on price and taste, Brooklyn Beans blends compete favorably with other brands of K cups. Fuhgeddaboutit and Breakfast Blend compared very favorably to our current favorites, GMCR's Dark Magic and Colombian respectively. With a few exceptions, the sample pack was well-liked in our household. At the time of this writing they cost about $.55 apiece, which is about the same as we pay for Green Mountain K cups, but finding competitively priced single blend packs in the varieties we like is a bit more challenging.Given the choice between roasters who use certified Fair Trade or similarly certified beans and those who don't, we will normally choose those that do. Having said that, some of Brooklyn Beans' blends will make it into our rotation. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(5004, 5018)",2,0.0,False

From a health standpoint, the ingredient list IS much more natural that most similar food products--everything on the list is pronouncable and understandable. The box claims that there are 19g or more per serving of whole grains in these crackers and lists the serving size as 8 crackers or 2 full cracker sheets. Following is per-serving nutritional information for those who care:Calories: 110Total Fat: 2.5gMonounsat: 1.5g (the other gram of fat is not accounted for that I could see)Sodium: 130mgPotassium: 85mgTotal Carbs: 22gDietary Fiber: 2gSugars: 8gProtein: 2gWhen compared with Nabisco Honey Maid Lowfat Cinnamon Grahams, these crackers have less calories, sugar and sodium than the Honey Maid Grahams. Honey Maid also uses HFCS (high fructose corn syrup) and partially-hydrogenated oils which these do not. These crackers are sweetened using sugar, honey, evaporated cane juice and brown rice syrup, apple juice concentrate and raisin paste whereas Honey Maid uses honey, molasses, HFCS and dextrose.TASTE AND TEXTURE:TEXTURE: I found these crackers much more delicate than a standard graham cracker. There was a moderate to substantial amount of breakage from the shipping process. I found the dividing line for each cracker (within a sheet) much less discernable than a standard brand of graham crackers. I also found these crackers really dry--moreso than a regular brand. I'm assuming both of these things are because Back to Nature is trying to make a healthier cracker, but that's just my guess.TASTE: This is being sold as an Apple Cinnamon flavored graham cracker. For me, there was far too little graham flavor in these crackers and the cinnamon flavor was very lacking as well. The taste reminded me of a cross between bran muffins with raisins and bran muffins with dehydrated apples. There seemed to be some taste difference between the various sleeves of crackers.SUMMARY:If finding a healthier graham cracker is your primary concern, these may be your best bet. For me, flavor and texture concerns do not make the increased healthiness worth it for me.

The flakes are VERY hard, though...some might call it ""crunchy,"" but to me, it was unusual to have a flake that was resistant to being chewed!  This took a little getting used to...but at least the flake is tasty.There are also little bits of barley in the cereal, and this adds a nice psychological touch.

It is not important if the oil or the tablet is even frozen at the time of production till you consume since any seed, and I mean any type of seed regardless of the brand will go rancid once ground and cracked open since the shell, the protection is removed which will allow air and moisture access the oil of the seed much quicker than when the seed is in a complete un-hulled form. The best example of rancidity is brown rice. Place some brown rice in freezer and you will notice in few months it will not even cook since the oils have gone rancid even if it was kept in a sealed container in the freezer regardless. Chia is the only seed that does not need to be ground in order for human body to digest and get the nutrients and can be stored for longer time than any other seed without going rancid. Sesame seed, flax seed, etc. are so dense that will pass through human body when not ground making it absolutely worthless since human body can not digest it in its natural form.FIBER: Fiber is essential for body since fiber absorbs the unwanted liquid in the gut and body has to defecate that blown up fiber which in return lowers cholesterol, glucose, blood pressure, etc. and brings comfort and efficiency to human body unlike fat which stays in human body unless needed for energy. Flax is high in fiber.MINERALS: Flax is one of the kings of nutrients when it comes to minerals and so important to me as a whole delicious seed; highest ALA, high magnesium, high potassium, calcium with the healthiest fat.Accordingly for 100gr servings size of;SESAME__FLAX__CHIA__AMARANTH__QUINOA__HEMP__PISTACHIO__ALMOND__CASHEW__PEANUTCALORIES565__534__490__371__368__567__557__575__553__585SAT FAT34__18__16__7__4__17__27__19__39__34CALCIUM99__26__63__16__5__0__11__26__4__5MAGNESIUM89__98__0__62__49__167__30__67__73__44POTASSIUM14__23__5__15__16__167__29__20__19__19ZINC48__29__23__19__21__83__15__21__39__22FIBER47__109__151__8__11__4 __41__49__13__32PHYTOSTEROLS714__0__0__0__0__N/A__214__0__0__0FRESHNESS: Fresh means nutritious and delicious. I consume lots of seeds, beans, grains, vegetables, etc. and freshness is a priority regardless of the brand so I always purchase my food ingredients in small quantities from reputable sellers with high turnover. When fresh, food is nutritious and that goes for any food in any form, from frozen to canned. Fresh food is nutritious as well as delicious since nutrients give food its delicious taste. When old or rancid, nutrients are gone and any food item becomes an empty calories with no taste and absolutely worthless regardless of the brand or price, organic or conventional. For few years I consumed seeds in oil form since physicians advised me to do so not knowing that majority are not aware that seeds hardly offer any nutrients unless; seeds are fresh, not old which means rancid, not in oil form, not in supplement form, not hulled, ground and consumed within few days, kept in dark cold temperatures, away from light-sun-moisture since the oil in seeds and nuts go rancid regardless. That is why brown rice which has its nutrients will go rancid even if kept in freezer while white rice will last for years at room temperature since it hardly has any nutrients or oil. I ground in my coffee grinder sesame, flax, chia, amaranth, hemp then add cocoa, isolate protein, soy milk and consume it before my workouts on daily basis for its vitamins, minerals, protein and many nutrients, without much spike in my glucose. Un-hulled seeds are full of nutrients. I never consume hulled seeds which are empty calories, absolutely worthless since the nutrients have been removed.OMEGA-3: You will never see ALA on any fish you purchase. Infact you will never see ALA on any fish oil supplement either, you will only see EPA and DHA. ALA is not the same as EPA or DHA. That is true for any brand of flaxseed regardless if such flaxseed oil is in solid form, oil form in a bottle or in a capsule form. Greens, veges, nuts, seeds and fruits do not offer any Omega-3 in form of EPA/DHA since omega-3 EPA/DHA is an animal source. There are two major types of omega-3 fatty acids in our diets: One type is alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which is found in plants the other type, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is found in fatty fish. The body partially converts ALA to EPA and DHA. There is no proof what percent of ALA gets converted by human body to EPA or DHA. You can consume all ALAs that you want and depending to your genes it may never turn any into omega-3. Blood test is the only way to see the affects. I get omega 3 from sardines although flaxseed is an important part of my diet since flaxseed offers so many nutrients.

(The cookies, not the testers!  :-) )  They are about two inches across, maybe an eight of an inch thick, and are a darker brown than shown on the package.  Inside the cookie is a thin layer of fudge. The cookies have a bit of a dampish-texture and were all stuck together.The taste of the ""outside"" part of the cookie was slighly similar to soft-baked chocolate chip cookies.  However, the texture was a bit ""grainy"", somewhat like an soft oatmeal cookie.  The fudge layer on the inside was tasty, but was a little overpowered by the rest of the cookie.  It wasn't quite as firm as the layer you'd find in an oreo cookie, and was more like a spread.I love chocolate chip cookies, and I love fudge, so I had high hopes for these.  My wife has similar tastes and also thought they'd be a good cookie to try.  However, the testers and I unanimously agree that they are somewhat mediocre in taste and appearance.  While they aren't terrible by any means, they didn't grab me enough to make me want to go out and get more.  Everyone's taste is different, though, so you may love them.  I give these cookies a three star rating ... that is to say they're not good, they're not bad, they're only fair.As an aside, I received these cookies to evaluate as part of the Amazon Vine program.  The Amazon shipping container was very well protected and undamaged, but when I opened the pack of cookies, about a third of them had been reduced to crumbs, and only two thirds of them were in a condition to eat.  (And those were all stuck together.)  I don't know if that was due to rough handling or excessive heat during shipment, so I didn't consider it as part of my rating.

In our home corner of the desert Southwest, quite near the world-famous chili pepper fields of Hatch, New Mexico, chilis make up a major part of the local culinary scene. The Chili Pepper Institute at New Mexico State University, just up the road in Las Cruces, cultivates ever-hotter varieties of chili peppers from around the world. One of their latest finds is the Bhut Jolokia, which is many times hotter than the jalape&ntilde;o. In fact, we don't even buy jalape&ntilde;os any more--they're far too mild. Instead, we always have hotter serranos on hand to sprinkle on just about every meal, as well as our annual 30 pounds of roasted Hatch hot green chilis. We also always have a few bottles of hot pepper sauce in the pantry. Currently three bottles of Tabasco are in there--regular, garlic and haba&ntilde;ero. Thus, as a certified chili pepper fanatic, I leaped at the chance to try Gringo Bandito hot sauce when it showed up as a Vine selection.I've never been that impressed with hot sauces other than Tabasco. I prefer the clean, simple formulation of the classic products from Avery Island, Louisiana. Many of the other hot sauces we've tried in the past have had long lists of ingredients, which just dilute the pure chili pepper goodness. Gringo Bandito hot sauce is a happy medium. It has more ingredients than regular Tabasco, but not as many as some other brands--or, indeed, as the haba&ntilde;ero Tabasco, which has everything in it but the kitchen sink. Gringo Bandito's extra ingredients are all good. Near the top of the ingredient list are ""haba&ntilde;ero peppers, jalape&ntilde;o peppers, red Japanese chili peppers, more peppers...""So how does it taste? Well, taste is of course highly subjective, so if I say, ""It tastes great,"" that doesn't really mean anything. What's great to me may be horrible to someone else. Right up front, Gringo Bandito has the characteristic, distinctive, unmistakable haba&ntilde;ero taste. And it IS very hot. A few dollops added excellent flavor and spiciness to black-eyed-pea soup and Polish hunter's stew. In a side-by-side taste test with haba&ntilde;ero Tabasco, some differences stood out. Gringo Bandito is less hot than Tabasco, and it has a more one-dimensional flavor profile. In the comparison, it seems a little ""bland"" (as much as that can apply to a haba&ntilde;ero pepper sauce).But I don't mean that as a complaint. In fact, based on how it transformed the dishes we tested it in, Gringo Bandito is a tasty hot pepper sauce that will find a permanent place in our pantry, right next to the Tabascos.

I took one of these to eat while on a hike with a friend.  I enjoyed all the components to some degree.  The sunbutter sunflower seed spread is good, tastes very close to peanut butter.  I thought there was plenty to spread around on the crackers, which had a nice light taste and satisfying crispy texture.  The cookie is satisfactory for what it is, not too sweet, but very thin, dry and crumbly; mine was pretty much a pile of cookie pieces.  The seed and fruit trail mix is great!  I like the tropical fruit strip well enough to eat it, but it was probably my least favorite component.Total calories as listed on the outside of the box is 490, with 52 carbs, 27 grams of fat (6 g saturated), and 9 grams of fiber.  You'll also get 20% of your daily iron needs and 10% vitamin C.  Total weight is 3.6 ounces, so this is a fairly calorically dense meal for the amount of food you're actually eating.  I don't know how long this would last if eaten during an active day (I ate again within three hours of eating my GoPicnic, so it lasted that long for me), so it might be more appropriate as a snack when hiking, biking, or any other high energy activity when one is travelling and/or out and about and not near home or other food source.As for the nutritional breakdown of the individual components, only the sunbutter, fruit strip, and crackers have an individual nutritional label on their specific package.  The cookie and trail mix are both Enjoy Life products, and their respective packages, while not having specific information, indicated that nutritional information could be found on Enjoy Life Foods' website.  The ingredients of all components are provided on the outside of the GoPicnic box, so you don't have to tear the box open for that information.The crackers have 60 calories, the sunbutter has 200, and the fruit strip has 70.  If the total calories equals 490, then subtracting the calories for these three items, that leaves 160 calories between the cookie and the trail mix.  I would guess the trail mix has more calories than the cookie, but I haven't bothered to look these up on Enjoy Life's website.Overall I like this lunchbox-type meal.  It's got a pretty good mix of carbs, fat and protein, and I enjoyed the taste of everything.  I'm intrigued enough to try some of the other GoPicnic ready-to-eat meals.

It's probably been about 25 years since I've had that particular pleasure, so when the opportunity arose to try these 'fancy' graham crackers I took advantage.Nabisco grahams are practically coated in a layer of cinnamon and sugar, leaving a pleasant residue on your fingers. In contrast these Back to Nature crackers have no visible spice on the surface though they do have a smattering of whole grains on the surface, ostensibly to give it that ""old world wholesome"" appearance. Although there's no spice on the surface the scent of apples and cinnamon is pleasant and clean.Oddly, although the smell of apples and cinnamon is quite strong out of the box, the apple cinnamon flavor is comparatively weak. That's not to say the flavor is too weak, only that it's weaker than I thought it would be based on how nice they smell.From a texture perspective these grahams are lighter and airier than Nabisco's offerings. Whereas a Nabisco graham has a bite sort of like the chocolate part of an Oreo cookie, these grahams have a softer and crisper bite more like a Ritz cracker. As such they tend to crumble more easily and, when dunked in milk, they tend to fall apart very quickly.So overall these are a pleasant tasting, light, reasonably wholesome treat that would go great with tea and maybe a little apple jam. I don't know that they'd ever be as much of a childhood favorite as the ol' Nabiscos, but I can see them being a more ""evolved"" graham for more grown-up tastes.

My mother runs the supplements department of a huge health food store.  I have tasted dozens of health food bars.  Most I wouldn't even consider health food because they are filled with highly-processed extracts of whole foods, such as soy protein (which most people are allergic to).  Even organic food bars are filled with unwholesome ingredients that I would never put into my body.  So I am alway eager to try an organic food bar with an ingredient list short enough to memorize.INGREDIENTSIn a single word - EXCEPTIONAL.  In the market of food bars, this bar is at the top (alongside a few others which I will list below).  Minimal ingredients, all organic, no added sugar, no added thickening agents.  Just nuts and fruits, with a little bit of added organic oil.  Great!  5 stars all the way!TASTEWhen it comes to food, taste is often the deciding factor  (when it really should be ingredients because our taste buds will change very quickly once we stop ingesting super sugary or super salty foods).  Unfortunately most people will rank this bar as mediocre in the taste department. Most people eat far too much sugar and salt in their diet, so any natural foods will taste bland and uninteresting.  For me, however, my taste buds enjoyed the balanced flavor of almond, cashew, blueberry, and date in this bar.  I give it 4 stars for flavor.  It is good, but falls just short of delicious.So there you have it.. a healthy alternative to other food bars out there.  A good natural flavor that is not too sweet.  When you just can't take a cooked me with you to work or on the road, this food bar is a good choice.Overall, I give this bar 5 stars.  5 for ingredients, 4 for flavor, and that extra 1/2 point because making great tasting organic food bars with clean ingredients is so darn difficult.OTHER RECOMMENDATIONSLike I said, I have much experience in the health food world and I love passing on good information when I have it.  So here are my other recommendations for organic food bars.  I purposefully did not include most of the well-known food bars - they are so filled with processed ingredients, indigestible filler ingredients, and sugar that I would never put them in my body.1) Raw Organic Food Bar.  Yup, that's the actual brand name.  They make great bars with ingredients very similar to this bar.  The difference is Raw Organic Food Bars are more oily and sweet.  These are my personal favorites.  They have many flavors, so try a few to find your favorites.  Raw Organic Food Bar, Chocolate Coconut, 1.76-Ounce Bars(Pack of 12), Raw Organic Food Bar, Chocolatey Chocolate Chip, 1.76-Ounce Bars(Pack of 12), Raw Organic Food Bar, Fiber Chocolate Delite, 1.76-Ounce Bars(Pack of 12), Raw Organic Food Bar, Cinnamon Raisin, 1.76-Ounce Bars(Pack of 12)2) Raw Revolution Organic Live Food Bars.  These bars only contain only 3-5 ingredients per bar and everything is raw.  These bars are good as well - more flavor than the Pure Bar, but too sweet or chocolaty sometimes.Raw Revolution Organic Live Food Bars, Spirulina and Cashew, 2.2-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12),Raw Revolution Organic Live Food Bars, Coconut and Chocolate, 2.2-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12),Raw Revolution Organic Live Food Bars, Raspberry and Chocolate, 2.2-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12).3) Greens Plus Organic Food Bars.  This company offer a variety of bars with different ingredients.  Some bars use peanut butter others use cashews.  Some bars use whey protein, others use soy.  So be sure to read the ingredient before you indulge.  This company uses more processed whole food extracts (like the protein powders), but still the company is on the right track.

They have slightly less sugar (7 g vs 8-10 for other brands), significantly less sodium (130 g vs 200 and up), slightly more fiber, slightly fewer calories (about 15 cal fewer per serving).

The taste definitely tastes fruity, but I could not detect a blueberry flavor at all.

My family liked it better when cooked a little longer (not al dente but not mushy either) but they weren't enthused about it.My sister in law buys this pasta regularly and often comments how her kids don't crave as many sweets during the day as they normally do, so she has all kinds of shapes of Barilla Plus.I might try other shapes maybe thin spaghetti and see if my family likes it better.

What an absolute joke, in US they continuously talk about health care but yet this one creation of nature which offers so much not only is not produced in US but yet the only site that I trust for ingredients which is the USDA Nutritional Value, will not offer me any info in regard to this superfood. Now you probably get an idea why so many industries controlling your dear representatives in US Senate will not allow hemp to have a chance to flourish in US. Big Pharma loves that idea since they sell those magnesium supplements which god knows what is in those unregulated tablets but yet citizens of US will not have access to the simple knowledge of all the minerals, vitamins, proteins and multitude of healthy hidden ingredients that this superfood offers at a reasonable price but yet they have all the nutritional value of Chia seeds which hardly has any vitamin or mineral but yet a whopping fiber at a whopping price since it is no threat to any industry in US... shame, shame, shame. While hemp and marijuana are kissing cousins, the amount of THC in hemp is almost non existent. Two tablespoons contains 400 milligrams of anti-inflammatory gamma-linolenic acid and 2 grams of omega-3 fats, plus all nine essential amino acids, compounds that help maximize recovery from workouts. I consume these straight from the container with spoon, an hour before my work outs without mixing in a bowl or as dressing. I consume it first thing in the morning or when I need a quick burst of energy regardless of the time of the day. For years I have consumed 1)raw sunflower seeds, 2)almonds in water 3)organic sesame+flax seeds ground in coffee maker+cocoa powder+unflavoured protein isolate, 4)hemp seeds, 5)watermelon & garlic on daily basis. Seeds all go rancid due to the oil and the germ of the seed so regardless of the type or brand, seeds need to be stored in freezer, in a dark, cold, sealed container, away from any moisture. If plastic container then it needs to be #5 or for me it is much safer in glass containers that keeps air out. I consume seeds within two weeks and insure not to purchase in big quantities since freshness is a priority to me due to the nutritional value which I consume food for, any food. Hemp is an unbelievable product and you can not grow it in US since it is illegal and big business does not want to see you healthy. No gain for big industries either since it is so cheap to grow with so many benefits that scares big pharma, plastic industry, fabric-cotton industry, pesticide producers, etc... so if you live in US, Canada becomes your only hope. Hemp increases my level of energy without any artificial stimulants like caffeine and sugar. More energy with less empty calorie fillers like sugar and saturated fat, in all energy bars which I never consume. Hemp contains the highest percentage of globulin than any other plant which is an essential amino acid that helps my body to create antibodies, a component of a healthy immune system. Healthy addition to a weight loss plan since it provides essential nutrients such as protein, essential fatty acids, fibre, vitamins and minerals without adding an excess amount of calories, starch, sugar or salt. One of the best natural boosters that I can get when doing any type of sport or when I need energy without a big meal. Hemp is truly a good plant for the environment and it is shame that we have to deal with the politics of the hemp instead of the benefits of the hemp in US. Victim of its own success. This is a super food next to quinoa, kale, broccoli, dandelion, raw honey, garlic, legumes, nuts, seeds, etc...MINERALS: Hemp is one of the kings of nutrients when it comes to minerals and so important to me as a whole delicious seed with highest magnesium, highest potassium, highest zinc and the healthiest fat......................SESAME...FLAX....CHIA....AMARANTH....QUINOA..HEMPCALORIES.......565.........534......490......371.............368.........567SAT FAT..........34...........18........16........7................4............17CALCIUM.........99...........26........63........16..............5.............0MAGNESIUM....89...........98.........0.........62..............49.............167POTASSIUM.....14...........23..........5..........15..............16.............167ZINC...............48...........29........23........19..............21..............83FRESHNESS: Fresh means nutritious and delicious. I consume lots of seeds, beans, grains, vegetables, etc. and freshness is a priority regardless of the brand so I always purchase my food ingredients in small quantities from reputable sellers with high turnover. When fresh, food is nutritious and that goes for any food in any form, from frozen to canned. Fresh food is nutritious as well as delicious since nutrients give food its delicious taste. When old or rancid, nutrients are gone and any food item becomes an empty calories with no taste and absolutely worthless regardless of the brand or price, organic or conventional. For few years I consumed seeds in oil form since physicians advised me to do so not knowing that majority are not aware that seeds hardly offer any nutrients unless; seeds are fresh, not old which means rancid, not in oil form, not in supplement form, not hulled, ground and consumed within few days, kept in dark cold temperatures, away from light-sun-moisture since the oil in seeds and nuts go rancid regardless. That is why brown rice which has its nutrients will go rancid even if kept in freezer while white rice will last for years at room temperature since it hardly has any nutrients or oil. I ground in my coffee grinder sesame, flax, chia, amaranth, hemp then add cocoa, isolate protein, soy milk and consume it before my workouts on daily basis for its vitamins, minerals, protein and many nutrients, without much spike in my glucose. Un-hulled seeds are full of nutrients. I never consume hulled seeds which are empty calories, absolutely worthless since the nutrients have been removed.FAT: The most important hormone, and the one that's crucial for weight loss, is insulin. Insulin is the hormone that controls fat storage. A high-carb diet increases the amount of glucose in the bloodstream, which in turn means you produce more insulin. The more insulin the body produces, the more fat gets stored. A low-carb diet means less insulin, making it easier to lose weight because less fat is then stored. For intake of a massive 5,000 calories every day for three weeks with calories from a low-fat, high-carb diet; and for another three weeks with calories from more fat no carbs with exactly the same amount of calories, with moderate exercise regimen each time; low-fat diet stacked on 16&#8201;lb with 3.7"" (9.5&#8201;cm) around the middle where the high fat diet offered a loss of 2.5 lb and loss of 1""(2.5&#8201;cm) from waistline. If calorie is calorie, then in my case and my experience shows that I would prefer to get my calories from a healthy fat from sesame seed and almond than the calories from the carbs in chia.

I was interested in trying Puerh because I had recently heard an interview about ""China's Dark Teas"" on The Splendid Table (google-able). I tried both the ginger and cardamom flavors.Traditional puerh comes in cakes or loose leaves, and is supposed to be ""rinsed"" for 10-20 seconds in hot water to remove impurities and start the tea opening.  Then steeped for about 30 seconds per cup (and the leaves can be re-steeped in more cups).  [Find out more about traditional puerh on the TeaSource page for puerh.]In contrast, the instructions on the package of teabags just say to steep for 3-5 minutes.  Does this tea have some sort of pre-processing that eliminates the traditional rinsing, or did they just used boiler plate instructions? -- the box doesn't say.  However, I didn't detect any major difference in the flavor of the rinsing water (15 seconds) and the cup of tea steeped for 3 minutes, so it doesn't seem that this tea needs the traditional pre-steeping.  The color was quite dark, but the flavor was much more mellow than some other plain black tea brewed to the same darkness.Of the two teas, the cardamom flavor was nice, but the ginger flavor was pretty minimal.  Without the spice, the 3-minute steeps would be too weak for my taste, lacking the fragrance and depth of, say, a good English Breakfast tea, but the cardamom rounded out the overall flavor.  So I would recommend getting the cardamom flavor rather than ginger.I steeped a second cup of each flavor after the first, for 2 minutes, and while the second cup of each was weaker, the spice flavor was a bit stronger in proportion, especially the ginger.  So to get relatively more spice flavor, you might need to steep for the full 5 minutes.  The second cup from the same teabag was sufficiently weaker that it doesn't seem like you could get many cups out of it, as described on the TeaSource page for traditional puerh tea.

It is not important if the oil or the tablet is even frozen at the time of production till you consume since any seed, and I mean any type of seed regardless of the brand will go rancid once ground and cracked open since the shell, the protection is removed which will allow air and moisture access the oil of the seed much quicker than when the seed is in a complete un-hulled form. The best example of rancidity is brown rice. Place some brown rice in freezer and you will notice in few months it will not even cook since the oils have gone rancid even if it was kept in a sealed container in the freezer regardless. Chia is the only seed that does not need to be ground in order for human body to digest and get the nutrients and can be stored for longer time than any other seed without going rancid. Sesame seed, flax seed, etc. are so dense that will pass through human body when not ground making it absolutely worthless since human body can not digest it in its natural form.FIBER: Fiber is essential for body since fiber absorbs the unwanted liquid in the gut and body has to defecate that blown up fiber which in return lowers cholesterol, glucose, blood pressure, etc. and brings comfort and efficiency to human body unlike fat which stays in human body unless needed for energy. Flax is high in fiber.MINERALS: Flax is one of the kings of nutrients when it comes to minerals and so important to me as a whole delicious seed; highest ALA, high magnesium, high potassium, calcium with the healthiest fat.Accordingly for 100gr servings size of;SESAME__FLAX__CHIA__AMARANTH__QUINOA__HEMP__PISTACHIO__ALMOND__CASHEW__PEANUTCALORIES565__534__490__371__368__567__557__575__553__585SAT FAT34__18__16__7__4__17__27__19__39__34CALCIUM99__26__63__16__5__0__11__26__4__5MAGNESIUM89__98__0__62__49__167__30__67__73__44POTASSIUM14__23__5__15__16__167__29__20__19__19ZINC48__29__23__19__21__83__15__21__39__22FIBER47__109__151__8__11__4 __41__49__13__32PHYTOSTEROLS714__0__0__0__0__N/A__214__0__0__0FRESHNESS: Fresh means nutritious and delicious. I consume lots of seeds, beans, grains, vegetables, etc. and freshness is a priority regardless of the brand so I always purchase my food ingredients in small quantities from reputable sellers with high turnover. When fresh, food is nutritious and that goes for any food in any form, from frozen to canned. Fresh food is nutritious as well as delicious since nutrients give food its delicious taste. When old or rancid, nutrients are gone and any food item becomes an empty calories with no taste and absolutely worthless regardless of the brand or price, organic or conventional. For few years I consumed seeds in oil form since physicians advised me to do so not knowing that majority are not aware that seeds hardly offer any nutrients unless; seeds are fresh, not old which means rancid, not in oil form, not in supplement form, not hulled, ground and consumed within few days, kept in dark cold temperatures, away from light-sun-moisture since the oil in seeds and nuts go rancid regardless. That is why brown rice which has its nutrients will go rancid even if kept in freezer while white rice will last for years at room temperature since it hardly has any nutrients or oil. I ground in my coffee grinder sesame, flax, chia, amaranth, hemp then add cocoa, isolate protein, soy milk and consume it before my workouts on daily basis for its vitamins, minerals, protein and many nutrients, without much spike in my glucose. Un-hulled seeds are full of nutrients. I never consume hulled seeds which are empty calories, absolutely worthless since the nutrients have been removed.OMEGA-3: You will never see ALA on any fish you purchase. Infact you will never see ALA on any fish oil supplement either, you will only see EPA and DHA. ALA is not the same as EPA or DHA. That is true for any brand of flaxseed regardless if such flaxseed oil is in solid form, oil form in a bottle or in a capsule form. Greens, veges, nuts, seeds and fruits do not offer any Omega-3 in form of EPA/DHA since omega-3 EPA/DHA is an animal source. There are two major types of omega-3 fatty acids in our diets: One type is alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which is found in plants the other type, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is found in fatty fish. The body partially converts ALA to EPA and DHA. There is no proof what percent of ALA gets converted by human body to EPA or DHA. You can consume all ALAs that you want and depending to your genes it may never turn any into omega-3. Blood test is the only way to see the affects. I get omega 3 from sardines although flaxseed is an important part of my diet since flaxseed offers so many nutrients.

This produced a strong coffee, but it was nasty!  The taste was like someone had dropped in an excessive amount of vanilla extract or sugar free vanilla flavoring.  Kind of like getting a vanilla latte in a tourist trap area.  The next pot, I backed off by reducing the grounds by two scoops and left the amount of water the same.  This produced a weaker but still good coffee taste with very mild hint of vanilla flavoring.  *Much better* in my opinion, and very palatable.  For the third pot, I went for iced coffee, cold brewing in a French press, using the original instructions. The product was very smooth and tasty.  Letting it sit in the fridge overnight after brewing enhanced the flavor.  Finally, I hot brewed it in the French press, again using the original mix ratio from the package.  Sadly, the taste again not so good, though not as bad as the first pot.In the end, I did find two brewing methods that I liked.  While I would have preferred a stronger vanilla flavor, I wasn't able to get it out of this product before I finished the package.

I converted all of them to the same number of grams per serving so my comparisons would be meaningful.  In nutritional value this cereal was close to Lucky Charms and Leaping Lemurs (an organic version of peanut butter Kix).  The Lucky Charms had more sugar and less fiber.  For a 50g serving of Back To Nature Summer Berry Blend Cereal you get 191 Calories; 1g Fat; 42g of Carbs with 15g of that in Sugar.  You also get 5g of Fiber but it doesn't state whether that fiber is soluble or insoluble.  Finally, there are 5g of Protein and 91g of Sodium.How does the cereal taste?  The flakes are very hard/crisp and very very sweet.  It made me think of eating a really hard frosted flake (with sugar added).  The fruit is freeze dried without any additional sugar so it is tart (but there is still sugar in the fruit, concentrated fructose).  I put soy milk on the cereal and let it sit for a minute and the flakes were still hard.  I tried rinsing some flakes in warm water to take some of the sweetness out, but that left warm, tasteless squishy flakes that were still sweet.If you like Very sweet cereal with a light malted barley taste, you'll like it.  Just remember that it full of sugar and the sugar/fiber ratio is not good.  If you are attracted to it because it says ""Natural"", remember that there are no regulations on the use of the word ""Natural"" in the food industry and the cereal does list any ingredients as organic.  I have to admit I did like the flavor and I liked the extreme crunch.  However, I threw away most of the box of cereal to keep from eating it because of the high sugar content.

Bigelow's ingredients are peppermint leaves, spearmint leaves, rose hips, lemon peel, hibiscus.

Yogi recommends 4-6 minutes). After seeping, looking at the 2 cups of tea, the Yogi tea is darker -you can tell that there is some black tea included. Both teas are aromatic - the Mint Medley has a nice soft mint smell. Yogi smells like mint, however, it has a more complex smell - there's a hint of cinnamon and it smells a bit sweeter than the Mint Medley. Taste-wise, both teas have a nice mint flavor, however, I found the Yogi tea just had more depth to it: as a tea drinker I can taste that there's black tea included in the blend. There's also a mild tingly sensation after drinking the tea (very very mild tingling).

It would have been better if it wasn't so sweet and maybe had some carbonation. As for its effectiveness as a energy boost I'll have to get back to you on that. If it gets me through the night shift then it will be one that I wouldn't mind using again and probably will if I can find it.After using this last night it did help me a lot. I had more energy through the night shift and didn't have that much of a drop when it was running down. The best part was that it gave me the energy boost that I needed without making my jitter around like a frog on a hot sidewalk. It was good enough that it could possibly become habit forming since I could really use another shot of it today to help get over the slight hangover feeling that I had this morning. But fortunately for me they are expensive enough that I cant indulge myself and end up using them on a daily basis. ANSWERNOTFOUND",the taste of it just a little,"(512, 541)",1,0.5,False

I have to say, my entire family was disappointed, for several reasons.  My kids did not like the card board taste or texture of the crackers.  They tasted stale and overly grainy and left a very dry taste in your mouth.  I did not like them because each cracker has 7 grams of fat and 220 mg of sodium per serving.  To me, that is too much fat and sodium for a snack I want to give my kids--especially since they are not ""full"" after eating them, and ask for another snack when they are done with the Crackerful.  Other than the fact that this Crackerful offers some whole grains in their ingredient list, they have the same nutritional value and caloric intake as the ""non-multigrain"" versions that Nabisco makes, and at least the other flavors, like the Four Cheese, taste much better than their whole grain counterpart.  We ended up throwing out the remaining packs that we did not sample, and I will not be buying the whole grain version again.

Bigelow's ingredients are peppermint leaves, spearmint leaves, rose hips, lemon peel, hibiscus. Yogi is organic peppermint leaf, organic Assam black tea leaf, organic spearmint leaf, organic cinnamon bark, organic ginger root, organic cardamom seed, green tea extract, organic black pepper, kola nut, guarana seed, organic clove bud, stevia leaf.I seeped both teas for the same amount of time - approximately 5 minutes (Bigelow recommends seeping for 3-5 minutes. Yogi recommends 4-6 minutes). After seeping, looking at the 2 cups of tea, the Yogi tea is darker -you can tell that there is some black tea included. Both teas are aromatic - the Mint Medley has a nice soft mint smell. Yogi smells like mint, however, it has a more complex smell - there's a hint of cinnamon and it smells a bit sweeter than the Mint Medley. Taste-wise, both teas have a nice mint flavor, however, I found the Yogi tea just had more depth to it: as a tea drinker I can taste that there's black tea included in the blend. There's also a mild tingly sensation after drinking the tea (very very mild tingling). Overall, I found the Yogi tea tasted better and I enjoyed it more.I don't know the accuracy of its claims to get your chi moving. However, this is a great tasting mint tea.

The ""meat"" sauce contains small traces of something that could be meat, but I'd need a microscope to be sure.  The sauce itself is a bit too bland to cover up the odd taste of the pasta itself (which said pasta stubbornly refuses to stay on the fork).  And even if you enjoy the meal, you'll only be able to do so for about five or six bites.  While the portion size may be the ""proper"" size for what people actually need, I don't think that most people, especially men, will find the portion size satisfying or hunger abating for long (although, to be fair, it's no smaller than most such single-serving microwave meals).Overall, I would have expected better from Barilla (which I swear by for most pasta needs), but if you're doing a working lunch and just need to get some quick sustenance, this will do as well as anything.

I prefer cream in my coffee, so I was hesitant to taste it as it was. But I tasted it and found it to have a nice medium coffee strength with a bit of sweetness to it. In my everyday coffee I don't add sugar, but on occasion it's nice to have a special coffee drink, and since it's been hot here lately, I had poured it over ice as well. I added cream and found it to be quite enjoyable. It's one of those conveniences that one could easily become addicted to.Next I tried the Cappuccino which had a similar taste and flavor as the Caffe, but was milder. I prefer my coffee stronger, so my preference was for the Caffe and still I would have liked it stronger (perhaps this is offered in another version). But the Cappuccino was also good and I had poured it over ice as well. I was concerned about both coffees being packaged in cans as I don't like my drinks to have a metallic tinge to them, but I did not notice anything out of the ordinary. I had, however, poured the drinks over ice into a glass, so that may have helped. Regardless, it was really nice to have sitting out on my deck on a warm day. Hot coffee just does not sit well with me in hot weather.All-in-all, if you're looking for a mild, sweet coffee drink that's quick and easy to take with you on the go or to pour into a glass at home, this is a good choice. It's small and convenient to slip into a purse or briefcase. While the coffee is mild, it still gives a quick pick-me-up in the morning, or in the middle of the day if need be.

It can take about 35 minutes to cook them from start to finish, with lots of stirring of the pot and keeping track of exactly how the heat is regulated on your stove.  I have made them the ""long"" way many times.  The taste is absolutely wonderful and the texture is quite pleasing.  I have also soaked the oats in water overnight and then cooked them the next morning which reduces the cooking time to about 10 minutes for me.  Still the same wonderful taste, but this method loses quite a lot of the whole grain sensation in the mouth.I was in the market for a rice cooker and while investigating them I noticed that some have a setting for porridge.  When I made my choice of the Panasonic SR-DE103 rice cooker it was partially because I wanted to use it to cook these oats.  The only drawback is that the rice cooker will only cook two servings at a time because the oats foam and bubble up so much during cooking.  Any more than two servings and they will be bubbling out of the steam vent of the cooker!  It also takes one hour to cook those two servings, but I can be off doing other things while the cooker takes care of the oats.  The oats cooked in the rice cooker have the same taste and texture as those cooked for the 35 minute method on the stove.This product is delightful.  I do add a tiny pinch of salt during the cooking time.  They are wonderful with either white sugar, brown sugar, honey, maple syrup, butter, or just completely unadorned.  And, which is very important, a serving of these steel cut oats stick with me and I don't find myself wanting to eat a second breakfast two hours later.

I am generally a fan of crackers with a cheese filling, but the flavor of the cheese filling only moderately enthused me.  I thought the flavor could have been stronger and there could have been more cheese filling.  I could taste the flavor, but it sometimes got lost in the cracker flavor, which is good.  Indeed, the more I chewed a Crackerful, the more flavor I seemed to get from the cracker.This product proclaims on the front that it is an ""excellent source of fiber.""  One individual package has five grams of fiber, which is about 20% of the daily-recommended value of fiber.  However, those five grams of fiber is connected with 7 grams of total fat and 2 grams of saturated fat.  The total calories in the little bar are 130.  In my mind, connecting five grams of fiber to 7 grams of fat would argue against Crackerfuls being an ""excellent"" source of fiber.Another thing that influences my opinion of ""excellent"" is the list of ingredients, which extends for half the side of the box.  There are preservatives and all sorts of artificial ingredients.  What kind of person thinks a lengthy list of artificial ingredients and 7 grams of fat leads to the conclusion of ""excellent""?  Not that I am pitching any particular product, but two Fiber Choice tablets have 4 grams of fiber, 16 calories, and no fat.  The Fiber Choice is significantly cheaper and has eight ingredients.  You tell me which product you would classify as an ""excellent"" source of fiber, or at least a ""good"" source of fiber.  Perhaps excellent would be raw vegetables or fruit.I also think Crackerfuls are relatively expensive considering the available options.  For example, Austin cheese crackers tend to be somewhere around $0.17 to $0.20 per ounce.  Crackerfuls cost about $0.92 per ounce, depending on the quantity you buy.Moving beyond price and the hyperbole of advertising, I think the packaging is good.  Each Crackerful has its own individual package, which means that you can throw them in a lunch box or your pocket and not have to worry about them getting stale or soggy.Bottom line:  I like these crackers.  They have good flavor and texture and their package makes them portable.  While I panned the ""excellent"" nature of the fiber, I consider crackers like these a snack and having fiber is neither make or break for the cracker.  A bigger hurdle is the price, which I think is high as compared to alternatives.  The price suggests this product is more of a luxury than an everyday snack cracker.Good luck!

It came pretty fast, in a semi-liquid state but not leaking; rather well packaged. I let it melt completely in a warm room (CO melts at about 80 deg F) and then put it in the fridge to let it solidify. One of the reasons I did (and always do) that is to smooth out the texture: as is, every type of CO I've tried comes in like a bunch of white fibers stuck in more even liquid, but if you thaw it completely and then freeze, it becomes all evenly semi-transparent, like one thick candle sort of thing. It probably doesn't matter; just a personal quirk, I guess.Anyway, this is good stuff: the taste is nice -- very good for sweetich things like carrots or plums, for example (I always have a bowl of very lightly steamed carrots around, and I snack on them, taking one and dipping it into CO, which is good for two reasons: first, it tastes great, and second, carotene is fat-soluble so you need to combine carrots with some sort of fat or it won't be used by the body well).All in all, there isn't much to say -- CO is CO is CO; this kind is no different from other types I've tried. CO in general is shamelessly hyped as a sort of panacea from every health problem known to man; this is mostly lies, but two things are true: it is tasty, and it's good for skin/hair (I've tried both, and it's true, it works). Don't believe anything else and don't ""take"" it daily as if it were a medicine: it's pure saturated fat and that's the end of it: it will raise your cholesterol as any other kind of saturated fat. As far as its being a weight-loss agent, this is not a complete lie, but remember, it works only if you _substitute_ CO for other kinds of saturated fats (that means quit eating butter, meat, etc.) If, otoh, you simply _add_ it to your normal diet, you're not gonna lose any weight -- instead, you're gonna gain weight at least as good as you would otherwise + increase your cholesterol. But if you decide to substitute, do not think it's an easy choice: CO is pure saturated fat, whereas other sources of saturated fats (butter, meat, etc.) come with a lot of nutritional goodness like vitamins, proteins, and the like -- things that CO is wholly devoid of. So my suggestion, for what it's worth (not much, I know) is to use CO just as another agreeable food to be used in moderation, not a magic medicine. I read somewhere that a 40-sh male in good health on a 2000 cal/day diet can get 200 calories from saturated fats w/o harming himself.One other thing I wanted to mention: the jar says it's ""pure extra virgin"" -- keep in mind that ""extra virgin"" is meaningful only when applied to olive oil. That is because there are specific and stringent industry standards stipulating what constitutes ""virgin"", ""extra virgin"", etc. There are no such standards about any other oils, so saying your CO is ""extra virgin"" communicates zero useful information and is no more than disingenuous hand-waving. It's like Nutiva says on their jars ""no cholesterol!"". No kidding, it's like wood-free nails. Of course plant-derived foods have no cholesterol, but BS rules in this industry, so just be aware of what's what and smart enough to dismiss useless hype like claims of a CO being ""extra virgin"".OK, there's really no more to say: as long as you use this tasty substance rationally, it's good stuff, so bottomline is: recommended -- except for one thing: just as I was deciding it's time to post a review and navigating to this page, I noticed that the price went up by the mind-blowing 60 percent since, not just since I bought it (two weeks ago), but literally within the last few days. Does my salary go up 60 percent in a couple of days? No. So, while the product is good and I can't give it less than five stars, I will suggest you do not reward naked greed and at least try to find better-priced alternatives. Especially in this economic environment that we have right now. The current price here is even higher than it is in Wegman's (brick-and-mortar grocery store; they carry it, but it's more than the seven bucks I bought it for here).PS. Btw, I see now someone reports that this oil comes in a glass jar: this is a bare-faced lie. The jar is transparent plastic, quite soft actually, so you can't _honestly_ mistake it for glass. Be extremely suspicious about these massive five-star reviews (here and elsewhere); I for a long time have a feeling those are posted by manufacturers' employees to create hype (and why not? Amazon does nothing to guard against fake reviews; all one needs to do in order to start posting reviews (real OR fake) is buy something once from this site). Some reviews read like the reviewer hasn't actually seen the product in question and is interested only in adding another five-star rating, not the review.PPS.

It is not important if the oil or the tablet is even frozen at the time of production till you consume since any seed, and I mean any type of seed regardless of the brand will go rancid once ground and cracked open since the shell, the protection is removed which will allow air and moisture access the oil of the seed much quicker than when the seed is in a complete un-hulled form. The best example of rancidity is brown rice. Place some brown rice in freezer and you will notice in few months it will not even cook since the oils have gone rancid even if it was kept in a sealed container in the freezer regardless. Chia is the only seed that does not need to be ground in order for human body to digest and get the nutrients and can be stored for longer time than any other seed without going rancid. Sesame seed, flax seed, etc. are so dense that will pass through human body when not ground making it absolutely worthless since human body can not digest it in its natural form.FIBER: Fiber is essential for body since fiber absorbs the unwanted liquid in the gut and body has to defecate that blown up fiber which in return lowers cholesterol, glucose, blood pressure, etc. and brings comfort and efficiency to human body unlike fat which stays in human body unless needed for energy. Flax is high in fiber.MINERALS: Flax is one of the kings of nutrients when it comes to minerals and so important to me as a whole delicious seed; highest ALA, high magnesium, high potassium, calcium with the healthiest fat.Accordingly for 100gr servings size of;SESAME__FLAX__CHIA__AMARANTH__QUINOA__HEMP__PISTACHIO__ALMOND__CASHEW__PEANUTCALORIES565__534__490__371__368__567__557__575__553__585SAT FAT34__18__16__7__4__17__27__19__39__34CALCIUM99__26__63__16__5__0__11__26__4__5MAGNESIUM89__98__0__62__49__167__30__67__73__44POTASSIUM14__23__5__15__16__167__29__20__19__19ZINC48__29__23__19__21__83__15__21__39__22FIBER47__109__151__8__11__4 __41__49__13__32PHYTOSTEROLS714__0__0__0__0__N/A__214__0__0__0FRESHNESS: Fresh means nutritious and delicious. I consume lots of seeds, beans, grains, vegetables, etc. and freshness is a priority regardless of the brand so I always purchase my food ingredients in small quantities from reputable sellers with high turnover. When fresh, food is nutritious and that goes for any food in any form, from frozen to canned. Fresh food is nutritious as well as delicious since nutrients give food its delicious taste. When old or rancid, nutrients are gone and any food item becomes an empty calories with no taste and absolutely worthless regardless of the brand or price, organic or conventional. For few years I consumed seeds in oil form since physicians advised me to do so not knowing that majority are not aware that seeds hardly offer any nutrients unless; seeds are fresh, not old which means rancid, not in oil form, not in supplement form, not hulled, ground and consumed within few days, kept in dark cold temperatures, away from light-sun-moisture since the oil in seeds and nuts go rancid regardless. That is why brown rice which has its nutrients will go rancid even if kept in freezer while white rice will last for years at room temperature since it hardly has any nutrients or oil. I ground in my coffee grinder sesame, flax, chia, amaranth, hemp then add cocoa, isolate protein, soy milk and consume it before my workouts on daily basis for its vitamins, minerals, protein and many nutrients, without much spike in my glucose. Un-hulled seeds are full of nutrients. I never consume hulled seeds which are empty calories, absolutely worthless since the nutrients have been removed.OMEGA-3: You will never see ALA on any fish you purchase. Infact you will never see ALA on any fish oil supplement either, you will only see EPA and DHA. ALA is not the same as EPA or DHA. That is true for any brand of flaxseed regardless if such flaxseed oil is in solid form, oil form in a bottle or in a capsule form. Greens, veges, nuts, seeds and fruits do not offer any Omega-3 in form of EPA/DHA since omega-3 EPA/DHA is an animal source. There are two major types of omega-3 fatty acids in our diets: One type is alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which is found in plants the other type, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is found in fatty fish.

The taste definitely tastes fruity, but I could not detect a blueberry flavor at all.  Rather, as other reviewers have suggested, the taste is more reminiscent of Fig Newtons, most likely because the first ingredient is actually dates (blueberries were significantly further down the list).

I do not buy rainbow quinoas since they sell for a high price without having enough red or black but more of white but C & F sells one of the best white and red mix since C & F offers more red than white in the mix. I usually buy the white, red and black separately and mix as I wish as well since quinoa is just an important part of my diet.KEEN-Waah... A complete protein source, a seed related to other healthy cousins like spinach and beets. In a pot I place quinoa, frozen peas, carrots, corn, add water and tomato paste. Spinach is added at the end the last minute. Stewing tomatoes for a half hour increases the cancer fighting lycopene content by 35 percent. Cooking also unlocks another nutrient, beta-carotene, in corn and carrots since heat breaks down the fibrous cell walls, releasing more of these antioxidants. The same goes for spinach but then you need to get your vitamin C from something else since that is the first vitamin which is depleted with heat. I saute lots of onion separately then in ten minutes I add paprika, cumin, dillweed, gram marsala, crushed red pepper, turmeric and lots of garlic2 x 2 Pound Fresh Garlic USA California Heirloom Monviso Gilroy Finest (4 Pounds Total), mix it well and add the mix to the pot and let it sit without heat for five minutes. This is what vegans consume instead of beef since it is a complete protein. Greens, vegetables, nuts, seeds, etc. may have protein but the fact is that only quinoa has a complete protein and all others do not since all others are missing few amino acids here and there but not quinoa. I rarely ever consume beef, chicken, etc. so fish and quinoa are the only source of complete protein with all amino acids for me. Organic, whole grain, very fulfilling due to some starch with host of vitamins, minerals that no beef or chicken can even come close to. Cooks in ten minutes with some water, no fat, no salt, no sugar... I consume it with eggplant, onions, okra, smoked hearings, curry type dishes with lots of spices and delicious juices. I never ever have to wash and rinse before cooking either. I keep the uncooked portions in double zip lock bags in freezer. I consume so much that I never have to worry about the unused portion going rancid and unlike brown rice which loses its oil in less than six months and becomes worthless even if kept in freezer, quinoa will last longer. Obviously I never ever do that with any food since I only purchase what I need in order to get the nutrients which are a healthy portion of my diet. Gluten free, the best product for me when I go camping since all I do is add lemon and tomato and that way I never have to worry about paying arm and leg for that lousy, awful tasting dry foods. I ground chia+flax+sesame, mix it with cocoa+isolate+soy milk before my workouts every single day or no workout regardless. Three tbsp of quinoa in my power drink offers me 4gr of pure, complete protein with all amino acids. I add organic paprika to regular yellow quinoa and it turns the dish into a beautiful red color. Healthy, healthier and healthiest of many seeds, delicious sprouts only in 3 days with all amino acids. I am an athlete with a healthy diet. I used to consume brown rice heavily years ago but no longer. I can consume quinoa with tomato and lemon juice and it is the best food I can take with me anywhere on any sports trip and I do not even have to wash it either. Delicious, delicious, delicious.FRESHNESS: Fresh means nutritious and delicious. I consume lots of seeds, beans, grains, vegetables, etc. and freshness is a priority regardless of the brand so I always purchase my food ingredients in small quantities from reputable sellers with high turnover. When fresh, food is nutritious and that goes for any food in any form, from frozen to canned. Fresh food is nutritious as well as delicious since nutrients give food its delicious taste. When old or rancid, nutrients are gone and any food item becomes an empty calories with no taste and absolutely worthless regardless of the brand or price, organic or conventional. For few years I consumed seeds in oil form since physicians advised me to do so not knowing that majority are not aware that seeds hardly offer any nutrients unless; seeds are fresh, not old which means rancid, not in oil form, not in supplement form, not hulled, ground and consumed within few days, kept in dark cold temperatures, away from light-sun-moisture since the oil in seeds and nuts go rancid regardless. That is why brown rice which has its nutrients will go rancid even if kept in freezer while white rice will last for years at room temperature since it hardly has any nutrients or oil. I ground in my coffee grinder sesame, flax, chia, amaranth, hemp then add cocoa, isolate protein, soy milk and consume it before my workouts on daily basis for its vitamins, minerals, protein and many nutrients, without much spike in my glucose. Un-hulled seeds are full of nutrients. I never consume hulled seeds which are empty calories, absolutely worthless since the nutrients have been removed.STARCH: Some carbohydrates, such as sugars and most starch are rapidly digested and absorbed as glucose into the body through the small intestine and subsequently used for short-term energy needs or stored. Resistant starch on the other hand, resists digestion and passes through to the large intestine where it acts like dietary fiber. Sugar, honey, maple syrup, white flour, white rice, whole-grain pastry flour, packaged cold cereals, commercial fruit juices, and fruit-juice sweetened beverages are the same foods some dentists claim rots the teeth from the inside out by changing the balance and ratio of calcium to phosphorous in the bloodstream. Your immune system goes down when you wolf down sweets, especially around events and holiday meals. High Glycemic foods quickly turn to sugar in your blood stream, causing excess insulin to pour into your blood to get rid of the excess sugar. The excess insulin pushes the calcium and fat into your arteries, especially if you have only a few cholesterol receptors on your liver (which is genetic). Whole wheat and white bread have essentially the same impact on blood sugar so I try to consume bread with whole sprouted grains, even flourless breads, and no-yeast breads. Black beans, northern beans, navy beans, red kidney beans, lentils, split peas, black-eyed peas, brown rice, rolled oats, millet, corn, black rice are all Resistance Starch. King of starch for me is quinoa and Navy Beans before and post expedition trips, 17.6gr vs. 15.4gr for 100gr serving. No wonder the price of quinoa is going up, up, up...

However, it wasn't bad. It is a bit bland and does have a few tiny pieces of meat in it. It could use an addition of onion and garlic, and yet, in the right circumstances, such as needing a quick inexpensive meal, this would certainly be filling and, if not exactly scrumptuous, still decently tastey that you wouldn't mind eating it.

It's definitely acceptible.In short, keep a few of these in your cupboard, or take on your next trip if you will have a microwave, and have a quick pasta meal when you need it.

I purchased this for my friend since she does not want to go through the process of grinding. If grinding is an issue, then this is the next best option, only if it is from a reputable brand but rancid is a serious issue with all flax seeds regardless of the brand, regardless organic or conventional...OILS: Rancid is a process of mother nature and has nothing to do with organic, conventional, GMO or the type of seed since rancid has to do with oil. It is not important if the oil or the tablet is even frozen at the time of production till you consume since any seed, and I mean any type of seed regardless of the brand will go rancid once ground and cracked open since the shell, the protection is removed which will allow air and moisture access the oil of the seed much quicker than when the seed is in a complete un-hulled form. The best example of rancidity is brown rice. Place some brown rice in freezer and you will notice in few months it will not even cook since the oils have gone rancid even if it was kept in a sealed container in the freezer regardless. Chia is the only seed that does not need to be ground in order for human body to digest and get the nutrients and can be stored for longer time than any other seed without going rancid. Sesame seed, flax seed, etc. are so dense that will pass through human body when not ground making it absolutely worthless since human body can not digest it in its natural form.FIBER: Fiber is essential for body since fiber absorbs the unwanted liquid in the gut and body has to defecate that blown up fiber which in return lowers cholesterol, glucose, blood pressure, etc. and brings comfort and efficiency to human body unlike fat which stays in human body unless needed for energy. Flax is high in fiber.MINERALS: Flax is one of the kings of nutrients when it comes to minerals and so important to me as a whole delicious seed; highest ALA, high magnesium, high potassium, calcium with the healthiest fat.Accordingly for 100gr servings size of;SESAME__FLAX__CHIA__AMARANTH__QUINOA__HEMP__PISTACHIO__ALMOND__CASHEW__PEANUTCALORIES565__534__490__371__368__567__557__575__553__585SAT FAT34__18__16__7__4__17__27__19__39__34CALCIUM99__26__63__16__5__0__11__26__4__5MAGNESIUM89__98__0__62__49__167__30__67__73__44POTASSIUM14__23__5__15__16__167__29__20__19__19ZINC48__29__23__19__21__83__15__21__39__22FIBER47__109__151__8__11__4 __41__49__13__32PHYTOSTEROLS714__0__0__0__0__N/A__214__0__0__0FRESHNESS: Fresh means nutritious and delicious. I consume lots of seeds, beans, grains, vegetables, etc. and freshness is a priority regardless of the brand so I always purchase my food ingredients in small quantities from reputable sellers with high turnover. When fresh, food is nutritious and that goes for any food in any form, from frozen to canned. Fresh food is nutritious as well as delicious since nutrients give food its delicious taste. When old or rancid, nutrients are gone and any food item becomes an empty calories with no taste and absolutely worthless regardless of the brand or price, organic or conventional. For few years I consumed seeds in oil form since physicians advised me to do so not knowing that majority are not aware that seeds hardly offer any nutrients unless; seeds are fresh, not old which means rancid, not in oil form, not in supplement form, not hulled, ground and consumed within few days, kept in dark cold temperatures, away from light-sun-moisture since the oil in seeds and nuts go rancid regardless. That is why brown rice which has its nutrients will go rancid even if kept in freezer while white rice will last for years at room temperature since it hardly has any nutrients or oil. I ground in my coffee grinder sesame, flax, chia, amaranth, hemp then add cocoa, isolate protein, soy milk and consume it before my workouts on daily basis for its vitamins, minerals, protein and many nutrients, without much spike in my glucose. Un-hulled seeds are full of nutrients. I never consume hulled seeds which are empty calories, absolutely worthless since the nutrients have been removed.OMEGA-3: You will never see ALA on any fish you purchase. Infact you will never see ALA on any fish oil supplement either, you will only see EPA and DHA. ALA is not the same as EPA or DHA. That is true for any brand of flaxseed regardless if such flaxseed oil is in solid form, oil form in a bottle or in a capsule form. Greens, veges, nuts, seeds and fruits do not offer any Omega-3 in form of EPA/DHA since omega-3 EPA/DHA is an animal source. There are two major types of omega-3 fatty acids in our diets: One type is alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which is found in plants the other type, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is found in fatty fish. The body partially converts ALA to EPA and DHA. There is no proof what percent of ALA gets converted by human body to EPA or DHA. You can consume all ALAs that you want and depending to your genes it may never turn any into omega-3. Blood test is the only way to see the affects. I get omega 3 from sardines although flaxseed is an important part of my diet since flaxseed offers so many nutrients. Flaxseed offers more ALA than chia for $1.99 a pound not $15 a pound, 22.8gr vs. 17.8gr. ANSWERNOTFOUND",brand,"(18, 23)",2,0.0,False

Still, this is not bad as a snack food for when you're not home. Because they are individually wrapped, you could easily toss one into the lunch box. Inside, you'll find two tasty crackers and reasonably good cheese.Judging by the nutrional statement, this product is aimed at someone who cares about fat, calories, sodium, and cholesterol. You would not want to eat a package of them, but one is reasonable as a snack. I judge the nutrition as approaching reasonably healthy crackers (like ak-nak) and fresh cheese, and less chemicals than I expected for packaged food.CRACKERRitz has their name from crackers, but these aren't your father's Ritz crackers. They are made with whole grains, and probably less fat than regular Ritz crackers. They have 8g whole grain per packet. ak-nak (a popular low-fat, organically grown whole wheat cracker) is about 11g whole grain for two crackers. The daily recommended amount is 48g, so this does contribute meaningfully.The cracker by itself tastes good, has a nice crunch, and if it was available without the cheese, is good enough for me to consider getting as a cracker for a party.CHEESEI was suspicious about cheese for this product that is made to go without refrigeration. Well, it tastes like cheese, because that seems to be mostly what is in it. The filling is made with semisoft cheese, two kinds of cheddar (well, cheddar is listed twice), and some asiago. It does not have the smooth texture of conventional cheese, but it does taste good.NUTRITIONThe packet of two crackers with cheese weighs 1 ounce, and has 130 calories per packet, 7g fat (11% of daily value), 210 mg salt (11%), Cholesterol &lt;5mg (1%). As a comparison, 1 ounce of potato chips we have show 140 calories, 8g fat, 400 mg salt, so the crackers are somewhat better in all ways except the cheese has cholesterol and the chips do not.The package I received had an expiration date about 4 months out, and this is a new product, so they don't put enough chemicals in them to give them a long shelf life. The listed chemicals are sodium phosphate (probably used as a preservative for the cheese), and tricalcium phosphate (an anti-caking agent, the same chemical that our bones and teeth are made of). I looked both up on the Web and did not see anything bad about their use.Corn syrup is one of the ingredients. There must not be a lot, since this product is not sweet.PACKAGINGWorth mentioning, especially if you intend to buy on the Web and have delivered. It came in a bubble-wrap bag, and the package inside was crushed. However, the individual packets have u-shaped cardboard to protect the crackers from breakage, and only two were broken, and they were broken in half (not into many pieces).OVERALLThese are better than I expected, both in nutrition and in taste. I think they make a fine portable snack. Four stars because I still prefer fresh cheese with my crackers. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2984, 2998)",5,0.0,False

There is also no way to see how much is left in the bottle because of the opaque wrapper.3) Questionable benefits - The label says this stuff adds vitamins C, B3, B5, B6 and B12, caffeine, taurine and electrolytes.  It gives odd measures of each benefit - sometimes as a % (presumably of RDA) and sometimes as mg.  For electrolytes it says it has two lightningbolts worth.  Most of this stuff you can get easily elsewhere from a normal diet.  Taurine has been proven to be of no established benfit.  Caffeine? Well, I can't really comment on why you would want that in an energy drink.  Many of these ""benefits"" are also not clearly placed in an energy drink or a recovery drink.  I have absolutely no idea how many electrolytes are contained in two lightningbolts.  It is not a measure I am familiar with.Two stars, not one, because it did not make me sick or anything.

When I got this sampler box in the mail I tried them immediately and have some thoughts about them.First, they come off tasting like weak soup in a lot of ways. The flavors are very muted, as one might expect. I discovered that if I boiled the bags in water for 10 minutes rather than steep them as tea in a cup, the flavors are considerably improved and strengthened. Each bag contains either decaf green tea or decaf black tea, but I didn't taste tea flavors in anything I brewed.Dieters might well like how this tea feels a bit more like a foodstuff than tea normally does. At 5 calories per steeped cup of tea, it's a very light snack at best, but with whole-grain crackers and perhaps a bit of cheese, it'd feel like a decent lunch. I can't imagine drinking a cup of this tea by itself and feeling sated. The cup I tried was drunk at midday with no breakfast in my stomach yet, and it definitely didn't curb any hunger pangs. Middle-aged and Boomer dieters familiar with powdered bouillon packets in hot water will find these a considerably upmarket and modernized version of the old Herb-Ox standby. Once you get past the ""weak soup"" feeling, the flavors are light and bright. The Tomato Mint soup in particular functioned well as a drink.These do make wonderful poaching liquids for soups. I just got finished with an egg-noodle soup made with the Spinach Chive tea and thought it was delicious. I boiled the teabag in the water for 10 minutes, then stirred in the noodles to cook. I couldn't taste much of spinach or chives, but the broth was quite good at any rate. It's a pity they have actual tea leaves in them, or I'd have just ripped the bags open to use as seasoning for the food. I loved the complexity of flavor they produced when boiled that way and used as part of a meal. It's an off-label use, but one I recommend wholeheartedly.I can't see myself buying these except for cooking purposes--which may well happen as I did like the broth made from them--but dieters may well find them useful as actual tea to drink. I would recommend that anybody using these boil the bags rather than steep them to get the full flavor from them. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The flavors are very muted,"(232, 258)",1,0.3,False

No preservatives have been added. The label indicates 80 calories per serving, but defines a serving as 8 ounces. Because the bottle is 11.5 ounces, drinking a full bottle means an intake of 115 calories.Chantea won the Best New Product award in 2011 at the World Tea Trade Show. It also won Buyers' Choice and 2nd place Ready to Drink tea awards at the North American Tea Championship.Of the four available Chantea flavors (original, peach, lemon, passion fruit) I only tried passion fruit. My first reaction was surprise at the amount of pulp it contained. My second and sustained reaction was that the drink was tangy and tart - more than I would have liked. The taste is pleasant but rich and full-bodied - it reminded me of fresh grapefruit juice, but is a little sweeter.Although I may recommend it to friends and try another flavor, I am more inclined to drink acai blueberry vitamin water zero, which I find particularly delicious. However, these Chantea drinks offer a considerable additional benefit related to their aloe vera and green tea ingredients.Aloe vera is a succulent plant originating in Africa but now cultivated worldwide. Egyptian papyri reveal that it was used for healing as early as 16th century B.C.  Sources dating back to 1st century A.D. refer to its use in herbal medicine.Although no scientific evidence yet attests to its medicinal properties, aloe vera is widely associated with helping diabetes and elevated blood lipids, and improving glucose levels. It is most recommended for reducing symptoms of heartburn, irritable bowel syndrome, abdominal cramps, diarrhea and ulcerative colitis. It is an ingredient in yoghurt, and has no known side effects.Green tea, in contrast, has been the focus of dozens of scientific studies, although it has not been reviewed by the FDA. Made from the leaves of camellia senensis, which originated in China but is now cultivated worldwide, it contains antioxidative and anticarcinogenic flavonoids, as well as caffeine.Many studies suggest that:a) Lowers the risk of heart disease, cancer (breast, prostrate, colon), kidney stones, arthritis and dental cavitiesb) Boosts the metabolic rate 4-17%, helping reduce body fatc) Strengthens the immune system, and improves bone densityd) Reduces blood pressure and symptoms of depressione) Helps rescue damaged neurons and prevent brain cells from dying.Note however that the U.S. Pharmacopeia has warned that green tea in quantity does increase the risk of liver damage, especially when taken on an empty stomach. It is also contraindicated for use with the anti-cancer drug bortezomib, and it may reduce the effectiveness of anticoagulants.Those of you wanting a healthy, immune-boosting chilled fruity drink are likely to benefit from this product. However, taste is a very individual preference. If you like tart, full-bodied flavors, you may really enjoy Chantea's passion fruit green tea aloe vera drink.

I can see why it is called ""honeybush,"" as the taste and aroma truly do resemble honey. It has a mellow, natural sweetness to it that really does not need sweetening, and a very mild, easy taste that reminds me of chamomile tea, in that it has a soft, understated character with no bitter note or aftertaste, and a bit of a woodsy note. I have never added milk to this tea, but I may try it and see what it does. I love it straight, and have even enjoyed the random mug I have accidentally allowed to cool down too much. I have been able to have it either in the early morning, midday, with meals, between meals, on an empty stomach, or very late at night--all with no issues. The taste is honey-like and light, with the tiniest hint of mesquite when freshly poured. If it sits for a considerable amount of time, it develops an additional note that reminds me of fig leaves. This is a completely caffeine free tea that is even given to tiny children and to people taking meds, as it does not interact adversely with anything or have any known adverse effects to the health. I have heard it is great for the skin, and perhaps it is all true, from what I have noticed. I would call this a nourishing tea. If it has any calming effects, they are probably all cerebral, and it may just be due to how pleasant and easy it is to drink, and how relaxing pleasant things usually are.

Enough so that I roast my own beans and grind them fresh before each cup and I look down a bit on Starbucks and Peet's. Still, just like I believe wine in a bag or box could be good if you actually use good wine - better, maybe, depending on the wine and what you intend to use it for - I also believe that using good beans and processing them properly you could, maybe, get an excellent cup of coffee in a can.Normally I wouldn't be trying coffee in a can simply because it usually seems to have milk in it and I don't consume any dairy, but this illy issimo contains just coffee, sugar, potassium bicarbonate, and potassium citrate. I'm not sure what the last two ingredients are for, but wikipedia says they both impart a slightly salty taste and are used to regulate ph...so maybe it's either of those or both. The can says ""100% natural arabica"". Not sure what the ""natural"" part is supposed to mean - maybe it's just a way to sneak ""natural"" onto the label - it's a term that's not really regulated so it's slapped on a lot of stuff without really meaning anything. Not too impressed with the ""arabica"" part...75% of all coffee produced is arabica and some of it is pretty nasty dross. Still, illy is supposed to have a good reputation, so despite the meaningless hype on the can I have tentative high hopes for it.These cans are kind of small, closer to a Red Bull than your traditional can of soda. I put my can in the fridge to chill it, then opened it and took a sip. Well, blech...I did not like that at all, but then I normally don't like coffee and sugar without any (non-dairy) milk, so not really a surprise. I put four ice cubes in a glass and then the coffee and it filled my glass most of the way. The rest of the glass I filled with one of my two favorite soy milks, Sunrich Naturals (which is the one they use at Blue Bottle) gave a little stir and sipped again. This time, it actually tasted good! Good enough to drink the entire thing, even though really I'd had my coffee for the day. Oh yeah, and better than an iced latte from Peet's or Starbucks!Would I drink this again? Yes, actually I would. The main thing stopping me would be that I'd only want to drink it if I had access to a glass with ice and some soy (or other non-dairy) milk, which certainly could happen but if I'm at home I might just as well roast and grind my own beans and if I'm not at home all of a sudden the whole ice/glass/soymilk thing requires some pre-planning. They should make illy issimo canned coffee drinks with soymilk right in the can...then I bet I could think of lots of reasons to keep a case of it on hand.

Coconut sugar appears to be one of those with some benefits over other sweeteners.Coconut sugar is derived from the flowers of the coconut tree and is an organic, sustainable natural sweetener. This sugar has a low glycemic index and is also a nutrient powerhouse, filled with lots of vitamins, minerals and amino acids. Coconut sugar is minimally processed, unbleached and contains no preservatives.Coconut sugar is made from the sugar blossoms of fresh coconuts found in the tropics. It is harvested by slicing the bud of the coconut tree flower to release the sap or coconut nectar. This nectar is then boiled into a thick caramel and dried into crystals. Nothing is removed during this process. Coconut sugar is similar in texture and taste to brown sugar but far outweighs its nutritional profile.In terms of nutrients, coconut sugar contains the minerals calcium, magnesium, potassium, zinc, iron, copper, manganese, phosphorus and boron. It also contains 12 of the B vitamins, including thiamine, riboflavin, pyridoxine, nicotinic acid, biotin, pyridoxal and inositol. Coconut sugar contains 16 out of the 20 amino acids. This sugar is especially high in the amino acids glutamic acid, which makes glutamine, threonine, aspartic acid and serine.We use it in place of brown sugar for baking purposes. It tastes a lot like brown sugar but it is a lot drier. So, when you open the bag and check it out, it doesn't clump together, but is loose like the texture of white sugar. It has a low glycemic index which is another plus. It is not low calorie however. We like this brand and the Amazon price is better than what we can find in the store.

It is not important if the oil or the tablet is even frozen at the time of production till you consume since any seed, and I mean any type of seed regardless of the brand will go rancid once ground and cracked open since the shell, the protection is removed which will allow air and moisture access the oil of the seed much quicker than when the seed is in a complete un-hulled form. The best example of rancidity is brown rice. Place some brown rice in freezer and you will notice in few months it will not even cook since the oils have gone rancid even if it was kept in a sealed container in the freezer regardless. Chia is the only seed that does not need to be ground in order for human body to digest and get the nutrients and can be stored for longer time than any other seed without going rancid. Sesame seed, flax seed, etc. are so dense that will pass through human body when not ground making it absolutely worthless since human body can not digest it in its natural form.FIBER: Fiber is essential for body since fiber absorbs the unwanted liquid in the gut and body has to defecate that blown up fiber which in return lowers cholesterol, glucose, blood pressure, etc. and brings comfort and efficiency to human body unlike fat which stays in human body unless needed for energy. Flax is high in fiber.MINERALS: Flax is one of the kings of nutrients when it comes to minerals and so important to me as a whole delicious seed; highest ALA, high magnesium, high potassium, calcium with the healthiest fat.Accordingly for 100gr servings size of;SESAME__FLAX__CHIA__AMARANTH__QUINOA__HEMP__PISTACHIO__ALMOND__CASHEW__PEANUTCALORIES565__534__490__371__368__567__557__575__553__585SAT FAT34__18__16__7__4__17__27__19__39__34CALCIUM99__26__63__16__5__0__11__26__4__5MAGNESIUM89__98__0__62__49__167__30__67__73__44POTASSIUM14__23__5__15__16__167__29__20__19__19ZINC48__29__23__19__21__83__15__21__39__22FIBER47__109__151__8__11__4 __41__49__13__32PHYTOSTEROLS714__0__0__0__0__N/A__214__0__0__0FRESHNESS: Fresh means nutritious and delicious. I consume lots of seeds, beans, grains, vegetables, etc. and freshness is a priority regardless of the brand so I always purchase my food ingredients in small quantities from reputable sellers with high turnover. When fresh, food is nutritious and that goes for any food in any form, from frozen to canned. Fresh food is nutritious as well as delicious since nutrients give food its delicious taste. When old or rancid, nutrients are gone and any food item becomes an empty calories with no taste and absolutely worthless regardless of the brand or price, organic or conventional. For few years I consumed seeds in oil form since physicians advised me to do so not knowing that majority are not aware that seeds hardly offer any nutrients unless; seeds are fresh, not old which means rancid, not in oil form, not in supplement form, not hulled, ground and consumed within few days, kept in dark cold temperatures, away from light-sun-moisture since the oil in seeds and nuts go rancid regardless. That is why brown rice which has its nutrients will go rancid even if kept in freezer while white rice will last for years at room temperature since it hardly has any nutrients or oil. I ground in my coffee grinder sesame, flax, chia, amaranth, hemp then add cocoa, isolate protein, soy milk and consume it before my workouts on daily basis for its vitamins, minerals, protein and many nutrients, without much spike in my glucose. Un-hulled seeds are full of nutrients. I never consume hulled seeds which are empty calories, absolutely worthless since the nutrients have been removed.OMEGA-3: You will never see ALA on any fish you purchase. Infact you will never see ALA on any fish oil supplement either, you will only see EPA and DHA. ALA is not the same as EPA or DHA. That is true for any brand of flaxseed regardless if such flaxseed oil is in solid form, oil form in a bottle or in a capsule form. Greens, veges, nuts, seeds and fruits do not offer any Omega-3 in form of EPA/DHA since omega-3 EPA/DHA is an animal source. There are two major types of omega-3 fatty acids in our diets: One type is alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which is found in plants the other type, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is found in fatty fish. The body partially converts ALA to EPA and DHA. There is no proof what percent of ALA gets converted by human body to EPA or DHA. You can consume all ALAs that you want and depending to your genes it may never turn any into omega-3. Blood test is the only way to see the affects. I get omega 3 from sardines although flaxseed is an important part of my diet since flaxseed offers so many nutrients.

As with any coffee one is not familiar with, it takes some experimentation to figure out how to make it ""just right.""  That's my experience anyhow.  So, I usually brew it up a couple different ways to see how it will come out and adjust from there.First, I followed the instructions on the package and made a pot in a drip coffee maker.  This produced a strong coffee, but it was nasty!  The taste was like someone had dropped in an excessive amount of vanilla extract or sugar free vanilla flavoring.  Kind of like getting a vanilla latte in a tourist trap area.  The next pot, I backed off by reducing the grounds by two scoops and left the amount of water the same.  This produced a weaker but still good coffee taste with very mild hint of vanilla flavoring.  *Much better* in my opinion, and very palatable.  For the third pot, I went for iced coffee, cold brewing in a French press, using the original instructions. The product was very smooth and tasty.  Letting it sit in the fridge overnight after brewing enhanced the flavor.  Finally, I hot brewed it in the French press, again using the original mix ratio from the package.  Sadly, the taste again not so good, though not as bad as the first pot.In the end, I did find two brewing methods that I liked.  While I would have preferred a stronger vanilla flavor, I wasn't able to get it out of this product before I finished the package.  Perhaps some more experimenting is in order, but, for now I will stick with another brand that I already enjoy. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1713, 1727)",1,0.0,False

This is a very crisp, refreshing beverage that has just the right balance of fruit to carbonation, and a slight tartness that keeps it from being cloying or flabby. Some reviewers have commented and even complained about this sparkling juice having only the barest amount of carbonation.  Not so with the ones I have tried, so perhaps these other reviewers left the top open and allowed it to go flat or something. Believe me, this had lively carbonation, and a good, natural tasting tart orange flavor.  The size of the can is convenient, too - takes up hardly any space in the fridge or in the lunch sack.As part of the ""Vine"" program, I received and tasted three different flavors but Amazon will not allow me to publish a separate review of each flavor.  So I am combining them all into one.Apple flavor: like biting into a crisp, green apple and savoring the peel and the fruit/meat at the same time. It has nice, clean and refreshing flavors with an excellent balance of carbonation. Normally I am not a fan of apple juice or sparkling cider but this one I liked.  It is not cloying or flabby-tasting as I find most apple beverages to be, probably because this is green and not red apple-flavored.Grapefruit flavor: this was my least favorite of the bunch, but if you prefer a very tart flavor, this fits the bill nicely. Again, a good balance of carbonation, crisp, and refreshing, this had good pink grapefruit taste but I also detected a plastic-tasting element.  The aftertaste was pure grapefruit so I don't know where that plastic came from or where it went, but it did mar an otherwise nice drinking experience.Overall I rate these Izze beverages very high.  They taste good, they are refreshing, and come in convenient-sized cans that easily fit in the fridge or a lunch sack or back pack. Good products!

Light green puts the consumer in the sought-after mind frame of wanting to eat something healthy, light, and natural.  There is a promise that the product will be ""great for cooking, baking, and everyday sweetening.""The directions were slightly challenging. It is a granulated blend of ""naturally sweet stevia & pure cane sugar.""  The directions are to use a half cup in place of one cup of sugar. One pound equals the sweetness of two pounds of sugar. A serving size is  teaspoon, which contains 10 calories; therefore one teaspoon contains 20 calories, the same as a teaspoon of cane sugar. But one teaspoon of Sun Crystals is twice as sweet as a teaspoon of sugar. The math requires a small amount of thought. It's easy to get confused measuring out this blend of sugar and stevia.As the package says, ""Twice as as sweet so you only need half as much.""  That sentence means that you need only half as much sugar as you normally do. (I think!?)Cooking?  Baking?  I turned the package over to discover an enticing recipe for oatmeal raisin cookies.

Before making the cookies, I thought we could use some of it for everyday sweetening before making the cookies.  I stirred some into iced tea. Just like any teaspoon of cane sugar, it required extensive stirring to dissolve, and I found that I needed twice as much as half.Next I tried it in hot tea. In hot or cold tea, it tastes wonderful. It dissolves efficiently in hot tea. Soon I found myself drinking so much tea that I was consuming twice as much sugar as usual.  I love the taste of Sun Crystals!So did the other taste tester who shares tea in our office.  He drank cup after cup of delicious hot tea.

I couldn't make it past two sips before I just put it down and said ""enough of this madness!"".  I let my boyfriend try it too, and he said the same thing about the flavor - gross.  I know that different people have different tastes and all, and maybe there's someone out there that could stomach this, but I doubt it.  My personal advice to anyone who's checking this product out, just don't!

The Helper boxes use powdered cheese and a milk/water combo to make the cheese.

Also unfortunately, while the box says it holds ""single serve pods"" it does not specify that they're pods for a machine, or in fact what machines they work with.  The packets themselves say nothing at all about pods or machines.So here's the problem: I have a box of single serve coffee pods which don't really tell me much of anything, requested because I thought they were simply single-serve coffee bags, not unlike tea bags.  And I don't own a pod coffee maker.  I don't like them very much.  I'm going to have to improvise in order to do any sort of review.I tossed a couple of pods into my standard drip coffee maker and added two cups of water (The classic 6 oz cup by which coffee is still measured in spite of the fact that we now live in a world where 16 oz cups are considered small.) What I got back out was a brew that would make church coffee laugh derisively. So then I just threw two bags into a cup and added 12 oz of hot water, and let them steep until the brew looked darker, and that actually worked pretty well.  With due respect to the gentleman who said ""teabagging"" with these things doesn't work, I have to disagree.  It makes a decent enough cup.  The coffee isn't strong, but it is smooth, and has has the classic African warmth and brightness.In all fairness, the truest test of this coffee would be to use it in a pod-style coffee maker, but absent that, you can actually make a decent cup without much work.  Just remember that it's 1 pod to each 6 oz of water, no matter what the instructions say.Which brings me to a gripe.  Where the heck are people finding instructions?  There are none on the box, none on the individual packets.  The only instruction I found was on the pod itself.  One side says: ""This side down""  Seriously, even if your product is for a machine, it's a good idea to be clear about how to use the product in that machine.All in all, Marley Coffee got points for flavor but lost them for unnecessarily vague packaging and the fact that it's kind of pricey.  I don't honestly think that I'd change my review substantially even if I had a pod-style coffee maker to test it with, however if I do manage to find one and it changes my opinion, I will absolutely update this review.Amazon, you need to give a bit more information in your descriptions for Vine reviewers.

However, sometimes, it's not feasible to have fresh fruit on hand or you need something which will travel well and not weigh you down as much. This is good to have in your desk, a backpack, or in your car for a quick snack, but it is essentially dried apples in a different form. If you like dried apples a little, you may like this just a bit more.The main selling point of this over dried apples is that it's crunchier and the little round balls are more fun to eat. They have an intense apple flavor brought on by the apple bits and the concentrated apple juice. The juice gives them a fair amount of sweetness and the little morsels are held together with potato starch. The main disappointment I have with these is that the cinnamon is far too subdued. This is my personal preference, of course.

Of my four cans, one was nearly undamaged.  One had cosmetic damage in the form of a dented side.  The other two were dented to the extent of having sharp creases in the bottom and flaws near the seal lines at the top.  I never buy cans like those at the supermarket.COOKINGThe cooking went much better than I expected.  The evening before, I put 1/4 cup chopped black walnuts, 10 pitted prunes cut into pieces with scissors, and two cups of water into my saucepan.  I brought this mixture to a boil over a simmering-level flame on my propane stove.  I dumped in one-half-cup of McCann's steel cut oats and stirred.  I waited for the mixture to come to a boil again, stirred it a little, turned off the flame, put a lid on the saucepan, and went to bed.  In the morning I was surprised to find that it was perfectly edible with no further cooking.  I did heat it up again on the stove before serving but it stuck to the pot, so I think in the future I will microwave it right in the bowls just before serving it.EATINGThese oats were good, but it was hard to say if they were ""nuttier"" in flavor than the Old-Fashioned Rolled Oats which I had been eating because I cooked them both with nuts.  The texture was of course firmer.  I do like bulgar wheat and these oats are more like that in texture.  Since I was careful not to overcook the rolled oats, there was not much difference in the ""slime"" feel of the two, but the rolled oats were papery much like eating raw oatmeal cookie dough.NUTRITIONI found little difference between the nutritional content listed on the McCann steel cut can and that listed on the Old-Fashioned Rolled Oats container.  I had to do some Internet research to find the differences which turn out to be subtle but important for certain types of health conditions.  There is also the likelihood of the product simply being fresher due to less processing and better packaging at the mill.REPEAT PURCHASENow that I have found that the cooking of steel cut oats is much less intimidating than I had imagined, I will probably eat these in preferance to rolled oats in the future.  The possibility of adding them to soups and other cooked entrees in place of barley or bulgar wheat is a bonus.  However, I will probably try a more economical source as I am not convinced that Ireland's soil is superior to that in any other region in which oats are farmed, and metal cans with sharp creases and bent seams don't seem worth the extra cost.

The first thing I noticed was the bright green color of the package with the sunburst of granules.  Light green puts the consumer in the sought-after mind frame of wanting to eat something healthy, light, and natural.  There is a promise that the product will be ""great for cooking, baking, and everyday sweetening.""The directions were slightly challenging. It is a granulated blend of ""naturally sweet stevia & pure cane sugar.""  The directions are to use a half cup in place of one cup of sugar. One pound equals the sweetness of two pounds of sugar. A serving size is  teaspoon, which contains 10 calories; therefore one teaspoon contains 20 calories, the same as a teaspoon of cane sugar. But one teaspoon of Sun Crystals is twice as sweet as a teaspoon of sugar. The math requires a small amount of thought. It's easy to get confused measuring out this blend of sugar and stevia.As the package says, ""Twice as as sweet so you only need half as much.""  That sentence means that you need only half as much sugar as you normally do. (I think!?)Cooking?  Baking?  I turned the package over to discover an enticing recipe for oatmeal raisin cookies. One cookie, which is 1/36 of the batch, has 120 calories. There is nobody at my house who needs to eat cookies, but I thought I'd try the recipe.In the meantime, we opened it. Before making the cookies, I thought we could use some of it for everyday sweetening before making the cookies.  I stirred some into iced tea. Just like any teaspoon of cane sugar, it required extensive stirring to dissolve, and I found that I needed twice as much as half.Next I tried it in hot tea. In hot or cold tea, it tastes wonderful. It dissolves efficiently in hot tea. Soon I found myself drinking so much tea that I was consuming twice as much sugar as usual.  I love the taste of Sun Crystals!So did the other taste tester who shares tea in our office.  He drank cup after cup of delicious hot tea. Although the package says the product is suitable for diabetics, I doubted that it would help someone consume less sugar because the taste is addictive.When I decided to make the cookies, I discovered the bag was empty. I like this product, not because it helped me save calories - I don't think it did.  I know that it had many more calories than the no-calorie stevia which I normally use.

The key is BALANCE: flavored coffees should taste like coffee first, with the &#34;other&#34; flavor providing a highlight, not a shadow.I use the 8-oz setting on my Keurig K75 Platinum, and find that usually gives me the depth of flavor I like best.

When looking at the amount of sugar in a serving, bear in mind that the natural sugar here is not the same crap as the processed white sugar and corn syrup found in less healthy foods.  The flakes and dried fruit are distinct, and don't mix together in a single sugary flavor like sweetened kids' cereals often do.  However, at least in the box I got, the fruit was a little sparse.

Those who have trouble chewing and prefer a soft cereal probably won't like it.  The slightly powdery dried fruit is closer to what you find in other cereals of this nature.The rather substantial flakes make this cereal pretty filling, more so than you might think from looking at it (it lies somewhere between other flake & fruit types and granola), but the box is still pretty small.  Those who, like me, generally eat a large bowlful will go through a box in about three servings tops.

So, I usually brew it up a couple different ways to see how it will come out and adjust from there.First, I followed the instructions on the package and made a pot in a drip coffee maker.  This produced a strong coffee, but it was nasty!  The taste was like someone had dropped in an excessive amount of vanilla extract or sugar free vanilla flavoring.  Kind of like getting a vanilla latte in a tourist trap area.  The next pot, I backed off by reducing the grounds by two scoops and left the amount of water the same.  This produced a weaker but still good coffee taste with very mild hint of vanilla flavoring.  *Much better* in my opinion, and very palatable.  For the third pot, I went for iced coffee, cold brewing in a French press, using the original instructions. The product was very smooth and tasty.  Letting it sit in the fridge overnight after brewing enhanced the flavor.  Finally, I hot brewed it in the French press, again using the original mix ratio from the package.  Sadly, the taste again not so good, though not as bad as the first pot.In the end, I did find two brewing methods that I liked.

However, based on their recipes, and a normal amount a kid would eat, they might get 1/2 a serving of vegetables in the end. Which while better that nothing, amounts to not much more. 1 big carrot has more calories and nutritional value than 1 whole packet of these carrot blend ins.The mac and cheese recipe was pretty good, you can feel it adds a little bit of sweetness and thickness to the sauce, any kid that likes mac and cheese would most likely love it too, and don't really know what it had.

Seriously, kids seems to be hungry ALL THE TIME.  When I got the Baby Gourmet Juicy Pear and Garden Greens baby food, I figured it wouldn't be a bad snack for my kids.  Ingredients are fairly simple:  organic pear, organic broccoli, organic spinach, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), and organic lemon juice concentrate.  When I tried it, I have to admit that it's not bad.  The puree tastes like pear and broccoli - it's a little sweet, but not overly so.  The texture is like Mott's Applesauce (or any other applesauce without chunks).  I didn't like it enough to finish a pouch, but my preschoolers LOVED the stuff.  At 4.5 ounces per pouch, I can't imagine giving a full pouch to a 6 month old, but this is just the right size snack for a toddler or preschooler.  In fact, Trader Joes has applesauce in a similar pouch - my kids love those things, too.The pouches don't require refrigeration, so I just toss them into my bag and we can go out and have a quick and healthy snack while we're out.  The cap allows for the pouch to be resealed, just in case a pouch isn't finished in one sitting.  Baby Gourmet should really consider marketing this towards preschoolers - who can go wrong with convenient AND healthy that young kids like?  Recommended!

The crackers are fine, but the cheese paste tastes like a science experiment instead of real cheese.  I know you can't expect real cheese in a prepackaged, non-refrigerated snack like this one, but there's decent artificial cheese flavor and bad artificial cheese flavor, and this is definitely the latter.  (Also, the box reads ""Natural Flavors with Other Natural Flavors"", which is a pet peeve of mine - it sounds silly.  Just say ""Natural Flavors"" already!  It's like saying ""Rainy with a chance of showers"" in the weather report.)In terms of nutritional information, there's 7 grams of fat per serving, which is high, but 4.5 of those are unsaturated fats, which is more acceptable but still high. On the plus side, 5 grams of fiber per serving is great.The main draw of this product is the convenience of the packaging. Let's be honest: for the same amount of money, you can buy a box of crackers and some REAL cheddar cheese and have a much more natural, less processed, better tasting end result - but you'd have to keep the cheese refrigerated and put the snack together yourself, whereas you can just throw a couple of these pre-made and wrapped packages in your backpack and have a quick snack handy in case your toddler runs out of fuel when you're out and about. For a kid's snack, it's sure to be a hit, because it's convenient and not too unhealthy. I'd even consider buying it again for my 3 year old. But for adults, I'd have to think there are tastier and healthier ways to get cheese-on-a-cracker than this.Additional note: my wife adds that she actually liked the taste of the cheese. In her opinion, if you like the cheese that's in the other Ritz cheese-and-crackers products, it tastes exactly the same and you won't be disappointed.  I confess to not having a ton of experience with Ritz cheese spread, so maybe it's just that I'm a cheese snob :) So, second opinion from my better half: this isn't any worse than other Ritz crackers with cheese paste.

The ingredients list barley syrup, concentrated grape juice, molasses, honey, evaporated cane juice and brown sugar.  That's a lot of sugar.  I compared this cereal to other cereals in my pantry.  I converted all of them to the same number of grams per serving so my comparisons would be meaningful.  In nutritional value this cereal was close to Lucky Charms and Leaping Lemurs (an organic version of peanut butter Kix).  The Lucky Charms had more sugar and less fiber.

The flakes are very hard/crisp and very very sweet.  It made me think of eating a really hard frosted flake (with sugar added).  The fruit is freeze dried without any additional sugar so it is tart (but there is still sugar in the fruit, concentrated fructose).  I put soy milk on the cereal and let it sit for a minute and the flakes were still hard.  I tried rinsing some flakes in warm water to take some of the sweetness out, but that left warm, tasteless squishy flakes that were still sweet.If you like Very sweet cereal with a light malted barley taste, you'll like it.  Just remember that it full of sugar and the sugar/fiber ratio is not good.  If you are attracted to it because it says ""Natural"", remember that there are no regulations on the use of the word ""Natural"" in the food industry and the cereal does list any ingredients as organic.  I have to admit I did like the flavor and I liked the extreme crunch.  However, I threw away most of the box of cereal to keep from eating it because of the high sugar content.

My fridge has just about every Mae Ploy I could find at our local store. When I saw the Prima Rendang, I was anxious to try it, as I've made this before from recipes I found online.If I found a restaurant that served this, I would buy it, weekly. It's SO tasty, a nice fresh bright clean tasting curry, flavorful without tasting like it has too much salt or sugary sweetness. It tastes like I ground the spices and made the paste myself, it's THAT fresh. I have never made a curry this good at home before.PRO*Easy to make (see tips below) with a payout that is restaurant-quality. You could serve this to guests and they would want to marry you!*The sauce is generous enough that you could easily feed 4 people or a little more if you put in some extra veggies. I sliced up some green onions and I think peas would be good in it, or some grated radish or even a little potato if that's your thing.*Prep time is very fast*Everything you need for the sauce is in the box*All the spices and chilies are so perfectly balanced, you get a total experience of the curry and not just a few spices standing out more than others. It was honestly hard for me to pick out separate flavors, such was the harmonious balance. If I had to guess what spices were in it, that would be hard to do. Wonderful blend. They are listed on the box as: Chili, galangal, onion, shallot, pandan leaf, garlic, candlenut, ginger, lemon grass, fennel, coriander, cumin, kaffir lime leaf, cloves, turmeric, white pepper, cinnamon. I think they forgot to add ""crack"" into their list, I'm already jonesing for another bowl of this.CONS*The bits of leaves in the sauce kept interfering with my enjoyment of the dish. I know they are important to impart that fresh bright taste, but I felt like I was chewing my cud. It was like having bits of lawn clippings in my food and was annoying. I think this could be offset by using more veggies than I did.*The coconut powder can be lumpy and grainy, see tips belowCOOKING TIPS*The sauce thickens quickly and wants to stick to bottom of pan, I'd cook the meat to ALMOST done and then combine with the sauce.*Mix the coconut powder and water together, and then whisk in the paste. My coconut powder was lumpy as heck and left a grainy texture and bits in my gravy. Or, save the coconut powder for another use and just sub in a can of your favorite coconut milk. Eliminate or drastically reduce the water if you do this, try the can of coconut milk first and if you need more moisture add in a little water.*Use coconut oil to cook the meat in, it adds a nice flavor to the sauce.*this makes a LOT of food.

I purchased this for my friend since she does not want to go through the process of grinding. If grinding is an issue, then this is the next best option, only if it is from a reputable brand but rancid is a serious issue with all flax seeds regardless of the brand, regardless organic or conventional...OILS: Rancid is a process of mother nature and has nothing to do with organic, conventional, GMO or the type of seed since rancid has to do with oil. It is not important if the oil or the tablet is even frozen at the time of production till you consume since any seed, and I mean any type of seed regardless of the brand will go rancid once ground and cracked open since the shell, the protection is removed which will allow air and moisture access the oil of the seed much quicker than when the seed is in a complete un-hulled form. The best example of rancidity is brown rice. Place some brown rice in freezer and you will notice in few months it will not even cook since the oils have gone rancid even if it was kept in a sealed container in the freezer regardless. Chia is the only seed that does not need to be ground in order for human body to digest and get the nutrients and can be stored for longer time than any other seed without going rancid. Sesame seed, flax seed, etc. are so dense that will pass through human body when not ground making it absolutely worthless since human body can not digest it in its natural form.FIBER: Fiber is essential for body since fiber absorbs the unwanted liquid in the gut and body has to defecate that blown up fiber which in return lowers cholesterol, glucose, blood pressure, etc. and brings comfort and efficiency to human body unlike fat which stays in human body unless needed for energy. Flax is high in fiber.MINERALS: Flax is one of the kings of nutrients when it comes to minerals and so important to me as a whole delicious seed; highest ALA, high magnesium, high potassium, calcium with the healthiest fat.Accordingly for 100gr servings size of;SESAME__FLAX__CHIA__AMARANTH__QUINOA__HEMP__PISTACHIO__ALMOND__CASHEW__PEANUTCALORIES565__534__490__371__368__567__557__575__553__585SAT FAT34__18__16__7__4__17__27__19__39__34CALCIUM99__26__63__16__5__0__11__26__4__5MAGNESIUM89__98__0__62__49__167__30__67__73__44POTASSIUM14__23__5__15__16__167__29__20__19__19ZINC48__29__23__19__21__83__15__21__39__22FIBER47__109__151__8__11__4 __41__49__13__32PHYTOSTEROLS714__0__0__0__0__N/A__214__0__0__0FRESHNESS: Fresh means nutritious and delicious. I consume lots of seeds, beans, grains, vegetables, etc. and freshness is a priority regardless of the brand so I always purchase my food ingredients in small quantities from reputable sellers with high turnover. When fresh, food is nutritious and that goes for any food in any form, from frozen to canned. Fresh food is nutritious as well as delicious since nutrients give food its delicious taste. When old or rancid, nutrients are gone and any food item becomes an empty calories with no taste and absolutely worthless regardless of the brand or price, organic or conventional. For few years I consumed seeds in oil form since physicians advised me to do so not knowing that majority are not aware that seeds hardly offer any nutrients unless; seeds are fresh, not old which means rancid, not in oil form, not in supplement form, not hulled, ground and consumed within few days, kept in dark cold temperatures, away from light-sun-moisture since the oil in seeds and nuts go rancid regardless. That is why brown rice which has its nutrients will go rancid even if kept in freezer while white rice will last for years at room temperature since it hardly has any nutrients or oil. I ground in my coffee grinder sesame, flax, chia, amaranth, hemp then add cocoa, isolate protein, soy milk and consume it before my workouts on daily basis for its vitamins, minerals, protein and many nutrients, without much spike in my glucose. Un-hulled seeds are full of nutrients. I never consume hulled seeds which are empty calories, absolutely worthless since the nutrients have been removed.OMEGA-3: You will never see ALA on any fish you purchase. Infact you will never see ALA on any fish oil supplement either, you will only see EPA and DHA. ALA is not the same as EPA or DHA. That is true for any brand of flaxseed regardless if such flaxseed oil is in solid form, oil form in a bottle or in a capsule form. Greens, veges, nuts, seeds and fruits do not offer any Omega-3 in form of EPA/DHA since omega-3 EPA/DHA is an animal source. There are two major types of omega-3 fatty acids in our diets: One type is alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which is found in plants the other type, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is found in fatty fish. The body partially converts ALA to EPA and DHA. There is no proof what percent of ALA gets converted by human body to EPA or DHA. You can consume all ALAs that you want and depending to your genes it may never turn any into omega-3. Blood test is the only way to see the affects. I get omega 3 from sardines although flaxseed is an important part of my diet since flaxseed offers so many nutrients. Flaxseed offers more ALA than chia for $1.99 a pound not $15 a pound, 22.8gr vs. 17.8gr. ANSWERNOTFOUND",next best option,"(161, 177)",1,0.15,False

Okay, what exactly is amaranth and quinoa?  I've ridden a camel, been to a state fair and even penetrated Japanese prime ministerial security, but I can't say that I know what this stuff is.From the product page, it appears that the clusters are supposed to be little bite-size globs of vanilla blueberry goodness.  Unfortunately, when mine arrived in the Amazon.com book mailer, I only had two little cluster-like bits.  The rest was smashed and separated into bird seed.  I figure that clusters of this stuff would be pretty good, and make it a lot easier to eat this stuff ""on-the-go!"" as the package copy boldly exhorts.To its credit, the package opened right away, with the first pull, right along the top edge.  You'd be surprised how many packages can't get this right, like tortillas, beef jerky and lunch meat.  So, they had an advantage already.First came the sniff test: how does this stuff smell?  In general, it's kind of an industrial-neutral.  There is no cloying smell of artificial blueberry, which I was relieved not to smell.  There is the distinct and powerful scent of nothing but grain and seed, not salty or spicy, nor sugary sweet.  So far, the ingredients were in step with the package's copy.  There seemed to be just a hint of factory chemicals for the purposes of crunch or freshness or whatever.  I'm not saying that this is in the product, just that I seemed to discern that smell.So, I tried a third of this package in on-the-go mode, right out of the package.  Good stuff.  This would be a great product to bring along on a hike or a campout.  But, the bag's small size would make it awfully hard to share with any more than just a couple of people.  The taste was great, with very clear natural sweetness.  Very crunchy, but not that unpleasant brittle crunchiness you get with some foods.I then tried a third of the package in a little bit of milk, and it was just as good.  It stayed very crunchy for a good long time, all the way through eating it.  The density of it caused most of the product to sink to the bottom, so I had to bottom-feed with my spoon to get it all.Then I put the remaining third into some milk again, and sprinkled some Equal over the top.  Yeah, it was considerably sweeter, maybe even a little too much so.  Recommendation: do not sweeten this product any further.  Real sugar would make this stuff way too sweet.Taste.  The taste is in keeping with the smell, very grainy.  The taste of the blueberries is very subtle, as is the vanilla.  I could taste both, but it was subdued.  Overall, the taste was quite good.  Good texture, too.Nutrition.  Man, you're getting a lot of fiber here.  And there is a lot that this product doesn't have, as the package's front makes clear, like saturated fat, trans fats, cholesterol, etc.  That's pretty good.  But you're also not getting a lot of calcium, iron, or any Vitamin A or C.  While the package's front says there are no ""refined sugars"" in the product, the listed ingredients include official stand-ins/euphemisms for ""sugar,"" like evaporated cane juice.  The product's serving size is a miniscule 1/3 of a cup, and this comes in at 120 calories.  So, a single package, which I ate for dinner, comes in at close to 1300 calories.  Great energy food, but not great for a Saturday morning cereal bender in front of the Cartoon Network.Price.  The unit price comes out to be more than $5/bag.  That's something like more than a dollar more than a big box of cereal (truth be told, the big boxes come out to about 13 oz, and this product comes in at 11 oz).  So, you'll get considerably more product for your money with regular boxed cereal.Bottom line: This is a good product, and I enjoyed it.  The taste and texture is good.

It's probably been about 25 years since I've had that particular pleasure, so when the opportunity arose to try these 'fancy' graham crackers I took advantage.Nabisco grahams are practically coated in a layer of cinnamon and sugar, leaving a pleasant residue on your fingers. In contrast these Back to Nature crackers have no visible spice on the surface though they do have a smattering of whole grains on the surface, ostensibly to give it that ""old world wholesome"" appearance. Although there's no spice on the surface the scent of apples and cinnamon is pleasant and clean.Oddly, although the smell of apples and cinnamon is quite strong out of the box, the apple cinnamon flavor is comparatively weak. That's not to say the flavor is too weak, only that it's weaker than I thought it would be based on how nice they smell.From a texture perspective these grahams are lighter and airier than Nabisco's offerings. Whereas a Nabisco graham has a bite sort of like the chocolate part of an Oreo cookie, these grahams have a softer and crisper bite more like a Ritz cracker. As such they tend to crumble more easily and, when dunked in milk, they tend to fall apart very quickly.So overall these are a pleasant tasting, light, reasonably wholesome treat that would go great with tea and maybe a little apple jam. I don't know that they'd ever be as much of a childhood favorite as the ol' Nabiscos, but I can see them being a more ""evolved"" graham for more grown-up tastes.

I prefer cream in my coffee, so I was hesitant to taste it as it was. But I tasted it and found it to have a nice medium coffee strength with a bit of sweetness to it. In my everyday coffee I don't add sugar, but on occasion it's nice to have a special coffee drink, and since it's been hot here lately, I had poured it over ice as well. I added cream and found it to be quite enjoyable. It's one of those conveniences that one could easily become addicted to.Next I tried the Cappuccino which had a similar taste and flavor as the Caffe, but was milder. I prefer my coffee stronger, so my preference was for the Caffe and still I would have liked it stronger (perhaps this is offered in another version). But the Cappuccino was also good and I had poured it over ice as well. I was concerned about both coffees being packaged in cans as I don't like my drinks to have a metallic tinge to them, but I did not notice anything out of the ordinary. I had, however, poured the drinks over ice into a glass, so that may have helped. Regardless, it was really nice to have sitting out on my deck on a warm day. Hot coffee just does not sit well with me in hot weather.All-in-all, if you're looking for a mild, sweet coffee drink that's quick and easy to take with you on the go or to pour into a glass at home, this is a good choice.

For 70% fruit juice I was expecting something that stayed more true to the fruit that was one the front of the can not a mixture of an asortment of different juices.The small cans are perfect for putting in a backpack, cooler etc. and at 90 calories they are relatively healthy as well.All in all, it's not a bad product and I can easily see where others may really like the flavors.

The sauce is smooth, has some sharpness to it, but is not overly spicy. After the cucumber experiment, I placed the opened bottle in the refrigerator. I will try it again as a salad dressing when the tomatoes in the garden turn red, Right now they are still green. They will probably turn all at once, so I will have to figure out ways to consume them.My impression of the Taco Bell sauce after refrigeration was that it has almost the same consistency as mayonnaise, This gave me another idea. I usually make tuna salad by mixing mayonnaise, hot sauce, and a few spices into the tuna. This time I mixed in only the Taco Bell sauce. Incidentally, the sauce has half the calories per tablespoon compared to the mayonnaise. The tuna salad turned out well. It was very similar to my mayonnaise-based version.I was pleasantly surprised by my initial experiments with the sauce. I have tried both the Chipotle and Jalapeno versions. They both work equally well. That is, I find it hard to tell the differences in taste. The one negative is that they contain artificial coloring and flavoring. They lose a star on that account.

I followed the instructions on the package - 1 rounded tablespoon for each 6 ounce cup of coffee. I found the same taste results with both methods. I like a good cup of black coffee but am not fanatical about it. I do grind fresh bold or medium body beans each morning and use filtered water to prepare the pot.As someone who usually adds a little espresso or instant espresso powder to most chocolate recipes I know this flavor combination is a wonderful marriage. Depending on the percentage of espresso to chocolate, the result is either a deep mocha flavor with the coffee playing a major role, or a small addition will result in complex chocolate flavor with no obvious coffee component.  Unfortunately, with the Gevalia Dark Chocolate Truffle coffee the merger of coffee and chocolate adversely affected both the coffee and the chocolate flavor.There is a definite aftertaste from the artificial flavor, and the coffee itself is bitter and acidic. I do not know if the artificial flavor affected the coffee or the coffee is bitter and acidic on its own but, after each sip I had an involuntary puckering reaction, not my lips, but the inside of my cheeks as if I was consuming something containing acetic acid, like vinegar, not that it tasted like vinegar - it didn't.  The flavor was remarkably unpleasant, and when the cup cooled off, it tasted worse. Even the aroma while brewing smelled artificial.The other reviewers who mention how greatly improved the flavor became once cream was added is an indication of a consistent problem.  I love the taste of coffee and like it unadorned - no cream or sugar. I only add cream if I am in a restaurant and the coffee doesn't taste good. I use the cream to doctor-it-up in hopes of salvaging some of the flavor and masking the poor aspects whether caused by bitterness or coffee that's been sitting in the pot too long.  This coffee is no exception, the cream vastly improved the drinkability, but the action is akin to smearing butter on a day old roll. Underneath it is still a stale roll, and although the butter tastes delicious, it would not be accurate to call the combination a buttery delight.On the positive side, flavored coffees are usually light body and the Gevalia is definitely medium body. The packaging is quite attractive and the name is clever, but in the end may work against the product because Dark Chocolate Truffle evokes a clear taste profile for most people and the coffee doesn't live up to the name. I am rating the coffee three stars instead of less because if the purchaser always uses cream in their coffee, many of the taste issues I encountered should be if not resolved, at least mitigated.

I try to make a point of buying these local brands for the simple fact that the money stays in Louisiana and both of them taste very good.  To me, Starbucks has always been an overpriced and overhyped brand with a brilliant marketing strategy that put them on the map.  Still, I sometimes visit the local Starbucks for a frappucino or even an Earl Grey latte when I have a bit of extra spending money on hand.I picked up Starbucks' Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored, via the Vine program.  I have to admit that it's a very good coffee as far as flavored coffees go.  The scent of the vanilla intertwined with the coffee hits you before you even open the bag, but do not use that as a device of judgement until after you've brewed a few cups of this coffee.As I've already said, the smell of vanilla is strong, but the actual vanilla flavor is very slight.  In fact, the vanilla is very hard to taste at all.I decided to brew this coffee in two separate ways:  1) Per the instructions on the bag (two tablespoons per six ounces of water) and 2) By my normal method (three tablespoons per six ounces of water).After brewing the coffee, I drank each brewed cup in three different ways:  1) black (which is my normal method of drinking coffee), 2) with one teaspoon of cream and one teaspoon of sugar, and 3) with two teaspoons of cream and two teaspoons of sugar.What I immediately noticed was that the bag's brewing instructions suited my personal taste best.  My normal brewing method made the coffee stronger (as I like it), but didn't alter the taste at all.When I drank the coffee black in both brewing cases, I noticed almost no difference in the taste, although the coffee's body was a bit heavier in the second brewing method.  The vanilla flavor was miniscule.With one teaspoon of cream and one teaspoon of sugar, I found that the vanilla flavor stood out a bit more, but was still fairly weak.  The overall taste of the coffee was good, though.With two teaspoons of cream and sugar, the vanilla came into its own a bit more, but could not overtake the coffee's taste itself.Overall, this is a coffee drinker's flavored coffee.  If you want a fuller, sweeter vanilla taste and less coffee taste, look elsewhere.  If you only drink flavored coffees as a treat but prefer the taste of medium to dark roast coffee alone, this brew will be right up your alley.I personally enjoyed this coffee, and plan to buy more of it soon.

If you're into granola bars, these will be a little bit of a departure as you really don't get that kind of consistency.  These are also nuttier, and overall seem to be more akin to a nut-based candy bar like a Payday.As far as the pluses go, the bars have a nice balance of sweet and salty, and though the consistency doesn't scream granola bar, it's just chewy enough that it also doesn't scream peanut bar (like the various brands of peanut brittle-esqe bars you tend to find in vending machines.)  The peanut butter coating on the bottom also has a nice consistency and taste, not chalky or too sweet like peanut butter tends to get in products like this.  Also, at 46 grams, it's pretty satisfying, and I'd think it would certainly make for a decent small meal on the go if you're in a pinch.There are some drawbacks though.  Mainly the bars can get a little messy where the peanut butter is concerned, so I can imagine it would be a nightmare with kids.  The bars are also pretty high in fat, which isn't as much surprising (they are peanut based), as it is unfortunate.

The combination of blueberry and vanilla was extremely appealing to me, so I decided to give it a try, in a cereal bowl with milk.  Let's start with the positive things about the granola, since there is much to like.  The product is gluten free, has 750 mg of Omega-3s, there are no refined sugars, no saturated fat (there are 3 grams of fat total in a 1/3 cup serving), no trans fat, 5 grams of fiber, and has very low sodium.  The sweeteners include evaporated cane juice, molasses, blueberry puree, apple puree, plum puree and apple juice.  In essence, it should be the perfect snack.  Unfortunately, it was not.  There was a very mild hint of vanilla flavoring and almost no distinguishable taste of blueberry to be found.  In fact, the granola lacked any kind of flavor at all.  And the granola clusters themselves lacked freshness and tasted quite stale.  The overwhelming smell when you open the bag is definitely flax, and not the formerly mentioned blueberry and vanilla that was advertised.  So what I had hoped would be a new favorite granola cereal ended up being a bit disappointing.  I wish that the flavor itself could have been better, because the ingredients are just so good for you.  I will more than likely eat some more of this, perhaps in yogurt to ease the crunchiness and stale taste a bit, but I will not be buying the product again.

Many people are indulging in a gluten free lifestyle, some out of necessity and some out of curiosity.  I have friends who do this, and while some of the gluten free products available are palatable, I have found that more often than not they are off putting.  I was excited to see if this `care package' contained any pleasant surprises, but overall it just reaffirmed by previous belief; that gluten free is not for me.Let's take these one at a time.Blueberry Pomegranate Trail Mix Crunch:Flavor-wise, this is pretty good.  There isn't much in the package though, and the clusters are rather large.  They are also very sticky and leave a residue on your fingers.  Like I said, they tasted good (not very strong in the pomegranate flavor, but very nutty and blueberry tasting) but they also had a strong resemblance to `healthy cereal', so keep that in mind before purchasing.Multi-Seed Crackers:Crunchy and satisfying; these crackers taste slightly `healthy' but they also have some interesting flavors that give it a distinct and memorable taste.  I had to get used to them, but after a few bites I was hooked.Steak Nuggets + Cheese:This box contains a little meal.  The beef steak nuggets are a bit like jerky but they have a bland aftertaste.  They are chewy, but predictably so; despite the promise that they are `more tender'.  The Multi-Seed crackers are the same already provided in a larger bag.  When you lather on the Parmesan Peppercorn cheese spread, it takes those crackers to another level.  It's a great flavor, but I will say that it is a tad runny as apposed to creamy.  I'm kind of obsessed with ginger in general, so this Ginger Zip fruit and nut mix is phenomenally good.  I know that seems a tad excessive, but you can't go wrong with banana, cranberries and GINGERED PEANUTS!  Oh, and to finish off the `meal', you have an Almond Roca, which is always delicious.Sheffa Zesty Snack Mix:I was really excited about this.  The mix on the cover of the package looks amazing.  I've had chickpea fries before and I loved them.  Roasted corn and toasted seeds sounded like the perfect way to round out the snack.  Opening the package and peering inside I was turned off completely.  It looked like animal food.  The chickpea noodles are about five times smaller than they appear on the cover.  The taste is also extremely bland and almost too earthy.  It was kind of like chewing on twigs.  I think I've said enough about this one.Popchips, Barbeque Potato:Now these are kind of great.  They have a great airy texture that sits well on the tongue.  The flavor is strong on the outset, but one thing that is a slight detractor is that the flavor does dissipate quickly.  So, yes; the chips aren't perfect, but they are uniquely inviting, and that airy consistency really makes for a light and tangy snack.Sharkies, Watermelon Scream:There is an artificial flavor here that I'm not a gigantic fan of.  It kind of tastes like sugar substitute; a cloyingly sweet aftertaste.  That said, there is a lot of flavor here.  It is a robust flavor, so it has that going for it.  If you don't mind that faux-sugar taste then you should really enjoy these.  I could definitely taste the watermelon, which is nice (I love the flavor).Wild Garden Hummus:On its own, this garbanzo bean dip is a tad too; sweet?  I think that's the sensation I'm getting from this.  It just seems off.  It actually has an almost sour tang to it, like something that has gone bad.  But, when lathered onto one of those multi-seed crackers it is actually masked enough by the earthiness of the cracker to give off a pleasantly balanced bean flavor.Emergen-C Raspberry Fizzy Drink Mix:I love the taste of raspberries, but I have to tell you that I have a strong aversion to these types of drinks.  They always taste chalky and artificial to me and this one really isn't an exception to that rule.  It is void of much flavor, but it certainly smacks the back of your throat with that sweetened fizz.In the end, I can't recommend this to anyone who doesn't need to cut gluten out of their diet.  It just isn't worth it.  But, if you need to find gluten free alternatives to foods you love, then this may be something you'll enjoy.  The Popchips and the crackers are pretty good, and those gingered peanuts are still calling my name. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(4365, 4379)",5,0.0,False

He points out that the San Francisco Bay Coffee supports many environmental projects, as noted on the top of the box, which also shows photos of these worthy projects.

I wouldn't think these would be for someone with a casual liking of ginger, but for those who enjoy it more, these are sure to please as far as flavor goes. As for the crunch, these are a hard cookie and not for those with gentle teeth, but they are, after all, a ginger snap. Ginger snaps are not known to be soft in any way, shape, or form. Rest assured that these won't break in shipment. My bag of cookies survived their journey even though they came in a soft envelope, which in turn was crammed into my cluster mailbox. However, when I opened the bag, I only found two broken pieces equaling a cookie. That's one tough cookie!As far as nutrition goes, it's pretty good: 5 cookies in a serving, 130 calories (30 from fat), saturated fat 1.5 grams, sugar is 12 grams (not great but it is a cookie so far better than most other choices).

When I got this sampler box in the mail I tried them immediately and have some thoughts about them.First, they come off tasting like weak soup in a lot of ways. The flavors are very muted, as one might expect. I discovered that if I boiled the bags in water for 10 minutes rather than steep them as tea in a cup, the flavors are considerably improved and strengthened. Each bag contains either decaf green tea or decaf black tea, but I didn't taste tea flavors in anything I brewed.Dieters might well like how this tea feels a bit more like a foodstuff than tea normally does. At 5 calories per steeped cup of tea, it's a very light snack at best, but with whole-grain crackers and perhaps a bit of cheese, it'd feel like a decent lunch. I can't imagine drinking a cup of this tea by itself and feeling sated. The cup I tried was drunk at midday with no breakfast in my stomach yet, and it definitely didn't curb any hunger pangs. Middle-aged and Boomer dieters familiar with powdered bouillon packets in hot water will find these a considerably upmarket and modernized version of the old Herb-Ox standby. Once you get past the ""weak soup"" feeling, the flavors are light and bright. The Tomato Mint soup in particular functioned well as a drink.These do make wonderful poaching liquids for soups. I just got finished with an egg-noodle soup made with the Spinach Chive tea and thought it was delicious. I boiled the teabag in the water for 10 minutes, then stirred in the noodles to cook. I couldn't taste much of spinach or chives, but the broth was quite good at any rate. It's a pity they have actual tea leaves in them, or I'd have just ripped the bags open to use as seasoning for the food. I loved the complexity of flavor they produced when boiled that way and used as part of a meal. It's an off-label use, but one I recommend wholeheartedly.I can't see myself buying these except for cooking purposes--which may well happen as I did like the broth made from them--but dieters may well find them useful as actual tea to drink. I would recommend that anybody using these boil the bags rather than steep them to get the full flavor from them. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2220, 2234)",2,0.0,False

It's green tea with lemongrass, lemon balm and verbena leaves.  Now, that's not to say it's bad.  It's green tea with a little kick to it, an added set of flavors that blend well.

Since these ingredients are the main ones also in this Lipton tea, I figured it had to be very similar in taste (although I don't add ""natural flavor"" to mine, so I thought maybe Lipton will have some amazing flavor that mine doesn't thanks to their access to food flavoring labs and ingredients I don't have.)I brewed a cup of this tea and my mug was a little on the large side so I used two bags and let it steep until it was somewhere between still hot and just lukewarm. The bags smell pretty good in the box, but even with two bags this tea was pretty weak and I thought it lacked flavor. I really wanted to like it but I think I will definitely stick with the hassle of making my own - for more flavor, for organic ingredients and for economics. I would suggest not using more than six ounces of water per one of these teabags. The tiniest bit of sugar or honey may help bring out the flavor in this tea if you do happen to have a box of it.

I am familiar with cacao percentages and usually prefer my dark chocolate in the 60-ish percent range, though I will eat up to 70 percent occasionally, and this confirmed my belief that more isn't necessarily better when it comes to chocolate percentages.This chocolate clocks in between a bittersweet of 70 and unsweetened at 99, so it was really hard to know what to do with it. I tasted it straight from the bar, and it is very, very dark with hardly any sweetness at all. It was bitter but not overly harsh. It's obviously good quality chocolate so I can't fault them for that, I simply prefer something a little sweeter. I can't see myself craving a piece of this to eat. I don't even think I would eat it for health purposes.I went to Scharffen Berger's website to see if there were any recipes for this chocolate, but all I could find was one for lace sandwich cookies (with the chocolate in the middle) and a pecan tart. They did suggest pairing this chocolate with marshmallow to make s'mores, so that is what I did. The chocolate melts beautifully and had a smooth taste that went well with the sweet marshmallows and graham crackers, but honestly I still think I prefer a lower percentage chocolate.So, if you are a big fan of ""more is better"" when it comes to chocolate percentages, and like your chocolate on the extra dark and bitter side, this is a fine choice. But if, like me, you prefer a slightly more sweet taste without compromising the richness of a bittersweet flavor, you might do better off trying one of their lower percentage chocolates like the 70 or 62%.

The almonds are crunchy and roasted to perfection, with few or no overdone brown interiors.Diabetics and others who watch their sugar intake will be pleased to learn that this snack contains only 1 gram of sugar per 1/4 cup serving because of the addition of sucralose, an artificial sweeteners better known commercially as Splenda.  Dieters, however, will want to be careful with the 13 grams of fat in that same size serving.In general, I like Emerald nut products, but this one disappointed me, mostly because I found the chocolate flavor lacking and because I try to avoid artificial sweeteners.

The flakes are VERY hard, though...some might call it ""crunchy,"" but to me, it was unusual to have a flake that was resistant to being chewed!

It came pretty fast, in a semi-liquid state but not leaking; rather well packaged. I let it melt completely in a warm room (CO melts at about 80 deg F) and then put it in the fridge to let it solidify. One of the reasons I did (and always do) that is to smooth out the texture: as is, every type of CO I've tried comes in like a bunch of white fibers stuck in more even liquid, but if you thaw it completely and then freeze, it becomes all evenly semi-transparent, like one thick candle sort of thing. It probably doesn't matter; just a personal quirk, I guess.Anyway, this is good stuff: the taste is nice -- very good for sweetich things like carrots or plums, for example (I always have a bowl of very lightly steamed carrots around, and I snack on them, taking one and dipping it into CO, which is good for two reasons: first, it tastes great, and second, carotene is fat-soluble so you need to combine carrots with some sort of fat or it won't be used by the body well).All in all, there isn't much to say -- CO is CO is CO; this kind is no different from other types I've tried. CO in general is shamelessly hyped as a sort of panacea from every health problem known to man; this is mostly lies, but two things are true: it is tasty, and it's good for skin/hair (I've tried both, and it's true, it works). Don't believe anything else and don't ""take"" it daily as if it were a medicine: it's pure saturated fat and that's the end of it: it will raise your cholesterol as any other kind of saturated fat. As far as its being a weight-loss agent, this is not a complete lie, but remember, it works only if you _substitute_ CO for other kinds of saturated fats (that means quit eating butter, meat, etc.) If, otoh, you simply _add_ it to your normal diet, you're not gonna lose any weight -- instead, you're gonna gain weight at least as good as you would otherwise + increase your cholesterol. But if you decide to substitute, do not think it's an easy choice: CO is pure saturated fat, whereas other sources of saturated fats (butter, meat, etc.) come with a lot of nutritional goodness like vitamins, proteins, and the like -- things that CO is wholly devoid of. So my suggestion, for what it's worth (not much, I know) is to use CO just as another agreeable food to be used in moderation, not a magic medicine. I read somewhere that a 40-sh male in good health on a 2000 cal/day diet can get 200 calories from saturated fats w/o harming himself.One other thing I wanted to mention: the jar says it's ""pure extra virgin"" -- keep in mind that ""extra virgin"" is meaningful only when applied to olive oil. That is because there are specific and stringent industry standards stipulating what constitutes ""virgin"", ""extra virgin"", etc. There are no such standards about any other oils, so saying your CO is ""extra virgin"" communicates zero useful information and is no more than disingenuous hand-waving. It's like Nutiva says on their jars ""no cholesterol!"". No kidding, it's like wood-free nails. Of course plant-derived foods have no cholesterol, but BS rules in this industry, so just be aware of what's what and smart enough to dismiss useless hype like claims of a CO being ""extra virgin"".OK, there's really no more to say: as long as you use this tasty substance rationally, it's good stuff, so bottomline is: recommended -- except for one thing: just as I was deciding it's time to post a review and navigating to this page, I noticed that the price went up by the mind-blowing 60 percent since, not just since I bought it (two weeks ago), but literally within the last few days. Does my salary go up 60 percent in a couple of days? No. So, while the product is good and I can't give it less than five stars, I will suggest you do not reward naked greed and at least try to find better-priced alternatives. Especially in this economic environment that we have right now. The current price here is even higher than it is in Wegman's (brick-and-mortar grocery store; they carry it, but it's more than the seven bucks I bought it for here).PS. Btw, I see now someone reports that this oil comes in a glass jar: this is a bare-faced lie. The jar is transparent plastic, quite soft actually, so you can't _honestly_ mistake it for glass. Be extremely suspicious about these massive five-star reviews (here and elsewhere); I for a long time have a feeling those are posted by manufacturers' employees to create hype (and why not? Amazon does nothing to guard against fake reviews; all one needs to do in order to start posting reviews (real OR fake) is buy something once from this site). Some reviews read like the reviewer hasn't actually seen the product in question and is interested only in adding another five-star rating, not the review.PPS. Thanks to commenters Lulu and Adriana for additional info and helpful suggestions.PPPS. Trader Joe's sells CO for 5.99 for 16-oz jar. It's slightly more bland than this one, but plenty good but if you use it for cooking or skin. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(5090, 5104)",1,0.0,False

The 100% juice also accounts for the strong aftertaste.Finally, natural sugar is still sugar, and has just as many calories.

The combination of blueberry and vanilla was extremely appealing to me, so I decided to give it a try, in a cereal bowl with milk.

The product is gluten free, has 750 mg of Omega-3s, there are no refined sugars, no saturated fat (there are 3 grams of fat total in a 1/3 cup serving), no trans fat, 5 grams of fiber, and has very low sodium.  The sweeteners include evaporated cane juice, molasses, blueberry puree, apple puree, plum puree and apple juice.  In essence, it should be the perfect snack.  Unfortunately, it was not.  There was a very mild hint of vanilla flavoring and almost no distinguishable taste of blueberry to be found.  In fact, the granola lacked any kind of flavor at all.  And the granola clusters themselves lacked freshness and tasted quite stale.  The overwhelming smell when you open the bag is definitely flax, and not the formerly mentioned blueberry and vanilla that was advertised.  So what I had hoped would be a new favorite granola cereal ended up being a bit disappointing.  I wish that the flavor itself could have been better, because the ingredients are just so good for you.  I will more than likely eat some more of this, perhaps in yogurt to ease the crunchiness and stale taste a bit, but I will not be buying the product again.

Kenyan, Ethiopian, Rwandan, Tanzanian, and Ugandan have become, and remain, favorites...and are always very special amongst my ""go-to"" coffees.~~I know this is getting long here, and hope I have not lost you yet as I will bring this to a close here shortly.~~After having said all I have above, I cut to the chase, here, for this (Brown Gold) Ethiopian coffee....This is not a review mentioning ""essence of this"" or ""overtones of that"", etc.! ~It is SIMPLE. This is robust, full-flavored, dark and rich coffee...satisfying to those seeking a full bodied, dark brew. This coffee (offered here as ""K-cups"" for this brew-type machine) are not wimpily packed...they stand up to a Full 8 oz brew setting without losing any of the richness one would wish for and desire. I have pot brewed most of my life, and found these containers suprisingly capable of delivering a first rate quality cup of coffee...most impressed here with this!Straight forward, straight up, this coffee has been increasingly familiar in my pantry for some time now, of late, and with the selection as a Vine trial of these packets, I offer this review and hope it may help you or convivce you to try Brown Gold Ethiopian. It is a great favorite that I love recommending to others, and serving and sharing with my friends and guests.~operabruin ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2709, 2723)",1,0.0,False

The bags smell pretty good in the box, but even with two bags this tea was pretty weak and I thought it lacked flavor.

The mango used is the fragrant green and red Central and South American Mango rather than the intensely sweet South Asian Mango.  The sauce is semi-thick and seems to contain a lot of fruit.  There are no arificial ingredients listed on the label.The predominant taste is a sweet honey, then the clean fragrant mango, then a mild hint of Habanero follows.  It is not hot as you would expect from a Habanero sauce. It would be too mild for a hot sauce afficiando, but still too spicy for a novice.  Out of 10 (1 being not hot & 10 being sucicide) this would rank a 2 staright out of the bottle, as the sweetness takes the edge off.  If this sauce were to be used in cooking (heat from cooking increases the hotness of chillies) then this would move up to a 3.5We used this sauce as a glaze over pork kebabs, as a dipping sauce for breaded chicken strips, and to make a sauce base for sauteed shrimp. The flank steak overpowered the clean taste of the sauce and so we added garlic, a half teaspoon of soy sauce and fresh chillies to ""beef up"" the sauce. This gave it a slightly Hawaiian twist.Overall a very versatile sauce than can be easily diluted/strengthened and used in many dishes.  It is worth a try and would make a nice BBQ hostess gift.UPDATE Sept 27, 2009:Over the past few months this has become one of my favourite glazes to use on grilled food.

Second, I LOVE chocolate and caramel--especially when combined together!  Third, I thought it would be fun to lampoon a research project for this review.With this knowledge in mind, I decided to take my bag of Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates out to the Veterans Administration (VA) Hospital were I am a volunteer with the VA's diet and healthy lifestyle program, MOVE! (please go to [...] for information).  I did this for several reasons: 1) I knew that my personal prejudice might result in a skewed review; 2) at 290 pounds, I need to eat a whole bag of chocolates like I need another hole in my head; 3) I truly wanted to share the surprising bounty of getting a bag of Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates with others; and, 4) as an experienced researcher, I could not pass up the opportunity to do a little ""research.""  Please let me make if perfectly clear that I fully acknowledge that this is NOT A SCIENTIFIC STUDY, which is why I surreptitiously entitled my review ""A 'Semi-Scientific' Survey....""  This is simply a fun way to share the wealth and get the opinions of others.  In this vein I will explain the ""methodological procedures"" I followed, as if this was a real survey.SAMPLE:  I offered a piece of Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates to a total of thirty people, seven of whom did not take a piece.  All seven were VA personnel, one of which was allergic to chocolate.  The others stated that they either did not like candy (including chocolate) or, after reading the nutritional label, stated the caramel chocolates were ""way too fattening for me.""  There are four registered nutritionists (several with Masters degrees) in the Nutrition Department at Fort Harrison VA, Montana, where I volunteer.  Besides them and myself, there is a part-time staff worker, a physical therapist (with a Doctorate), a veteran CWT worker, and one other volunteer working with the MOVE! program, all of whom took part.  In addition to these eight individuals, I gave a piece of Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates to four other VA employees and eleven randomly selected veterans/family members, for a total sample of twenty three people (not including myself--the 24th piece).  Out of this sample five stated that they did not really like chocolate and/or caramel very much (but were willing to sample the piece I offered them).  Three others, like myself, stated that they ""loved chocolate and caramel together.""TECHNIQUES: To collect my ""data,"" I cut each of the 12 pieces in half, and offered this sample piece of Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates to people at the VA, and asked them to tell me what they thought of the candy, recording their comments in my personal shorthand notes.  I then categorized each person into one of four categories that emerged from their comments: 1) liked the candy; 2) liked the candy, but...; 3) did not like the candy, but...; and 4) did not like the candy.  I have not bothered to do any data analysis.RESULTS:  Based upon the above categories, the numbers are as follows:Liked Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates:  17Liked Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates, but...  3Did not like Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates, but...  1Did not like Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates  2A few examples of comments made by those who liked the chocolates were: ""Very, very, very Good.  Delicious.  Smooth and rich.  And the smell is absolutely great!""  ""Loved it!  Really, really good.""  ""I like it!  The taste, the texture are great.""The two who liked the chocolate, but had reservations, commented:""Wonderful!  Very Good...It smells so wonderful.  Delicious, but one serving is half the recommended daily fat intake, and this one piece means I can't have any more fat today, as it is all my diet allows.""  ""They're good; better than their regular candy.  But it is too rich for me.""The one person who did not like the caramel chocolate, but had other thoughts stated: ""OK--especially if you like rich chocolate--but it is loaded with fat and just isn't tasty enough to compensate for all the fat in just one piece, let alone several.""The two who did not like the Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates had this to say:""Chocolate and caramel are my two favorite candy flavors, and they smell delicious.  Yet, while they taste creamy, they have a noticeable waxy texture and taste that overrides the initial taste and flavor.  Overall, I am sad to say I don't like them, nor would I ever buy them now that I have tried them.""  ""No. I do not like it.  Way too buttery, fatty, and waxy tasting for me.""CONCLUSIONS:  Overall, approximately 80% of those who chose to try a piece of Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates liked them.  Hence, I have rated this four out of five stars.  It should be noted however, that a number of people did not even try the candy when they saw the fat content.  Of those who really liked the chocolates, only four asked if they could have another piece.  When asked if they would buy them, only six of the seventeen said ""maybe"" or ""yes.""  There was, HOWEVER, one universal response (including those who refused to try a piece) to the Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates: ""They Smell Deliciously Wonderful.""For myself, the one ultimately responsible for this review, I found the Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates disappointing.  I have tried to figure this out: why don't I like this brand of one of my favorite candies?  While I cannot say for sure, I think it is because the enticing smell and hopeful taste are lost to all the different types of butter/butter extracts and fats used in the mixture.  That is to say, I think they put too much into the mixture, and, while the smell may be powerful, I cannot taste the caramel chocolate mixture.  To me, then, Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates are simply a very rich and creamy (to the point of being overbearing or waxy) candy that has no distinctive taste.  So, I am glad I passed the pieces out to get other people's opinions, although at this time (April 4, 2009) this item is currently unavailable.  And I had a great time doing my ""research.""

Overall, this is a slightly better product, with better color and a better taste making the small difference.As with the jalapeno sauce, this product appears to be trying to cover too many bases.  It's ""sauce,"" which means it could go into anything, in cooking or in serving, so it seems to be landing as both a cooking ingredient and as a table condiment.  And it could go on anything from your breakfast eggs to your mac `n cheez for dinner, which makes it a table condiment for breakfast, lunch, dinner, any time.  And its ""bold,"" the American euphemism for something that's not really spicy, is marginally beyond the typical bland and boring that most Americans rely upon.  It's got the tiniest tinge of spice, but isn't powerful in the least; the taste of this product does not qualify as ""bold.""  Now, the taste ofCheez-It Hot & Spicy; they got ""bold"" with that one.The bottle's copy says the same as the jalapeno sauce, that it's perfect with ""tacos, Mexican salads and sandwich wraps.""  In our house it went on pork roast, couscous, green beans, Brussels sprouts, meatloaf, and french fries.  My kids (13 and 15) both liked the sauce and declared it was definitely better than the jalapeno sauce.The basis of this sauce is a mayo/buttermilk dressing-type mixture.  I don't know, but it strikes me that all of the Taco Bell sauces start with the same plain base, and the respective flavors are just dumped in at the factory.  The sauce is not chunky in the slightest, and squeezes right out of the bottle.The pluses in this product are the color and taste.  Where the jalapeno sauce faltered because of an unappetizing color of mayonnaise-off-white with mysterious green flecks, this one's smoky-creamy orange color is far more appealing.  It looks better in the packaging, and it looks much better on the plate and on the food.  The taste also is better. Jalapeno is a very distinctive taste, and those who know it and seek it out want that hard burst of powerful, earthy jalapeno punch, the chipotle taste is one that is more subtle, not nearly as strong, and as such works much better in this sauce.  The taste of this product is slightly smoky, with a good tang--not bold, mind you, and not even close to spicy.The sauce is just a bit too runny, though.  Yeah, it's in a squeeze bottle and it's got to have the right consistency to actually flow out of the packaging, but at the same time, it's a bit too runny when it gets on the plate.  Taco Bell needs to thicken it up just a little bit more to get it to the right consistency.This sauce is not bad; it does not taste bad.  It just doesn't deliver on what I'm looking for when it comes to spicy.  If I were starving on a desert island, I'd slurp this stuff out of the bottle and call it the Food of the Gods.Bottom line: ""Creamy"" this sauce is, but ""bold"" it is not.  Our family knows hot and spicy, and a lame American ""bold"" doesn't cut it for us.  If we want Scoville-graded heat with our food, we'll go for theSriracha,Crystal,Cholula, etc.  If we want creamy, we'll go for the all-American ranch dressing or straight-up mayo, and we'll leave this product on the shelf.

Okay, what exactly is amaranth and quinoa?  I've ridden a camel, been to a state fair and even penetrated Japanese prime ministerial security, but I can't say that I know what this stuff is.From the product page, it appears that the clusters are supposed to be little bite-size globs of vanilla blueberry goodness.  Unfortunately, when mine arrived in the Amazon.com book mailer, I only had two little cluster-like bits.  The rest was smashed and separated into bird seed.  I figure that clusters of this stuff would be pretty good, and make it a lot easier to eat this stuff ""on-the-go!"" as the package copy boldly exhorts.To its credit, the package opened right away, with the first pull, right along the top edge.  You'd be surprised how many packages can't get this right, like tortillas, beef jerky and lunch meat.  So, they had an advantage already.First came the sniff test: how does this stuff smell?  In general, it's kind of an industrial-neutral.  There is no cloying smell of artificial blueberry, which I was relieved not to smell.  There is the distinct and powerful scent of nothing but grain and seed, not salty or spicy, nor sugary sweet.  So far, the ingredients were in step with the package's copy.  There seemed to be just a hint of factory chemicals for the purposes of crunch or freshness or whatever.  I'm not saying that this is in the product, just that I seemed to discern that smell.So, I tried a third of this package in on-the-go mode, right out of the package.  Good stuff.  This would be a great product to bring along on a hike or a campout.  But, the bag's small size would make it awfully hard to share with any more than just a couple of people.  The taste was great, with very clear natural sweetness.  Very crunchy, but not that unpleasant brittle crunchiness you get with some foods.I then tried a third of the package in a little bit of milk, and it was just as good.  It stayed very crunchy for a good long time, all the way through eating it.  The density of it caused most of the product to sink to the bottom, so I had to bottom-feed with my spoon to get it all.Then I put the remaining third into some milk again, and sprinkled some Equal over the top.  Yeah, it was considerably sweeter, maybe even a little too much so.  Recommendation: do not sweeten this product any further.  Real sugar would make this stuff way too sweet.Taste.  The taste is in keeping with the smell, very grainy.  The taste of the blueberries is very subtle, as is the vanilla.  I could taste both, but it was subdued.  Overall, the taste was quite good.  Good texture, too.Nutrition.  Man, you're getting a lot of fiber here.  And there is a lot that this product doesn't have, as the package's front makes clear, like saturated fat, trans fats, cholesterol, etc.  That's pretty good.  But you're also not getting a lot of calcium, iron, or any Vitamin A or C.  While the package's front says there are no ""refined sugars"" in the product, the listed ingredients include official stand-ins/euphemisms for ""sugar,"" like evaporated cane juice.  The product's serving size is a miniscule 1/3 of a cup, and this comes in at 120 calories.  So, a single package, which I ate for dinner, comes in at close to 1300 calories.  Great energy food, but not great for a Saturday morning cereal bender in front of the Cartoon Network.Price.  The unit price comes out to be more than $5/bag.  That's something like more than a dollar more than a big box of cereal (truth be told, the big boxes come out to about 13 oz, and this product comes in at 11 oz).  So, you'll get considerably more product for your money with regular boxed cereal.Bottom line: This is a good product, and I enjoyed it.  The taste and texture is good.

The combination of blueberry and vanilla was extremely appealing to me, so I decided to give it a try, in a cereal bowl with milk.

The product is gluten free, has 750 mg of Omega-3s, there are no refined sugars, no saturated fat (there are 3 grams of fat total in a 1/3 cup serving), no trans fat, 5 grams of fiber, and has very low sodium.  The sweeteners include evaporated cane juice, molasses, blueberry puree, apple puree, plum puree and apple juice.  In essence, it should be the perfect snack.  Unfortunately, it was not.  There was a very mild hint of vanilla flavoring and almost no distinguishable taste of blueberry to be found.  In fact, the granola lacked any kind of flavor at all.  And the granola clusters themselves lacked freshness and tasted quite stale.  The overwhelming smell when you open the bag is definitely flax, and not the formerly mentioned blueberry and vanilla that was advertised.

I like it fine in a mug with a little honey, though if I'm in the mood for real quality green tea, I won't have this as my ""go-to"".On the plus side, it makes a great iced tea.  I brewed up a batch with some mint leaves and have been enjoying the treat in this unseasonably warm Spring.  All in all, if you have a green tea you already love, this probably won't change your opinion, but it's a nice blend for those looking for something a little different.

Following is per-serving nutritional information for those who care:Calories: 110Total Fat: 2.5gMonounsat: 1.5g (the other gram of fat is not accounted for that I could see)Sodium: 130mgPotassium: 85mgTotal Carbs: 22gDietary Fiber: 2gSugars: 8gProtein: 2gWhen compared with Nabisco Honey Maid Lowfat Cinnamon Grahams, these crackers have less calories, sugar and sodium than the Honey Maid Grahams. Honey Maid also uses HFCS (high fructose corn syrup) and partially-hydrogenated oils which these do not. These crackers are sweetened using sugar, honey, evaporated cane juice and brown rice syrup, apple juice concentrate and raisin paste whereas Honey Maid uses honey, molasses, HFCS and dextrose.TASTE AND TEXTURE:TEXTURE: I found these crackers much more delicate than a standard graham cracker. There was a moderate to substantial amount of breakage from the shipping process. I found the dividing line for each cracker (within a sheet) much less discernable than a standard brand of graham crackers. I also found these crackers really dry--moreso than a regular brand. I'm assuming both of these things are because Back to Nature is trying to make a healthier cracker, but that's just my guess.TASTE: This is being sold as an Apple Cinnamon flavored graham cracker. For me, there was far too little graham flavor in these crackers and the cinnamon flavor was very lacking as well. The taste reminded me of a cross between bran muffins with raisins and bran muffins with dehydrated apples. There seemed to be some taste difference between the various sleeves of crackers.SUMMARY:If finding a healthier graham cracker is your primary concern, these may be your best bet. For me, flavor and texture concerns do not make the increased healthiness worth it for me. I have gotten some level of enjoyment out of trying them enough to write a fair review, but I would not buy them again.

From the full nutrition label, Switch lives up to that claim.  The ingredients are juice caoncentrates and added vitamin C.  No added sugar.  Just like juice, you get fruit sugar and fruit nutrients, but none of the fiber.  That's to be expected from a juice, although it seems some other reviewers were alarmed to discover that fruit is sweet due to sugar rather than naturally growing aspartame or sucrose.  Healthwise, this seems fine to me.As to taste:  I was expecting ""Black Cherry"" in a dark red can to be strong.  This was mellow.  I could taste the cherry juice, but I think apple was the dominant flavor.  This tasted remarkably like a children's juice box or a capri sun baggie, probably because it's a mix of juices in which apple is prominent.  It tasted like real juice - not fake.The carbonation was light, and added a bit of texture.  At home, purchasing fruit juice in a bottle and seltzer water in a bottle and mixing them in a glass provides more options and a taste of carbonated fruit juice.  I used to do lots of carbonated fruit juice mixes, and think I prefer plain apple juice and seltzer water to this, mostly because the Switch flavor didn't strike me.  Which juice sits best with you will be a matter of taste, and if you like carbonated fruit juice, then this could be a way to make it portable for bag lunches, road trips, and such.Overall, if you drink a lot of sodas and like fruit juice, this is worth a try, perhaps in the form of one can on a road trip.  It's healthier than soda, because it has real sugar (from fruit, not added) instead of high fructose corn syrup, but not as healthy as a piece of fruit.Oh, yes, here is the nutritional information:8.3 oz.,  130 calories, 0g fat, 15mg sodium, 35g total carb, 33g sugar, 0g protein, 100% of vitamin C.Ingredients:  100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, acerola and cherry juice concentrates), natural flavors, ascorbic acis (Vitamin C) ANSWERNOTFOUND",Just like juice,"(194, 209)",1,0.0,False

Really, I'm game for just about anything.OK, so about this selection:  You get a LOT of different flavors, and you get 2-3 cups per flavor.  So far, I've tried 5 different flavors (Columbian, Fuhgeddaboutit, cinnamon, Boardwalk Blend, and Hazelnut).  Frankly, I've liked all of them.  I usually stay away from ""dark roast,"" but Fuhgeddaboutit was really nice -- definitely a ""dark"" roast, but without that overpowering bitterness I usually find so offensive.  I wouldn't say it's a new favorite, but it's definitely one I could drink again.  Of this group, so far I'd have to say Boardwalk Blend is my favorite -- but I still have several other flavors to try, so I may change my mind.Really, this would be a good ""trial"" package to test out the different flavors available from Brooklyn Beans.

So, I usually brew it up a couple different ways to see how it will come out and adjust from there.First, I followed the instructions on the package and made a pot in a drip coffee maker.  This produced a strong coffee, but it was nasty!  The taste was like someone had dropped in an excessive amount of vanilla extract or sugar free vanilla flavoring.  Kind of like getting a vanilla latte in a tourist trap area.  The next pot, I backed off by reducing the grounds by two scoops and left the amount of water the same.  This produced a weaker but still good coffee taste with very mild hint of vanilla flavoring.  *Much better* in my opinion, and very palatable.  For the third pot, I went for iced coffee, cold brewing in a French press, using the original instructions. The product was very smooth and tasty.  Letting it sit in the fridge overnight after brewing enhanced the flavor.  Finally, I hot brewed it in the French press, again using the original mix ratio from the package.  Sadly, the taste again not so good, though not as bad as the first pot.In the end, I did find two brewing methods that I liked.  While I would have preferred a stronger vanilla flavor, I wasn't able to get it out of this product before I finished the package.

To cut back on that you could cut the chicken and bake it in the oven at 350 for about 30 minutes, thus saving you the saut&eacute;ing which sometimes I do not like to do.

This particular brand is certified organic and non-GMO. It has not been processed with hexane or bleach and it is cold-pressed. It has an excellent aroma and flavor.Normally I use Garden of Life because it comes in a glass jar. However, the plastic used here is free of BPA's.For those with allergies: The label on the coconut oil warns that it may contain trace amounts of tree nuts, sesame seed, and peanuts.Coconut oil is a good substitute for non-organic butter and margarine made from hydrogenated fat (which produces inflammation in the body).Coconut oil adds an exquisite taste to almost any food it is included in, but especially curries, baked goods and homemade ice cream.Coconut oil is excellent for the skin. It moisturizes, protects and heals the skin, and it functions as a mild sunscreen. Its natural smell is heavenly, and it makes a wonderful massage oil. It can be used to condition the hair. When used as a mouthwash, the fatty acid it contains, lauric acid, kills harmful microbes, thereby helping prevent cavities and gum disease.We have, fortunately, moved past the era when consumers were wrongly warned to avoid coconut oil in their diet because it is a saturated fat. As it turns out, liquid, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and, worse, hydrogenated, solid PUFA, which consumers were advised to substitute for saturated fats, are truly awful for the health. Among other problems, they suppress thyroid and immune function and spread free radicals in the body. Coconut oil, on the other hand, has so many health benefits, it is now classified by many health experts as a ""superfood.""Research has indicated that coconut oil is helpful in treating and preventing Alzheimer's, and it helps prevent epileptic seizures. It is protective of the thyroid. It satiates hunger so you crave less food when you eat, and it raises the metabolism so that the body is more efficient in burning fat, especially the most dangerous kind, visceral, abdominal fat. It raises the levels of HDL (good) cholesterol and lowers the levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol in the blood.In addition to the fatty acid, lauric acid, that coconut oil naturally contains, during digestion the body creates from coconut oil a monoglyceride called monolaurin. Both of these fatty acids have the ability to kill harmful bacteria, fungi and viruses in the body. This means that if you regularly consume coconut oil, you are less likely to become sick from food-borne illnesses, flu and colds. It also insulates you from the effects of Staphylococcus Aureus (a very dangerous pathogen) and Candida Albicans, which causes yeast infections throughout the body.Coconut oil is classified as a ""fruit oil,"" and they are considered the healthiest oils around. Other fruit oils include avocado oil, apricot kernel oil, grape seed oil, and olive oil. Technically nut oils are also fruit oils, because a nut can, by one definition, be seen as a ""one-seeded fruit."" However, the reverse is not true of a coconut. Though a coconut is a fruit, is not truly a nut. A true nut, for example an acorn, does not open up when it is mature in order to release its seeds. Instead, the seeds are released when the walls of the fruit decay or it is eaten and digested by an animal and released onto the ground in the midst of animal waste. In contrast, a coconut has three pores or ""eyes"" at one end. Within these pores the coconut seed germinates and a shoot emerges from the pores much in the way shoots emerge from the ""eye"" of a potato.DISCLAIMER: I received a sample of this oil from Viva Labs in order to test it out.

The combination of blueberry and vanilla was extremely appealing to me, so I decided to give it a try, in a cereal bowl with milk.  Let's start with the positive things about the granola, since there is much to like.  The product is gluten free, has 750 mg of Omega-3s, there are no refined sugars, no saturated fat (there are 3 grams of fat total in a 1/3 cup serving), no trans fat, 5 grams of fiber, and has very low sodium.  The sweeteners include evaporated cane juice, molasses, blueberry puree, apple puree, plum puree and apple juice.  In essence, it should be the perfect snack.  Unfortunately, it was not.  There was a very mild hint of vanilla flavoring and almost no distinguishable taste of blueberry to be found.  In fact, the granola lacked any kind of flavor at all.  And the granola clusters themselves lacked freshness and tasted quite stale.  The overwhelming smell when you open the bag is definitely flax, and not the formerly mentioned blueberry and vanilla that was advertised.  So what I had hoped would be a new favorite granola cereal ended up being a bit disappointing.  I wish that the flavor itself could have been better, because the ingredients are just so good for you.  I will more than likely eat some more of this, perhaps in yogurt to ease the crunchiness and stale taste a bit, but I will not be buying the product again.

My mother runs the supplements department of a huge health food store.  I have tasted dozens of health food bars.  Most I wouldn't even consider health food because they are filled with highly-processed extracts of whole foods, such as soy protein (which most people are allergic to).  Even organic food bars are filled with unwholesome ingredients that I would never put into my body.  So I am alway eager to try an organic food bar with an ingredient list short enough to memorize.INGREDIENTSIn a single word - EXCEPTIONAL.  In the market of food bars, this bar is at the top (alongside a few others which I will list below).  Minimal ingredients, all organic, no added sugar, no added thickening agents.  Just nuts and fruits, with a little bit of added organic oil.  Great!  5 stars all the way!TASTEWhen it comes to food, taste is often the deciding factor  (when it really should be ingredients because our taste buds will change very quickly once we stop ingesting super sugary or super salty foods).  Unfortunately most people will rank this bar as mediocre in the taste department. Most people eat far too much sugar and salt in their diet, so any natural foods will taste bland and uninteresting.  For me, however, my taste buds enjoyed the balanced flavor of almond, cashew, blueberry, and date in this bar.  I give it 4 stars for flavor.  It is good, but falls just short of delicious.So there you have it.. a healthy alternative to other food bars out there.  A good natural flavor that is not too sweet.  When you just can't take a cooked me with you to work or on the road, this food bar is a good choice.Overall, I give this bar 5 stars.  5 for ingredients, 4 for flavor, and that extra 1/2 point because making great tasting organic food bars with clean ingredients is so darn difficult.OTHER RECOMMENDATIONSLike I said, I have much experience in the health food world and I love passing on good information when I have it.  So here are my other recommendations for organic food bars.  I purposefully did not include most of the well-known food bars - they are so filled with processed ingredients, indigestible filler ingredients, and sugar that I would never put them in my body.1) Raw Organic Food Bar.  Yup, that's the actual brand name.  They make great bars with ingredients very similar to this bar.  The difference is Raw Organic Food Bars are more oily and sweet.  These are my personal favorites.  They have many flavors, so try a few to find your favorites.  Raw Organic Food Bar, Chocolate Coconut, 1.76-Ounce Bars(Pack of 12), Raw Organic Food Bar, Chocolatey Chocolate Chip, 1.76-Ounce Bars(Pack of 12), Raw Organic Food Bar, Fiber Chocolate Delite, 1.76-Ounce Bars(Pack of 12), Raw Organic Food Bar, Cinnamon Raisin, 1.76-Ounce Bars(Pack of 12)2) Raw Revolution Organic Live Food Bars.  These bars only contain only 3-5 ingredients per bar and everything is raw.  These bars are good as well - more flavor than the Pure Bar, but too sweet or chocolaty sometimes.Raw Revolution Organic Live Food Bars, Spirulina and Cashew, 2.2-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12),Raw Revolution Organic Live Food Bars, Coconut and Chocolate, 2.2-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12),Raw Revolution Organic Live Food Bars, Raspberry and Chocolate, 2.2-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12).3) Greens Plus Organic Food Bars.  This company offer a variety of bars with different ingredients.  Some bars use peanut butter others use cashews.  Some bars use whey protein, others use soy.  So be sure to read the ingredient before you indulge.  This company uses more processed whole food extracts (like the protein powders), but still the company is on the right track.

The sauce is smooth, has some sharpness to it, but is not overly spicy. After the cucumber experiment, I placed the opened bottle in the refrigerator. I will try it again as a salad dressing when the tomatoes in the garden turn red, Right now they are still green. They will probably turn all at once, so I will have to figure out ways to consume them.My impression of the Taco Bell sauce after refrigeration was that it has almost the same consistency as mayonnaise, This gave me another idea. I usually make tuna salad by mixing mayonnaise, hot sauce, and a few spices into the tuna. This time I mixed in only the Taco Bell sauce. Incidentally, the sauce has half the calories per tablespoon compared to the mayonnaise. The tuna salad turned out well. It was very similar to my mayonnaise-based version.I was pleasantly surprised by my initial experiments with the sauce. I have tried both the Chipotle and Jalapeno versions. They both work equally well. That is, I find it hard to tell the differences in taste. The one negative is that they contain artificial coloring and flavoring. They lose a star on that account.

I used ground turkey since I didn't have any chicken breast on-hand.  I'm sure that ground beef, pork or cubed thigh meat would work just as well.  One recommendation:  Stick to the instructions to the tee.  When they say ""simmer & stir often"", they mean very often.  The pasta sticks to the pan if you do not stir it often enough.  I stirred about every 45 seconds to 1 minute during the first 7-minute cooking time and just barely caught the pasta from sticking too much to the pan.  The reason I placed broccoli in quotations in the title is that the teeny-tiny packet of freeze-dried broccoli once placed in the dish near the end of the cooking time becomes pretty much non-existent.

They have a nice texture, combining some crisp rice crunch with creamy smooth filling.  I would eat these bars instead of candy bars, because they taste much better and provide 9 grams of fiber.  They also contain no high fructose corn syrup and they are a more tasty alternative to Metamucil wafers, which often taste like flavored sawdust.Each bar is only 120 calories and is very low in fat, but you should be aware of the carbohydrate count, which is 25 grams.

You get the crackers and spread, dried edamame, ginger nuts and dried fruit, and a little organic chocolate. For the most part, I thought this was really tasty. The salmon spread does taste like salmon, which is great, and the lime and chili complement it well. It's just a tad spicy, so mild that I didn't even notice it until I was well into eating it. I liked the slight kick, and it shouldn't bother people with sensative tongues. The crackers are organic, but you wouldn't know it. They're crunchy and buttery, kind of like Ritz crackers. My favorite item was the fruit and nut mix. They were salty and sweet, and the ginger went so well with the nuts peanuts and cranberries. It had a slight kick, no more than the salmon spread, and this was a great complement. The chocolate was ok. If you've had organic chocolate before, you know what to expect. It wasn't very sweet at 60% cacao, and it wasn't very smooth. Not really my thing, but eh. The only thing I didn't really like was the dried edamame. I generally like edamame, but dried... the first few bites were good. I liked the dry, almost flaky texture. But after a few bites, it tasted a bit weird.This has 16g of fat (25% of your daily value), but only 5g of saturated fat (25% daily value), most of which come from the salmon spread. There are 410 calories and 150 calories from fat.There are only 10mg cholesterol (3% daily value). There are 48g of carbohydrates (16% daily value) and 11g dietary fiber (44% daily value). The sodium isn't bad at 660mg (28% daily value), and neither are the sugars at 21g. The biggest problem is that there's not a whole lot of nutritional value here. You get 22g protien, which is pretty good, but only 10% of your daily value for iron and vitamin C. Fish has plenty of omega-3s, though, and peanuts and cranberries are full of anti-oxidants, so that's something.The packaging is very nice.

The end result is that I was pleasantly surprised at how mellow this ultimately is, given that it's a dark tea. Most of these teas (like black tea) have a very strong and distinctive flavor. This does have that, but it's not nearly as strong tasting as I was expecting.The description of this compares it heavily to chai tea. It's been a while since I've drank the brewed chai tea, as I typically drink the pre-made Oregon Chai stuff, so I can't really tell you how similar this is to the steeped chai teas. This didn't immediately remind me of chai, but then my more recent memories of it are of the Oregon chai and that's pretty much a different beast than brewed chai. I did like the cardamom in this and it really compliments the base tea well.I have to say that I liked the overall taste of this. It has a distinctive flavor but it doesn't kick me in the teeth like some of the black teas do. I also like that I was able to steep this for a little longer than I normally do and it didn't get instantly bitter and undrinkable.As far as the antioxidant claims, I won't be able to back those up with just one box. That's the type of thing that you notice over a longer period of time, but I will say that my coworker has been drinking this stuff for a while now and swears by the stuff. Part of what she likes about it is that it's gentler on her system than black or green tea, so this might be something nice for people who find that these teas are too harsh for them. Caffeine-wise, it does the trick. It's supposed to have about 60-70 milligrams of caffeine, so approach this with caution if you're sensitive.EDIT:A friend recently gave me some pu'erh tea from a tea shop. I have to deduct star ratings because it was such a different tea experience and made this stuff well, ""swill"" in comparison. My coworker got to try a cup of this stuff and she didn't particularly like how it smelled, although she said the taste was well done enough, although not nearly as good as the ""real"" tea.

I eat some in my morning Oatmeal, and I always make it a point to get the Diet Coke with Splenda in it, rather than the aspartame stuff.I have been getting the fiber splenda.  One gram of fiber per packet didn't seem to be much, but it was something to make the sweetener less empty, and it eliminated the gram of dextrose used to stretch the Splenda to make it measure. You occasionally see the tablets of Splenda, but they are rare, and they don't work on oatmeal.So I asked my wife, ""Please surprise me by switching to the Splenda Essentials with Antioxidants some morning over the next week.""  She agreed. On the third morning, I noted an odd taste in my cereal.  Not unpleasant, just odd.I asked her, and she confirmed, that was the first morning she had used the Antioxidant Splenda.So, unlike the fiber splenda, the antioxidant Splenda has a taste.Now, I normally only put sweetener in my coffee if it is nasty tasting.  But I don't have any nasty tasting coffee, so I put the antioxidant Splenda sweetener into regular coffee just to see if I can taste it.I am pretty sure I can taste it, but it is not a blind taste test.  I am going by what I taste in my oatmeal.As I've said, the taste is minor and not unpleasant.  It is hard to detect when I put one packet into 8 ounces of coffee.My opinion is that Splenda is the best artificial sweetener on the market.  The worst tasting is aspartame, then stevia because of the odd licorice overtone. Then saccharine, and that only when a small amount of saccarine is used.  I used to make ice tea with a half gallon of strong tea and one saccharine, and at that ratio, it was not bad.  It took the bitter edge off of the tea.If you can get cyclamates, they go here, and then, at the top, Splenda. Nothing tastes like sugar, especially not corn syrup, but splenda has the most neutral sweet taste of the artificials.  Now that it is available, I try not to use any of the other artificials, and I am not supposed to consume a lot of sugar.So plain splenda would get five stars as an artificial sweetener.  Essentials with fiber would get the same score. Antioxidant gets 4 stars because it has an off taste that is not a bad taste and because it is detectable other than sweetener. I believe that even with this off taste it tastes better than saccharine.  So it loses one star for the detectable taste, but not more.This sweetener comes in a heavy, stiff, hard to tear bag, that could probably survive being kept in a wallet in the rain without damage, and the bag is stiff and strong enough that someone with bad arthritis might not want or be able to use the sweetener in the bag.

I've been eating them little by little over the last few days. I've eaten half the bag now and I can definitely say that I really don't like them at all. In fact, I have no desire to finish the bag.I definitely would not buy this snack again. Neither would I be tempted to take a bite if I found a bowl of them at a party.The package contains four one-quarter cup servings. Each serving consists of about a dozen round marble-sized dried apple clusters held together by concentrated apple juice mixed with potato starch.These round snack clusters are extremely crunchy, needing the powerful back molars to crush them. When I first did this, my mouth felt like it was full of a very dry crunchy substance that when crushed, gave off a dry powder around my mouth. There was nothing to relieve the dry feeling (no lubricating fat or liquid content). This was an odd sensation, and not a pleasant one. Even crunchy chips and nuts have a high fat content to lubricate them. I can't remember tasting anything before that was so crunchy and dry at the same time.After the extreme crunch, the next thing I noticed was an unusual sweetness on top of a very muted apple and cinnamon flavor. I don't mean a strong candy-like sweetness, but rather a sweetness not generally associated with an apple taste. Obviously, these clusters have been soaked in highly concentrated apple juice and the intense sweetness came from what I perceived as too much natural apple sugar. The final sensation I noticed was a nice tart after-taste that lingered after the snack was swallowed.The snack didn't taste bad, but it certainly didn't taste very good either. Personally, I did not like the crunchy dry texture, nor did I enjoy the unnatural sweetness coming from something with subtle apple flavor. The tart after-taste was mildly pleasurable.As an experiment, I grabbed a real apple and cut it up into bite-sized pieces. I tested the two snacks side by side. For me, the real apple was without any doubt the better snack. What I quickly realized in this comparison experiment was what the apple snack lacked over the real thing. An apple is juicy; the snack was dry. The apple has a very complex mixture of many subtle tastes; the snack was dominated by only two overwhelming tastes: sweetness and tartness. The real apple gave off a lovely strong aroma; the snack had very little apple scent at all, even if I stuck my nose into the bag immediately after opening it. Scent is a very important component of taste, and without it, the apple snack was just a dry, crunchy, sugar and tart taste.There is no doubt that dried apples are good for you, but any nutritionist would agree that in going from a fresh fruit to a dried product, a significant amount of enzymes, vitamins, and minerals are lost. I'll stick with eating fresh apples as a snack. ANSWERNOTFOUND",extreme crunch,"(1176, 1190)",2,1.0,True

It is not important if the oil or the tablet is even frozen at the time of production till you consume since any seed, and I mean any type of seed regardless of the brand will go rancid once ground and cracked open since the shell, the protection is removed which will allow air and moisture access the oil of the seed much quicker than when the seed is in a complete un-hulled form. The best example of rancidity is brown rice. Place some brown rice in freezer and you will notice in few months it will not even cook since the oils have gone rancid even if it was kept in a sealed container in the freezer regardless. Chia is the only seed that does not need to be ground in order for human body to digest and get the nutrients and can be stored for longer time than any other seed without going rancid. Sesame seed, flax seed, etc. are so dense that will pass through human body when not ground making it absolutely worthless since human body can not digest it in its natural form.FIBER: Fiber is essential for body since fiber absorbs the unwanted liquid in the gut and body has to defecate that blown up fiber which in return lowers cholesterol, glucose, blood pressure, etc. and brings comfort and efficiency to human body unlike fat which stays in human body unless needed for energy. Flax is high in fiber.MINERALS: Flax is one of the kings of nutrients when it comes to minerals and so important to me as a whole delicious seed; highest ALA, high magnesium, high potassium, calcium with the healthiest fat.Accordingly for 100gr servings size of;SESAME__FLAX__CHIA__AMARANTH__QUINOA__HEMP__PISTACHIO__ALMOND__CASHEW__PEANUTCALORIES565__534__490__371__368__567__557__575__553__585SAT FAT34__18__16__7__4__17__27__19__39__34CALCIUM99__26__63__16__5__0__11__26__4__5MAGNESIUM89__98__0__62__49__167__30__67__73__44POTASSIUM14__23__5__15__16__167__29__20__19__19ZINC48__29__23__19__21__83__15__21__39__22FIBER47__109__151__8__11__4 __41__49__13__32PHYTOSTEROLS714__0__0__0__0__N/A__214__0__0__0FRESHNESS: Fresh means nutritious and delicious. I consume lots of seeds, beans, grains, vegetables, etc. and freshness is a priority regardless of the brand so I always purchase my food ingredients in small quantities from reputable sellers with high turnover. When fresh, food is nutritious and that goes for any food in any form, from frozen to canned. Fresh food is nutritious as well as delicious since nutrients give food its delicious taste. When old or rancid, nutrients are gone and any food item becomes an empty calories with no taste and absolutely worthless regardless of the brand or price, organic or conventional. For few years I consumed seeds in oil form since physicians advised me to do so not knowing that majority are not aware that seeds hardly offer any nutrients unless; seeds are fresh, not old which means rancid, not in oil form, not in supplement form, not hulled, ground and consumed within few days, kept in dark cold temperatures, away from light-sun-moisture since the oil in seeds and nuts go rancid regardless. That is why brown rice which has its nutrients will go rancid even if kept in freezer while white rice will last for years at room temperature since it hardly has any nutrients or oil. I ground in my coffee grinder sesame, flax, chia, amaranth, hemp then add cocoa, isolate protein, soy milk and consume it before my workouts on daily basis for its vitamins, minerals, protein and many nutrients, without much spike in my glucose. Un-hulled seeds are full of nutrients. I never consume hulled seeds which are empty calories, absolutely worthless since the nutrients have been removed.OMEGA-3: You will never see ALA on any fish you purchase. Infact you will never see ALA on any fish oil supplement either, you will only see EPA and DHA. ALA is not the same as EPA or DHA. That is true for any brand of flaxseed regardless if such flaxseed oil is in solid form, oil form in a bottle or in a capsule form. Greens, veges, nuts, seeds and fruits do not offer any Omega-3 in form of EPA/DHA since omega-3 EPA/DHA is an animal source. There are two major types of omega-3 fatty acids in our diets: One type is alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which is found in plants the other type, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is found in fatty fish. The body partially converts ALA to EPA and DHA. There is no proof what percent of ALA gets converted by human body to EPA or DHA. You can consume all ALAs that you want and depending to your genes it may never turn any into omega-3. Blood test is the only way to see the affects. I get omega 3 from sardines although flaxseed is an important part of my diet since flaxseed offers so many nutrients.

This particular brand is certified organic and non-GMO. It has not been processed with hexane or bleach and it is cold-pressed. It has an excellent aroma and flavor.Normally I use Garden of Life because it comes in a glass jar. However, the plastic used here is free of BPA's.For those with allergies: The label on the coconut oil warns that it may contain trace amounts of tree nuts, sesame seed, and peanuts.Coconut oil is a good substitute for non-organic butter and margarine made from hydrogenated fat (which produces inflammation in the body).Coconut oil adds an exquisite taste to almost any food it is included in, but especially curries, baked goods and homemade ice cream.Coconut oil is excellent for the skin. It moisturizes, protects and heals the skin, and it functions as a mild sunscreen. Its natural smell is heavenly, and it makes a wonderful massage oil. It can be used to condition the hair. When used as a mouthwash, the fatty acid it contains, lauric acid, kills harmful microbes, thereby helping prevent cavities and gum disease.We have, fortunately, moved past the era when consumers were wrongly warned to avoid coconut oil in their diet because it is a saturated fat. As it turns out, liquid, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and, worse, hydrogenated, solid PUFA, which consumers were advised to substitute for saturated fats, are truly awful for the health. Among other problems, they suppress thyroid and immune function and spread free radicals in the body. Coconut oil, on the other hand, has so many health benefits, it is now classified by many health experts as a ""superfood.""Research has indicated that coconut oil is helpful in treating and preventing Alzheimer's, and it helps prevent epileptic seizures. It is protective of the thyroid. It satiates hunger so you crave less food when you eat, and it raises the metabolism so that the body is more efficient in burning fat, especially the most dangerous kind, visceral, abdominal fat. It raises the levels of HDL (good) cholesterol and lowers the levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol in the blood.In addition to the fatty acid, lauric acid, that coconut oil naturally contains, during digestion the body creates from coconut oil a monoglyceride called monolaurin. Both of these fatty acids have the ability to kill harmful bacteria, fungi and viruses in the body. This means that if you regularly consume coconut oil, you are less likely to become sick from food-borne illnesses, flu and colds. It also insulates you from the effects of Staphylococcus Aureus (a very dangerous pathogen) and Candida Albicans, which causes yeast infections throughout the body.Coconut oil is classified as a ""fruit oil,"" and they are considered the healthiest oils around. Other fruit oils include avocado oil, apricot kernel oil, grape seed oil, and olive oil. Technically nut oils are also fruit oils, because a nut can, by one definition, be seen as a ""one-seeded fruit."" However, the reverse is not true of a coconut. Though a coconut is a fruit, is not truly a nut. A true nut, for example an acorn, does not open up when it is mature in order to release its seeds. Instead, the seeds are released when the walls of the fruit decay or it is eaten and digested by an animal and released onto the ground in the midst of animal waste. In contrast, a coconut has three pores or ""eyes"" at one end. Within these pores the coconut seed germinates and a shoot emerges from the pores much in the way shoots emerge from the ""eye"" of a potato.DISCLAIMER: I received a sample of this oil from Viva Labs in order to test it out.

The cookies are relatively small (somewhere between 1-1/2 to 2 inches in diameter), but they are filled to the brim with gingery goodness, which you would hope for in a ginger snap. I wouldn't think these would be for someone with a casual liking of ginger, but for those who enjoy it more, these are sure to please as far as flavor goes. As for the crunch, these are a hard cookie and not for those with gentle teeth, but they are, after all, a ginger snap. Ginger snaps are not known to be soft in any way, shape, or form. Rest assured that these won't break in shipment. My bag of cookies survived their journey even though they came in a soft envelope, which in turn was crammed into my cluster mailbox.

While these claim to be Vegan, I see that it doesn't say 'organic sugar' listed in the ingredients to the candied sugar, just 'sugar', so one wonders about that.

I actually really liked the taste of it. Unlike your typical sodas, this drink did not have the lingering carbonated fizz and I didn't get any disgusting soda burps after drinking it. You know the kind I mean, when you burp and anyone within 20 or 30 yards of you is running for fresh air. I also didn't get any real aftertaste when drinking it either.Now coming in at 8.3 ounces, the calories in this drink are reported at 135 calories per can. By comparison, a 12 ounce can of Pepsi comes in at 150 calories per can. So, on the calorie front I wouldn't say that there is much of a difference between this drink and Pepsi, although if you do the math, this drink would actually have more calories than Pepsi if you compared them in equal amounts. However, if you look at the list of ingredients in both, you can see where this product is far better for you than your traditional sodas, although obviously not as good for you as drinking an actual 100% pure fruit or vegetable juice.To put in plainly and succinctly, this is a really good tasting beverage and is definitely one I would consider drinking over the more traditional sodas that are currently available. However, the one primary detractor to this is the size of the can compared to the price.The one thing that I had not quite decided on whether it is a negative or a positive is the size of the can, which as I stated earlier comes in at 8.3 ounces compared to your traditional cans of soda that come in at 12 ounces. In addition to the size of the can, there is also the consideration of price, coming in at roughly $1.00 per can which is considerably more expensive than your average can of soda. Therefore, when you take the size of the product combined with the price, I would have to say that it is a definite negative, although this one tasted so good to me that I will definitely be purchasing this product.Shawn KovacichCreator of numerous books and DVD's.

I stirred about every 45 seconds to 1 minute during the first 7-minute cooking time and just barely caught the pasta from sticking too much to the pan.

Some reviewers have commented and even complained about this sparkling juice having only the barest amount of carbonation.  Not so with the ones I have tried, so perhaps these other reviewers left the top open and allowed it to go flat or something. Believe me, this had lively carbonation, and a good, natural tasting tart orange flavor.  The size of the can is convenient, too - takes up hardly any space in the fridge or in the lunch sack.As part of the ""Vine"" program, I received and tasted three different flavors but Amazon will not allow me to publish a separate review of each flavor.  So I am combining them all into one.Apple flavor: like biting into a crisp, green apple and savoring the peel and the fruit/meat at the same time. It has nice, clean and refreshing flavors with an excellent balance of carbonation. Normally I am not a fan of apple juice or sparkling cider but this one I liked.  It is not cloying or flabby-tasting as I find most apple beverages to be, probably because this is green and not red apple-flavored.Grapefruit flavor: this was my least favorite of the bunch, but if you prefer a very tart flavor, this fits the bill nicely. Again, a good balance of carbonation, crisp, and refreshing, this had good pink grapefruit taste but I also detected a plastic-tasting element.  The aftertaste was pure grapefruit so I don't know where that plastic came from or where it went, but it did mar an otherwise nice drinking experience.Overall I rate these Izze beverages very high.

It&#8217;s amazing. It works perfectly as a butter substitute, greases up a pan better than Crisco, and has become my wife and I&#8217;s favorite handy cooking oil.

About the only thing I can compare it to is duck fat, which melts in about the same way and also adds a nice unctuous flavor and undertones.And yes, it also makes a great moisturizer and hair product.

However what I do use a variety of sauces for, is flavoring for other dishes.  In particular I often make a dish that consists mostly of lentils and brown rice which is quite delicious and made more so by adding different sauces to it for each serving.  For that reason I am always looking for new and different flavors to add, since each new sauce makes the dish different than the time before, keeping me from getting bored with it.In addition, I love spicy foods.  I don't think of Jalapeno as being especially hot - the only hot Jalapeno peppers I've ever had were the ones I grew and ate fresh-picked.

Of my four cans, one was nearly undamaged.  One had cosmetic damage in the form of a dented side.  The other two were dented to the extent of having sharp creases in the bottom and flaws near the seal lines at the top.  I never buy cans like those at the supermarket.COOKINGThe cooking went much better than I expected.  The evening before, I put 1/4 cup chopped black walnuts, 10 pitted prunes cut into pieces with scissors, and two cups of water into my saucepan.  I brought this mixture to a boil over a simmering-level flame on my propane stove.  I dumped in one-half-cup of McCann's steel cut oats and stirred.  I waited for the mixture to come to a boil again, stirred it a little, turned off the flame, put a lid on the saucepan, and went to bed.  In the morning I was surprised to find that it was perfectly edible with no further cooking.  I did heat it up again on the stove before serving but it stuck to the pot, so I think in the future I will microwave it right in the bowls just before serving it.EATINGThese oats were good, but it was hard to say if they were ""nuttier"" in flavor than the Old-Fashioned Rolled Oats which I had been eating because I cooked them both with nuts.  The texture was of course firmer.  I do like bulgar wheat and these oats are more like that in texture.  Since I was careful not to overcook the rolled oats, there was not much difference in the ""slime"" feel of the two, but the rolled oats were papery much like eating raw oatmeal cookie dough.NUTRITIONI found little difference between the nutritional content listed on the McCann steel cut can and that listed on the Old-Fashioned Rolled Oats container.  I had to do some Internet research to find the differences which turn out to be subtle but important for certain types of health conditions.  There is also the likelihood of the product simply being fresher due to less processing and better packaging at the mill.REPEAT PURCHASENow that I have found that the cooking of steel cut oats is much less intimidating than I had imagined, I will probably eat these in preferance to rolled oats in the future.  The possibility of adding them to soups and other cooked entrees in place of barley or bulgar wheat is a bonus.  However, I will probably try a more economical source as I am not convinced that Ireland's soil is superior to that in any other region in which oats are farmed, and metal cans with sharp creases and bent seams don't seem worth the extra cost.

It is not important if the oil or the tablet is even frozen at the time of production till you consume since any seed, and I mean any type of seed regardless of the brand will go rancid once ground and cracked open since the shell, the protection is removed which will allow air and moisture access the oil of the seed much quicker than when the seed is in a complete un-hulled form. The best example of rancidity is brown rice. Place some brown rice in freezer and you will notice in few months it will not even cook since the oils have gone rancid even if it was kept in a sealed container in the freezer regardless. Chia is the only seed that does not need to be ground in order for human body to digest and get the nutrients and can be stored for longer time than any other seed without going rancid. Sesame seed, flax seed, etc. are so dense that will pass through human body when not ground making it absolutely worthless since human body can not digest it in its natural form.FIBER: Fiber is essential for body since fiber absorbs the unwanted liquid in the gut and body has to defecate that blown up fiber which in return lowers cholesterol, glucose, blood pressure, etc. and brings comfort and efficiency to human body unlike fat which stays in human body unless needed for energy.

I consume lots of seeds, beans, grains, vegetables, etc. and freshness is a priority regardless of the brand so I always purchase my food ingredients in small quantities from reputable sellers with high turnover. When fresh, food is nutritious and that goes for any food in any form, from frozen to canned. Fresh food is nutritious as well as delicious since nutrients give food its delicious taste. When old or rancid, nutrients are gone and any food item becomes an empty calories with no taste and absolutely worthless regardless of the brand or price, organic or conventional. For few years I consumed seeds in oil form since physicians advised me to do so not knowing that majority are not aware that seeds hardly offer any nutrients unless; seeds are fresh, not old which means rancid, not in oil form, not in supplement form, not hulled, ground and consumed within few days, kept in dark cold temperatures, away from light-sun-moisture since the oil in seeds and nuts go rancid regardless. That is why brown rice which has its nutrients will go rancid even if kept in freezer while white rice will last for years at room temperature since it hardly has any nutrients or oil. I ground in my coffee grinder sesame, flax, chia, amaranth, hemp then add cocoa, isolate protein, soy milk and consume it before my workouts on daily basis for its vitamins, minerals, protein and many nutrients, without much spike in my glucose. Un-hulled seeds are full of nutrients. I never consume hulled seeds which are empty calories, absolutely worthless since the nutrients have been removed.OMEGA-3: You will never see ALA on any fish you purchase. Infact you will never see ALA on any fish oil supplement either, you will only see EPA and DHA. ALA is not the same as EPA or DHA. That is true for any brand of flaxseed regardless if such flaxseed oil is in solid form, oil form in a bottle or in a capsule form. Greens, veges, nuts, seeds and fruits do not offer any Omega-3 in form of EPA/DHA since omega-3 EPA/DHA is an animal source. There are two major types of omega-3 fatty acids in our diets: One type is alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which is found in plants the other type, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is found in fatty fish. The body partially converts ALA to EPA and DHA. There is no proof what percent of ALA gets converted by human body to EPA or DHA. You can consume all ALAs that you want and depending to your genes it may never turn any into omega-3. Blood test is the only way to see the affects. I get omega 3 from sardines although flaxseed is an important part of my diet since flaxseed offers so many nutrients. Flaxseed offers more ALA than chia for $1.99 a pound not $15 a pound, 22.8gr vs. 17.8gr. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(4938, 4952)",1,0.0,False

You get the crackers and spread, dried edamame, ginger nuts and dried fruit, and a little organic chocolate. For the most part, I thought this was really tasty. The salmon spread does taste like salmon, which is great, and the lime and chili complement it well. It's just a tad spicy, so mild that I didn't even notice it until I was well into eating it. I liked the slight kick, and it shouldn't bother people with sensative tongues. The crackers are organic, but you wouldn't know it. They're crunchy and buttery, kind of like Ritz crackers. My favorite item was the fruit and nut mix. They were salty and sweet, and the ginger went so well with the nuts peanuts and cranberries. It had a slight kick, no more than the salmon spread, and this was a great complement. The chocolate was ok. If you've had organic chocolate before, you know what to expect.

All you do is mix 2 tablespoons of the salad dressing mix with 1/3 cup of wine or cider vinegar and 2/3 cup of olive oil or salad oil. I used red wine vinegar and olive oil and the dressing was a big hit with the entire family! Much better than the pre-mixed bottled dressings or the other mixes I've tried, like Good Seasons. I also have used the salad dressing mix as a dry rub for boneless, skinless chicken breasts, and the flavor it infused into the meat was delectable. Tonight I am going to go back to the Classic Vinaigrette and use it to marinate pork chops before grilling. I also think the Homemade Dressings mix will work wonderfully as an all-purpose seasoning (like Mrs. Dash).

Still, just like I believe wine in a bag or box could be good if you actually use good wine - better, maybe, depending on the wine and what you intend to use it for - I also believe that using good beans and processing them properly you could, maybe, get an excellent cup of coffee in a can.Normally I wouldn't be trying coffee in a can simply because it usually seems to have milk in it and I don't consume any dairy, but this illy issimo contains just coffee, sugar, potassium bicarbonate, and potassium citrate. I'm not sure what the last two ingredients are for, but wikipedia says they both impart a slightly salty taste and are used to regulate ph...so maybe it's either of those or both. The can says ""100% natural arabica"". Not sure what the ""natural"" part is supposed to mean - maybe it's just a way to sneak ""natural"" onto the label - it's a term that's not really regulated so it's slapped on a lot of stuff without really meaning anything. Not too impressed with the ""arabica"" part...75% of all coffee produced is arabica and some of it is pretty nasty dross. Still, illy is supposed to have a good reputation, so despite the meaningless hype on the can I have tentative high hopes for it.These cans are kind of small, closer to a Red Bull than your traditional can of soda. I put my can in the fridge to chill it, then opened it and took a sip. Well, blech...I did not like that at all, but then I normally don't like coffee and sugar without any (non-dairy) milk, so not really a surprise. I put four ice cubes in a glass and then the coffee and it filled my glass most of the way. The rest of the glass I filled with one of my two favorite soy milks, Sunrich Naturals (which is the one they use at Blue Bottle) gave a little stir and sipped again. This time, it actually tasted good! Good enough to drink the entire thing, even though really I'd had my coffee for the day. Oh yeah, and better than an iced latte from Peet's or Starbucks!Would I drink this again? Yes, actually I would. The main thing stopping me would be that I'd only want to drink it if I had access to a glass with ice and some soy (or other non-dairy) milk, which certainly could happen but if I'm at home I might just as well roast and grind my own beans and if I'm not at home all of a sudden the whole ice/glass/soymilk thing requires some pre-planning. They should make illy issimo canned coffee drinks with soymilk right in the can...then I bet I could think of lots of reasons to keep a case of it on hand.

It is much lighter tasting than actual black cherry sodas I've had, such as Dr. Brown's.INGREDIENTS:The Switch is advertised as 100% juice.  It is, but it is juice from concentrate.  I prefer juice squeezed from the fruit or vegetable itself.  In the case of The Switch the concentrate is filtered sparkling water.  I'm fine drinking concentrates and I drink soda too so I'm not being a health fanatic, but be aware if you are expecting actual juice, this product is filtered water used to reconstitute the juice concentrate.  The juices uses are apple, grape, acerola and cherry.  If you aren't familiar with acerola, it is a cherry like fruit, but with three lobes.  Acerola is high in Vitamin C.NUTRITION:One 8.3 ounce can of The Switch Black Cherry contains:* 130 calories* 15 mg sodium*35 g carbs (33 g sugar)So keep in mind while it has no added sugar it still has the sugar content from its ingredients.  It has more calories than a can of Coke Classic!  It does not have any corn syrup or added sugars though.It also contains 100% of the recommended level of Vitamin C.PRICE:The product costs more than soda, but the ingredients are better.  It costs a little less than Knudsen's Black Cherry Spritzer product.  I use this comparison because the Knudsen product is similar in taste and basic content (filtered sparkling water, fruit concentrate), but a little different in ingredients (no acerola, using pear, pineapple and plum instead), with The Switch having a slight bit more carbs and sugars.Overall, this is a tasty drink.  It is somewhere between a soda and a health drink, definitely better for you than a soda, but not quite as ""natural"" as say all natural juices.

In fact, the vanilla is very hard to taste at all.I decided to brew this coffee in two separate ways:  1) Per the instructions on the bag (two tablespoons per six ounces of water) and 2) By my normal method (three tablespoons per six ounces of water).After brewing the coffee, I drank each brewed cup in three different ways:  1) black (which is my normal method of drinking coffee), 2) with one teaspoon of cream and one teaspoon of sugar, and 3) with two teaspoons of cream and two teaspoons of sugar.What I immediately noticed was that the bag's brewing instructions suited my personal taste best.  My normal brewing method made the coffee stronger (as I like it), but didn't alter the taste at all.When I drank the coffee black in both brewing cases, I noticed almost no difference in the taste, although the coffee's body was a bit heavier in the second brewing method.  The vanilla flavor was miniscule.With one teaspoon of cream and one teaspoon of sugar, I found that the vanilla flavor stood out a bit more, but was still fairly weak.  The overall taste of the coffee was good, though.With two teaspoons of cream and sugar, the vanilla came into its own a bit more, but could not overtake the coffee's taste itself.Overall, this is a coffee drinker's flavored coffee.  If you want a fuller, sweeter vanilla taste and less coffee taste, look elsewhere.  If you only drink flavored coffees as a treat but prefer the taste of medium to dark roast coffee alone, this brew will be right up your alley.I personally enjoyed this coffee, and plan to buy more of it soon.

I also have used the salad dressing mix as a dry rub for boneless, skinless chicken breasts, and the flavor it infused into the meat was delectable. Tonight I am going to go back to the Classic Vinaigrette and use it to marinate pork chops before grilling. I also think the Homemade Dressings mix will work wonderfully as an all-purpose seasoning (like Mrs. Dash).

I admit that it does have a nice, enticing aroma and the combination of these two ingredients sounds appealing, both for the potential flavor and for the settling effects on the stomach. However, the taste of this beverage is not what I expected. It doesn't taste as natural as I thought it would and it has a certain harshness that is most evident in the back of the throat. I followed the directions and added a cup of hot water, but considering the harsh flavor, perhaps I should have used more water.Among the flavors present, the ginger is the one most noticeable and it's the spicy finish that creates that harshness. I was able to finish mine off by taking only small sips at a time, but I can understand why some would have a difficult time drinking this instant beverage.

It's a happy medium, although I do recommend that you try to get these as fresh as possible since I can't imagine trying to eat these when they've a little old or have been exposed to air & not stored properly.The bad thing is that these just have this funky aftertaste to them. The basic taste is fine enough. It doesn't taste like pomegranate & normally I'd be OK with this since candy often labels things ""watermelon"" or ""strawberry"" when it doesn't taste anything remotely like the fruit. Since this is supposed to be mostly organic & natural, I really expected it to taste more like actual pomegranate.

I can't really explain it but it's not a taste that I'd really care to have in my mouth.One thing I do want to mention is that out of the 11 ingredients in this product, only 3 are organic. That doesn't bother me much, but I know that there are some people who get irritated at how some labels mention ""organic"" but only a small part of it is actually organic. At that point you really can't call the product organic since it has non-organic product in it. (There's no USDA organic label on this anywhere, if you were wondering, which can only be put on if a certain percentage of the product is organic.) Note that this product didn't have ""made with organic ingredients"" on it, just ""made with organic sugar"". The people who label watch for organic products will know what that means. I mention all of this because I know some are very picky about product that have organic anywhere on it.Overall I wasn't really that enthusiastic about this product. It wasn't horrible but I can safely say that I probably won't be buying any of these in the future. I might & I stress *might* try one of the other flavors, but that'd only be if the price was right.EDIT:Updated to say that I won't be buying any of this in the future. The licorice I ate later is really making me feel a little gross. Like another reviewer said, it's just sitting there like a pile of lead & is giving me some pretty bad indigestion.

I definitely won't change brands, but it is nice to know that there are other options out there if you find yourself in a place that doesn't carry the Lara Bar.
