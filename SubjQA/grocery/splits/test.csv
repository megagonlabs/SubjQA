Not a Fair Trade product.KEEN-Waah... A complete protein source, a seed related to other healthy cousins like spinach and beets. In a pot I place quinoa, frozen peas, carrots, corn, add water and tomato paste. Spinach is added at the end the last minute. Stewing tomatoes for a half hour increases the cancer fighting lycopene content by 35 percent. Cooking also unlocks another nutrient, beta-carotene, in corn and carrots since heat breaks down the fibrous cell walls, releasing more of these antioxidants. The same goes for spinach but then you need to get your vitamin C from something else since that is the first vitamin which is depleted with heat. I saute lots of onion separately then in ten minutes I add paprika, cumin, dillweed, gram marsala, crushed red pepper, turmeric and lots of garlic2 x 2 Pound Fresh Garlic USA California Heirloom Monviso Gilroy Finest (4 Pounds Total), mix it well and add the mix to the pot and let it sit without heat for five minutes. This is what vegans consume instead of beef since it is a complete protein. Greens, vegetables, nuts, seeds, etc. may have protein but the fact is that only quinoa has a complete protein and all others do not since all others are missing few amino acids here and there but not quinoa. I rarely ever consume beef, chicken, etc. so fish and quinoa are the only source of complete protein with all amino acids for me. Organic, whole grain, very fulfilling due to some starch with host of vitamins, minerals that no beef or chicken can even come close to. Cooks in ten minutes with some water, no fat, no salt, no sugar... I consume it with eggplant, onions, okra, smoked hearings, curry type dishes with lots of spices and delicious juices. I never ever have to wash and rinse before cooking either. I keep the uncooked portions in double zip lock bags in freezer. I consume so much that I never have to worry about the unused portion going rancid and unlike brown rice which loses its oil in less than six months and becomes worthless even if kept in freezer, quinoa will last longer. Obviously I never ever do that with any food since I only purchase what I need in order to get the nutrients which are a healthy portion of my diet. Gluten free, the best product for me when I go camping since all I do is add lemon and tomato and that way I never have to worry about paying arm and leg for that lousy, awful tasting dry foods. I ground chia+flax+sesame, mix it with cocoa+isolate+soy milk before my workouts every single day or no workout regardless. Three tbsp of quinoa in my power drink offers me 4gr of pure, complete protein with all amino acids. I add organic paprika to regular yellow quinoa and it turns the dish into a beautiful red color. Healthy, healthier and healthiest of many seeds, delicious sprouts only in 3 days with all amino acids. I am an athlete with a healthy diet. I used to consume brown rice heavily years ago but no longer. I can consume quinoa with tomato and lemon juice and it is the best food I can take with me anywhere on any sports trip and I do not even have to wash it either. Delicious, delicious, delicious.FRESHNESS: Fresh means nutritious and delicious. I consume lots of seeds, beans, grains, vegetables, etc. and freshness is a priority regardless of the brand so I always purchase my food ingredients in small quantities from reputable sellers with high turnover. When fresh, food is nutritious and that goes for any food in any form, from frozen to canned. Fresh food is nutritious as well as delicious since nutrients give food its delicious taste. When old or rancid, nutrients are gone and any food item becomes an empty calories with no taste and absolutely worthless regardless of the brand or price, organic or conventional. For few years I consumed seeds in oil form since physicians advised me to do so not knowing that majority are not aware that seeds hardly offer any nutrients unless; seeds are fresh, not old which means rancid, not in oil form, not in supplement form, not hulled, ground and consumed within few days, kept in dark cold temperatures, away from light-sun-moisture since the oil in seeds and nuts go rancid regardless. That is why brown rice which has its nutrients will go rancid even if kept in freezer while white rice will last for years at room temperature since it hardly has any nutrients or oil. I ground in my coffee grinder sesame, flax, chia, amaranth, hemp then add cocoa, isolate protein, soy milk and consume it before my workouts on daily basis for its vitamins, minerals, protein and many nutrients, without much spike in my glucose. Un-hulled seeds are full of nutrients. I never consume hulled seeds which are empty calories, absolutely worthless since the nutrients have been removed.STARCH: Some carbohydrates, such as sugars and most starch are rapidly digested and absorbed as glucose into the body through the small intestine and subsequently used for short-term energy needs or stored. Resistant starch on the other hand, resists digestion and passes through to the large intestine where it acts like dietary fiber. Sugar, honey, maple syrup, white flour, white rice, whole-grain pastry flour, packaged cold cereals, commercial fruit juices, and fruit-juice sweetened beverages are the same foods some dentists claim rots the teeth from the inside out by changing the balance and ratio of calcium to phosphorous in the bloodstream. Your immune system goes down when you wolf down sweets, especially around events and holiday meals. High Glycemic foods quickly turn to sugar in your blood stream, causing excess insulin to pour into your blood to get rid of the excess sugar. The excess insulin pushes the calcium and fat into your arteries, especially if you have only a few cholesterol receptors on your liver (which is genetic). Whole wheat and white bread have essentially the same impact on blood sugar so I try to consume bread with whole sprouted grains, even flourless breads, and no-yeast breads. Black beans, northern beans, navy beans, red kidney beans, lentils, split peas, black-eyed peas, brown rice, rolled oats, millet, corn, black rice are all Resistance Starch.

I'm not sure I'd describe myself as a ""tea connoisseur"" but I'm pretty experienced with tea.  I've tried just about every type of tea out there (white, black, green, herbal, even puerh tea!), and I regularly make my own custom blends using loose leaf herbs and spices.  I'm a pretty big fan of tea, so I naturally jumped at the chance to get some nice chai tea.  I already have my own homemade chai recipes that involve simmering loose spices and adding in milk and sugar, and it's great, but I've always wanted to try some plain chai without the milk.So I got the Higgins and Burk Chai in the mail and decided to brew myself a cup to try out.  I steeped it a full 10 minutes because I steep all my tea for 10 minutes (I suspect a lot of people would find this too strong for their tastes, but that's how I like it).  My first impressions of this tea is that it's pretty weak for a chai style tea.  I felt like the strongest taste was the cloves, and it really could've used stronger notes of ginger and cinnamon.  Not to mention, the black tea portion of it tastes a bit not-so-good to me.  It's difficult to describe, but I'll explain it as best as I can.  I once bought a huge box of cheap crappy pekoe black tea and it tasted terrible.  It was just lacking in good flavor and only tasted of bitter tannins and blandness and nothing else.  This tea is not nearly as bad as that one was, but the black tea portion of it seems to have a bit of that taste to it.  I had my own Assam tea (before I used it all and ran out) and it seemed to taste much better than this - even plain with nothing else in it!  Of course, it could've been because of the source of my teas/spices (I get everything from the mountainroseherbs website); maybe the tea is better from there.  Anyway, the other spices in the tea hide it well enough so it's not a big deal.  I did decide to make my own homemade blend to see how it would turn out using the same ingredients (I used 2 parts black tea, 1/2 part cinnamon, 1/8 part cloves, 1/8 part cardamom, and 1/2 part ginger).  Then I did a side by side taste test using the exact same amount of sweetener.  The Higgins and Burke version is not terrible or anything, but I still think my version won by a small margin.Anyway, if you're a casual tea drinker, this tea will probably be fine for your tastes, and far more convenient than making your own loose-leaf blends.  In addition, if you are the sort who prefers a less spicy chai then this tea would be great!  In the course of further usage, I also discovered that the Higgins and Burke tastes better as an iced tea.  Go figure!  Well, my overall opinion of the Higgins and Burke Black Chai is that it is a decent choice for anyone who wants a mild pleasant chai in a convenient tea-bag option, but I think I'm going to personally stick to my own homemade formula because I love making loose leaf tea blends!

While I was a bit skeptical of the five calories proposed for each 8-ounce serving, seeing as how honey is a fairly high caloric sweetener, I figured I'd give it a go anyway. So after receiving the tea, I mixed it up per the instructions and took a sip. Yowzas! The tea was super sweet with a bit of strawberry flavor and no tea that I could taste. I ended up watering the tea down enough that one packet, which is usually two servings, ends up as four or five 8-oz. servings. The berry flavor became very diluted while there was still that taste of icky sweetness. Overall the berry flavors and tea are weak, even undiluted, and I noticed no honey flavor what-so-ever, so took a look-see at the ingredients where I spotted sucralose (an artificial sweetener) thrown right in the middle of things. Now that is where the sweetness is and don't take kindly to that addition, as I avoid artificial sweeteners whenever possible. Seeing as how Lipton is sneakily claiming this is sweetened with honey (And look! NO aspartame!), with no mention that in actuality the sweeteners are honey granules, which are made from both honey and sugar, and sucralose except by viewing the ingredients list, makes me angry because I've been swindled. Yeah, this is natural all right. I'm definitely not going to trust Lipton's marketing from now on and urge them to think about switching to a natural sweetener such as stevia.

There are two justifications for these benefits: the increases electrolytes and the pH of 9.5.These health claims are the sort of thing that really need to be evaluated by scientific trials, not by individual experiences. But a bit of quick googling about ""alkaline water health benefits"" shows that the scientific literature is pretty thin. There seems to have been one study saying that alkaline water increases bone density, which is a good thing for people worrying about osteoporosis, and another study saying that it improved hydration. Meanwhile, various anecdotal sources say that it can reduce acid reflux, which seems particularly plausible just from a priori reasoning: if you're having problems with acid, you might be able to neutralize it by adding a base.I don't personally suffer from acid reflux, so I can't assess its effectiveness there, but if it's a problem that you do have, then it might be worth giving this water a try since you'll be able to see very quickly whether it works for you. The potential benefits against osteoporosis, on the other hand, are longer-term, so without seeing further scientific studies I wouldn't personally want to embark on a program of drinking expensive bottled water indefinitely, since it would be harder to judge whether it was actually working. The interest for me, then, was mainly in the improved hydration.I'm a casual runner, and I hate to carry water with me, so it's not uncommon for me to end up with a slight dehydration headache even after consuming water when I get home. That happened once this week already, when I went for a 5-mile run just after noon.I drank my 1.5 L sample of Essentia over two days (along with other fluids, of course). On the first day, I didn't run at all, but walked about four miles. On the second day, I went for two short runs, 1.8 miles each way to the bookstore and back in the middle of the afternoon. It was sunny out, so I felt pretty sweaty by the end of it. I drank Essentia before and after the run, though there wasn't much left by the end, and so I also drank about 750 mL of regular water as well.I didn't end up with a dehydration headache, and I also slept well that night, but there are too many other variables at play for me to attribute these good things purely to the Essentia. Maybe the difference from my previous run was the much shorter length, or the time of day, or just the overall quantity of water that I consumed afterwards, regardless of whether it was Essentia. While I'm intrigued with Essentia's claims, I'm not entirely convinced. I'd be willing to try drinking Essentia over a longer period of time if it were provided to me for free, but for the moment, the benefits aren't clear enough to me that I'm willing to purchase it in quantity for myself at more than $2/bottle. I'll await further studies.The one thing I can comment on with confidence is the taste, which seemed pretty average to me. There is something slightly different about it, but I find it hard to describe: it almost seemed reminiscent of carbonated water, except it's not carbonated at all. Anyway, the taste was fine, but I didn't find it unusually good; it was pretty clearly purified tap water (like Dasani), rather than spring water. The taste was better than Dasani, but not something that I'd pay extra for; I'm generally happy enough with the taste of tap water.So with an average taste and health benefits that could use some more research, this isn't something that I'm going to buy any time soon. Still, people with different health needs (particularly acid reflux) may find it helpful to them, and it will be interesting to see whether further research turns up any more relevant evidence.

Some of these teas were black teas, while others were green teas. Here are my thoughts on each of the six flavors:Fennel Spice (Green Tea) - This is the first flavor I tried. Fennel tastes reminiscent of licorice, so I thought it would be a safe try. After brewing this tea, I was a little hesistant to try it. It had a strong earthy scent, and I thought it would be too strong. Luckily, the taste of the tea was not earthy, but it was pleasant fennel taste (as one would expect). This tea would make a great base for a vegetable soup, but this one works well on its own too. My main complaint is just the smell. - 4/5 starsBeet Cabbage (Black Tea) - This one has a rich vibrant red color. The first thing that hit me with this tea was again, the smell. I shouldn't be surprised though, as cabbage has a notoriously strong scent. The scent was so bad, that I was tempted on to try the tea instead. Instead, I took a few small sips. This tea tastes the way it smells. I couldn't really taste beet, but I definitely tasted the cabbage. - 1/5 starsSpinach Chive (Green Tea) - Another horrible smell. At this point, I've decided that all of these will not have pleasant smell. It's not like vegetables are known for their wonderful smell. This one tasted okay. The spinach and chive was well balanced, but I'm not sure this would be a good tea to drink on its own, as it is a strong taste. - 3/5 starsTomato Mint (Black Tea) - Surprisingly, this one had a pleasant smell (just when I cad come to accept that these teas would not smell good). It smells like fresh mint and tomatoes, and I mean fresh, not like canned tomato or mint flavoring. I'm a huge fan of mint, and I like tomato soups/juices as well, but I've never had them together. Unfortunately I was a bit disappointed. The mint came off like tasting like toothpaste, and I couldn't get pass that.

It has whole-grain flakes that are made with brown sugar, and you can really taste the sugar.  This was a pleasant surprise.  The flakes are VERY hard, though...some might call it ""crunchy,"" but to me, it was unusual to have a flake that was resistant to being chewed!  This took a little getting used to...but at least the flake is tasty.There are also little bits of barley in the cereal, and this adds a nice psychological touch.

It has whole-grain flakes that are made with brown sugar, and you can really taste the sugar.  This was a pleasant surprise.  The flakes are VERY hard, though...some might call it ""crunchy,"" but to me, it was unusual to have a flake that was resistant to being chewed!

It always had a bitter aftertaste to me.  I have noticed over the years however that Lipton has been coming out with different and innovative flavors so I was happy to try this Blackberry Vanilla herbal tea.This is an herbal tea so it is caffeine free.  If you are looking for healing properties of teas such as green and black you won't get it here.  You WILL get a lovely blend of fruit and flower leaves for a relaxing hot beverage or a refreshing cold beverage morning, noon or night.Here are the ingredients in the order they are listed on the package:Hibiscus Flowers, Rosehips, Sweet Blackberry Leaves, Natural Flavor, Dried Black Current Pieces, Dried Blackberry Pieces, Dried Blueberry Pieces, Dried Raspberry Pieces, Sunflower Lecithin.The ingredients all sound nice and healthy except for the ""Natural Flavor"".  I have an issue with this term.  What exactly is ""Natural Flavor""?  According to the US Federal Code of Regulations it is this:""The term natural flavor or natural flavoring means the essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products therof, whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional"".So, I called Lipton and asked what exactly is the ""natural flavoring"" in this product.  The nice representative asked ""well, do you have an allergy to certain ingredients because if you tell me what you are allergic to I can see if I can find out?""  So, I said ""well, how about you just tell me what the natural ingredient is outright so I can just determine if that is the ingredient I should stay away from?""  The rep then asked me for the barcode on the package.  I gave it to her and she then answered ""According to the FDA""...  then proceeded to give me a statement similar to the US Federal Code of Regulations above.  I politely interrupted the rep and told her I was familiar with what the FDA defines as ""natural flavoring"" but that didn't help me to determine what specific ingredient could cause an allergic reaction.  She then said that I could get my doctor to send a letter on official doctor practice letterhead stating my known allergies and only then would the company disclose to my DOCTOR the source of the ""natural flavoring"".  Interesting yes?  So, keep that in mind with this product or any product that lists ""natural flavoring"" as an ingredient folks.I WAS happy however to see that Sunflower Lecithin is used instead of Soy Lecithin.  Soy Lecithin is full of GMO's and Sunflower (at this time) is not.  Its used in products as an emulsifier.  The other issue I have with the ingredient list is that Vanilla is not listed among them.  The tea is labeled as Blackberry AND Vanilla.  Where does the vanilla essence come from?Moving on from the ingredient list, lets talk about the tea bag.  The tea is packed in an innovative triangle shaped mesh bag.  The box states that this design is to provide more room for the fruit and herbs to infuse.  This might be true.  The tea did not need to steep nearly as long as the traditional flat papery bag.  However, the Triangle Mesh bag is made of plastic and is not biodegradable.  I asked Lipton about this as well and was told  ""The translucent Pyramid tea bag is made of PET, the same food grade material clear water and juice bottles are made of.  As with any plastic, it would not be considered biodegradable.  PET is completely safe and is 100% recyclable within the plastics waste stream.""  Great, so more plastic that will not decompose in our waste dumps.  Who is really going to empty out each of these bags and put them in your home recycle bin or take them to your local recycle facility?  Lipton is environmentally IRRESPONSIBLE!If you don't have an issue with any of what I addressed above then you will be happy to know that the tea itself is good.  If I didn't have an issue about the packaging or Natural Flavorings then I would give it 5 stars.  The flavor is deep and intense. The Berry flavor is predominant as is the Hibiscus but the Vanilla was difficult to ascertain.  It is good hot or cold.  I added some mulling spices to a hot cup last night and it was a very nice alternative to mulled apple cider or wine.I will be looking for different alternatives to this tea.  I won't give Lipton my money considering the issues I revealed here. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(4730, 4744)",3,0.0,False

According to the US Federal Code of Regulations it is this:""The term natural flavor or natural flavoring means the essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products therof, whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional"".So, I called Lipton and asked what exactly is the ""natural flavoring"" in this product.  The nice representative asked ""well, do you have an allergy to certain ingredients because if you tell me what you are allergic to I can see if I can find out?""  So, I said ""well, how about you just tell me what the natural ingredient is outright so I can just determine if that is the ingredient I should stay away from?""  The rep then asked me for the barcode on the package.  I gave it to her and she then answered ""According to the FDA""...  then proceeded to give me a statement similar to the US Federal Code of Regulations above.  I politely interrupted the rep and told her I was familiar with what the FDA defines as ""natural flavoring"" but that didn't help me to determine what specific ingredient could cause an allergic reaction.  She then said that I could get my doctor to send a letter on official doctor practice letterhead stating my known allergies and only then would the company disclose to my DOCTOR the source of the ""natural flavoring"".  Interesting yes?  So, keep that in mind with this product or any product that lists ""natural flavoring"" as an ingredient folks.I WAS happy however to see that Sunflower Lecithin is used instead of Soy Lecithin.  Soy Lecithin is full of GMO's and Sunflower (at this time) is not.  Its used in products as an emulsifier.  The other issue I have with the ingredient list is that Vanilla is not listed among them.  The tea is labeled as Blackberry AND Vanilla.  Where does the vanilla essence come from?Moving on from the ingredient list, lets talk about the tea bag.  The tea is packed in an innovative triangle shaped mesh bag.  The box states that this design is to provide more room for the fruit and herbs to infuse.  This might be true.  The tea did not need to steep nearly as long as the traditional flat papery bag.  However, the Triangle Mesh bag is made of plastic and is not biodegradable.  I asked Lipton about this as well and was told  ""The translucent Pyramid tea bag is made of PET, the same food grade material clear water and juice bottles are made of.  As with any plastic, it would not be considered biodegradable.  PET is completely safe and is 100% recyclable within the plastics waste stream.""  Great, so more plastic that will not decompose in our waste dumps.  Who is really going to empty out each of these bags and put them in your home recycle bin or take them to your local recycle facility?  Lipton is environmentally IRRESPONSIBLE!If you don't have an issue with any of what I addressed above then you will be happy to know that the tea itself is good.  If I didn't have an issue about the packaging or Natural Flavorings then I would give it 5 stars.  The flavor is deep and intense. The Berry flavor is predominant as is the Hibiscus but the Vanilla was difficult to ascertain.  It is good hot or cold.  I added some mulling spices to a hot cup last night and it was a very nice alternative to mulled apple cider or wine.I will be looking for different alternatives to this tea.  I won't give Lipton my money considering the issues I revealed here. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(4730, 4744)",1,0.0,False

I just wish it was a Fair Trade product since many producers sell organic which is the most common form of quinoa sold anywhere but a very limited Fair Trade organic quinoa and this certainly is not although a good quinoa. Prices of red quinoa has been going up to $10 a pound, which is the most expensive quinoa, than black, rainbow and yellow.KEEN-Waah... A complete protein source, a seed related to other healthy cousins like spinach and beets. In a pot I place quinoa, frozen peas, carrots, corn, add water and tomato paste. Spinach is added at the end the last minute. Stewing tomatoes for a half hour increases the cancer fighting lycopene content by 35 percent. Cooking also unlocks another nutrient, beta-carotene, in corn and carrots since heat breaks down the fibrous cell walls, releasing more of these antioxidants. The same goes for spinach but then you need to get your vitamin C from something else since that is the first vitamin which is depleted with heat. I saute lots of onion separately then in ten minutes I add paprika, cumin, dillweed, gram marsala, crushed red pepper, turmeric and lots of garlic2 x 2 Pound Fresh Garlic USA California Heirloom Monviso Gilroy Finest (4 Pounds Total), mix it well and add the mix to the pot and let it sit without heat for five minutes. This is what vegans consume instead of beef since it is a complete protein. Greens, vegetables, nuts, seeds, etc. may have protein but the fact is that only quinoa has a complete protein and all others do not since all others are missing few amino acids here and there but not quinoa. I rarely ever consume beef, chicken, etc. so fish and quinoa are the only source of complete protein with all amino acids for me. Organic, whole grain, very fulfilling due to some starch with host of vitamins, minerals that no beef or chicken can even come close to. Cooks in ten minutes with some water, no fat, no salt, no sugar... I consume it with eggplant, onions, okra, smoked hearings, curry type dishes with lots of spices and delicious juices. I never ever have to wash and rinse before cooking either. I keep the uncooked portions in double zip lock bags in freezer. I consume so much that I never have to worry about the unused portion going rancid and unlike brown rice which loses its oil in less than six months and becomes worthless even if kept in freezer, quinoa will last longer. Obviously I never ever do that with any food since I only purchase what I need in order to get the nutrients which are a healthy portion of my diet. Gluten free, the best product for me when I go camping since all I do is add lemon and tomato and that way I never have to worry about paying arm and leg for that lousy, awful tasting dry foods. I ground chia+flax+sesame, mix it with cocoa+isolate+soy milk before my workouts every single day or no workout regardless. Three tbsp of quinoa in my power drink offers me 4gr of pure, complete protein with all amino acids. I add organic paprika to regular yellow quinoa and it turns the dish into a beautiful red color. Healthy, healthier and healthiest of many seeds, delicious sprouts only in 3 days with all amino acids. I am an athlete with a healthy diet. I used to consume brown rice heavily years ago but no longer. I can consume quinoa with tomato and lemon juice and it is the best food I can take with me anywhere on any sports trip and I do not even have to wash it either. Delicious, delicious, delicious.FRESHNESS: Fresh means nutritious and delicious. I consume lots of seeds, beans, grains, vegetables, etc. and freshness is a priority regardless of the brand so I always purchase my food ingredients in small quantities from reputable sellers with high turnover. When fresh, food is nutritious and that goes for any food in any form, from frozen to canned. Fresh food is nutritious as well as delicious since nutrients give food its delicious taste. When old or rancid, nutrients are gone and any food item becomes an empty calories with no taste and absolutely worthless regardless of the brand or price, organic or conventional. For few years I consumed seeds in oil form since physicians advised me to do so not knowing that majority are not aware that seeds hardly offer any nutrients unless; seeds are fresh, not old which means rancid, not in oil form, not in supplement form, not hulled, ground and consumed within few days, kept in dark cold temperatures, away from light-sun-moisture since the oil in seeds and nuts go rancid regardless. That is why brown rice which has its nutrients will go rancid even if kept in freezer while white rice will last for years at room temperature since it hardly has any nutrients or oil. I ground in my coffee grinder sesame, flax, chia, amaranth, hemp then add cocoa, isolate protein, soy milk and consume it before my workouts on daily basis for its vitamins, minerals, protein and many nutrients, without much spike in my glucose. Un-hulled seeds are full of nutrients. I never consume hulled seeds which are empty calories, absolutely worthless since the nutrients have been removed.STARCH: Some carbohydrates, such as sugars and most starch are rapidly digested and absorbed as glucose into the body through the small intestine and subsequently used for short-term energy needs or stored. Resistant starch on the other hand, resists digestion and passes through to the large intestine where it acts like dietary fiber. Sugar, honey, maple syrup, white flour, white rice, whole-grain pastry flour, packaged cold cereals, commercial fruit juices, and fruit-juice sweetened beverages are the same foods some dentists claim rots the teeth from the inside out by changing the balance and ratio of calcium to phosphorous in the bloodstream. Your immune system goes down when you wolf down sweets, especially around events and holiday meals. High Glycemic foods quickly turn to sugar in your blood stream, causing excess insulin to pour into your blood to get rid of the excess sugar. The excess insulin pushes the calcium and fat into your arteries, especially if you have only a few cholesterol receptors on your liver (which is genetic). Whole wheat and white bread have essentially the same impact on blood sugar so I try to consume bread with whole sprouted grains, even flourless breads, and no-yeast breads. Black beans, northern beans, navy beans, red kidney beans, lentils, split peas, black-eyed peas, brown rice, rolled oats, millet, corn, black rice are all Resistance Starch. King of starch for me is quinoa and Navy Beans before and post expedition trips, 17.6gr vs. 15.4gr for 100gr serving. No wonder the price of quinoa is going up, up, up...

I saute lots of onion separately then in ten minutes I add paprika, cumin, dillweed, gram marsala, crushed red pepper, turmeric and lots of garlic2 x 2 Pound Fresh Garlic USA California Heirloom Monviso Gilroy Finest (4 Pounds Total), mix it well and add the mix to the pot and let it sit without heat for five minutes. This is what vegans consume instead of beef since it is a complete protein. Greens, vegetables, nuts, seeds, etc. may have protein but the fact is that only quinoa has a complete protein and all others do not since all others are missing few amino acids here and there but not quinoa. I rarely ever consume beef, chicken, etc. so fish and quinoa are the only source of complete protein with all amino acids for me. Organic, whole grain, very fulfilling due to some starch with host of vitamins, minerals that no beef or chicken can even come close to. Cooks in ten minutes with some water, no fat, no salt, no sugar... I consume it with eggplant, onions, okra, smoked hearings, curry type dishes with lots of spices and delicious juices. I never ever have to wash and rinse before cooking either. I keep the uncooked portions in double zip lock bags in freezer. I consume so much that I never have to worry about the unused portion going rancid and unlike brown rice which loses its oil in less than six months and becomes worthless even if kept in freezer, quinoa will last longer. Obviously I never ever do that with any food since I only purchase what I need in order to get the nutrients which are a healthy portion of my diet. Gluten free, the best product for me when I go camping since all I do is add lemon and tomato and that way I never have to worry about paying arm and leg for that lousy, awful tasting dry foods. I ground chia+flax+sesame, mix it with cocoa+isolate+soy milk before my workouts every single day or no workout regardless. Three tbsp of quinoa in my power drink offers me 4gr of pure, complete protein with all amino acids. I add organic paprika to regular yellow quinoa and it turns the dish into a beautiful red color. Healthy, healthier and healthiest of many seeds, delicious sprouts only in 3 days with all amino acids. I am an athlete with a healthy diet. I used to consume brown rice heavily years ago but no longer. I can consume quinoa with tomato and lemon juice and it is the best food I can take with me anywhere on any sports trip and I do not even have to wash it either. Delicious, delicious, delicious.FRESHNESS: Fresh means nutritious and delicious. I consume lots of seeds, beans, grains, vegetables, etc. and freshness is a priority regardless of the brand so I always purchase my food ingredients in small quantities from reputable sellers with high turnover. When fresh, food is nutritious and that goes for any food in any form, from frozen to canned. Fresh food is nutritious as well as delicious since nutrients give food its delicious taste. When old or rancid, nutrients are gone and any food item becomes an empty calories with no taste and absolutely worthless regardless of the brand or price, organic or conventional. For few years I consumed seeds in oil form since physicians advised me to do so not knowing that majority are not aware that seeds hardly offer any nutrients unless; seeds are fresh, not old which means rancid, not in oil form, not in supplement form, not hulled, ground and consumed within few days, kept in dark cold temperatures, away from light-sun-moisture since the oil in seeds and nuts go rancid regardless. That is why brown rice which has its nutrients will go rancid even if kept in freezer while white rice will last for years at room temperature since it hardly has any nutrients or oil. I ground in my coffee grinder sesame, flax, chia, amaranth, hemp then add cocoa, isolate protein, soy milk and consume it before my workouts on daily basis for its vitamins, minerals, protein and many nutrients, without much spike in my glucose. Un-hulled seeds are full of nutrients. I never consume hulled seeds which are empty calories, absolutely worthless since the nutrients have been removed.STARCH: Some carbohydrates, such as sugars and most starch are rapidly digested and absorbed as glucose into the body through the small intestine and subsequently used for short-term energy needs or stored. Resistant starch on the other hand, resists digestion and passes through to the large intestine where it acts like dietary fiber. Sugar, honey, maple syrup, white flour, white rice, whole-grain pastry flour, packaged cold cereals, commercial fruit juices, and fruit-juice sweetened beverages are the same foods some dentists claim rots the teeth from the inside out by changing the balance and ratio of calcium to phosphorous in the bloodstream. Your immune system goes down when you wolf down sweets, especially around events and holiday meals. High Glycemic foods quickly turn to sugar in your blood stream, causing excess insulin to pour into your blood to get rid of the excess sugar. The excess insulin pushes the calcium and fat into your arteries, especially if you have only a few cholesterol receptors on your liver (which is genetic). Whole wheat and white bread have essentially the same impact on blood sugar so I try to consume bread with whole sprouted grains, even flourless breads, and no-yeast breads. Black beans, northern beans, navy beans, red kidney beans, lentils, split peas, black-eyed peas, brown rice, rolled oats, millet, corn, black rice are all Resistance Starch. King of starch for me is quinoa and Navy Beans before and post expedition trips, 17.6gr vs. 15.4gr for 100gr serving. No wonder the price of quinoa is going up, up, up...

It is not important if the oil or the tablet is even frozen at the time of production till you consume since any seed, and I mean any type of seed regardless of the brand will go rancid once ground and cracked open since the shell, the protection is removed which will allow air and moisture access the oil of the seed much quicker than when the seed is in a complete un-hulled form. The best example of rancidity is brown rice. Place some brown rice in freezer and you will notice in few months it will not even cook since the oils have gone rancid even if it was kept in a sealed container in the freezer regardless. Chia is the only seed that does not need to be ground in order for human body to digest and get the nutrients and can be stored for longer time than any other seed without going rancid. Sesame seed, flax seed, etc. are so dense that will pass through human body when not ground making it absolutely worthless since human body can not digest it in its natural form.FIBER: Fiber is essential for body since fiber absorbs the unwanted liquid in the gut and body has to defecate that blown up fiber which in return lowers cholesterol, glucose, blood pressure, etc. and brings comfort and efficiency to human body unlike fat which stays in human body unless needed for energy. Flax is high in fiber.MINERALS: Flax is one of the kings of nutrients when it comes to minerals and so important to me as a whole delicious seed; highest ALA, high magnesium, high potassium, calcium with the healthiest fat.Accordingly for 100gr servings size of;SESAME__FLAX__CHIA__AMARANTH__QUINOA__HEMP__PISTACHIO__ALMOND__CASHEW__PEANUTCALORIES565__534__490__371__368__567__557__575__553__585SAT FAT34__18__16__7__4__17__27__19__39__34CALCIUM99__26__63__16__5__0__11__26__4__5MAGNESIUM89__98__0__62__49__167__30__67__73__44POTASSIUM14__23__5__15__16__167__29__20__19__19ZINC48__29__23__19__21__83__15__21__39__22FIBER47__109__151__8__11__4 __41__49__13__32PHYTOSTEROLS714__0__0__0__0__N/A__214__0__0__0FRESHNESS: Fresh means nutritious and delicious.

That is why brown rice which has its nutrients will go rancid even if kept in freezer while white rice will last for years at room temperature since it hardly has any nutrients or oil. I ground in my coffee grinder sesame, flax, chia, amaranth, hemp then add cocoa, isolate protein, soy milk and consume it before my workouts on daily basis for its vitamins, minerals, protein and many nutrients, without much spike in my glucose.

That is true for any brand of flaxseed regardless if such flaxseed oil is in solid form, oil form in a bottle or in a capsule form.

It is not important if the oil or the tablet is even frozen at the time of production till you consume since any seed, and I mean any type of seed regardless of the brand will go rancid once ground and cracked open since the shell, the protection is removed which will allow air and moisture access the oil of the seed much quicker than when the seed is in a complete un-hulled form. The best example of rancidity is brown rice. Place some brown rice in freezer and you will notice in few months it will not even cook since the oils have gone rancid even if it was kept in a sealed container in the freezer regardless. Chia is the only seed that does not need to be ground in order for human body to digest and get the nutrients and can be stored for longer time than any other seed without going rancid. Sesame seed, flax seed, etc. are so dense that will pass through human body when not ground making it absolutely worthless since human body can not digest it in its natural form.FIBER: Fiber is essential for body since fiber absorbs the unwanted liquid in the gut and body has to defecate that blown up fiber which in return lowers cholesterol, glucose, blood pressure, etc. and brings comfort and efficiency to human body unlike fat which stays in human body unless needed for energy. Flax is high in fiber.MINERALS: Flax is one of the kings of nutrients when it comes to minerals and so important to me as a whole delicious seed; highest ALA, high magnesium, high potassium, calcium with the healthiest fat.Accordingly for 100gr servings size of;SESAME__FLAX__CHIA__AMARANTH__QUINOA__HEMP__PISTACHIO__ALMOND__CASHEW__PEANUTCALORIES565__534__490__371__368__567__557__575__553__585SAT FAT34__18__16__7__4__17__27__19__39__34CALCIUM99__26__63__16__5__0__11__26__4__5MAGNESIUM89__98__0__62__49__167__30__67__73__44POTASSIUM14__23__5__15__16__167__29__20__19__19ZINC48__29__23__19__21__83__15__21__39__22FIBER47__109__151__8__11__4 __41__49__13__32PHYTOSTEROLS714__0__0__0__0__N/A__214__0__0__0FRESHNESS: Fresh means nutritious and delicious. I consume lots of seeds, beans, grains, vegetables, etc. and freshness is a priority regardless of the brand so I always purchase my food ingredients in small quantities from reputable sellers with high turnover. When fresh, food is nutritious and that goes for any food in any form, from frozen to canned. Fresh food is nutritious as well as delicious since nutrients give food its delicious taste. When old or rancid, nutrients are gone and any food item becomes an empty calories with no taste and absolutely worthless regardless of the brand or price, organic or conventional. For few years I consumed seeds in oil form since physicians advised me to do so not knowing that majority are not aware that seeds hardly offer any nutrients unless; seeds are fresh, not old which means rancid, not in oil form, not in supplement form, not hulled, ground and consumed within few days, kept in dark cold temperatures, away from light-sun-moisture since the oil in seeds and nuts go rancid regardless. That is why brown rice which has its nutrients will go rancid even if kept in freezer while white rice will last for years at room temperature since it hardly has any nutrients or oil. I ground in my coffee grinder sesame, flax, chia, amaranth, hemp then add cocoa, isolate protein, soy milk and consume it before my workouts on daily basis for its vitamins, minerals, protein and many nutrients, without much spike in my glucose. Un-hulled seeds are full of nutrients.

I have to admit that it's a very good coffee as far as flavored coffees go.  The scent of the vanilla intertwined with the coffee hits you before you even open the bag, but do not use that as a device of judgement until after you've brewed a few cups of this coffee.As I've already said, the smell of vanilla is strong, but the actual vanilla flavor is very slight.  In fact, the vanilla is very hard to taste at all.I decided to brew this coffee in two separate ways:  1) Per the instructions on the bag (two tablespoons per six ounces of water) and 2) By my normal method (three tablespoons per six ounces of water).After brewing the coffee, I drank each brewed cup in three different ways:  1) black (which is my normal method of drinking coffee), 2) with one teaspoon of cream and one teaspoon of sugar, and 3) with two teaspoons of cream and two teaspoons of sugar.What I immediately noticed was that the bag's brewing instructions suited my personal taste best.  My normal brewing method made the coffee stronger (as I like it), but didn't alter the taste at all.When I drank the coffee black in both brewing cases, I noticed almost no difference in the taste, although the coffee's body was a bit heavier in the second brewing method.  The vanilla flavor was miniscule.With one teaspoon of cream and one teaspoon of sugar, I found that the vanilla flavor stood out a bit more, but was still fairly weak.  The overall taste of the coffee was good, though.With two teaspoons of cream and sugar, the vanilla came into its own a bit more, but could not overtake the coffee's taste itself.Overall, this is a coffee drinker's flavored coffee.  If you want a fuller, sweeter vanilla taste and less coffee taste, look elsewhere.  If you only drink flavored coffees as a treat but prefer the taste of medium to dark roast coffee alone, this brew will be right up your alley.I personally enjoyed this coffee, and plan to buy more of it soon.

Why so? First I love the taste. It reminds me of the days when I was young drinking Boones Farm Apple wine on a Friday night. Some may prefer, or liken it to champagne.I'm on a diet, lost the first 10 pounds in 12 days. It is a simple diet, eat as much natural fruit, and vegetables, and salads as I want, and limit my sandwiches at lunch to whole grain bread with lean meats, like chicken, fish, or Boka/Morning Star (soy) burgers, and the same type of meat entree at night for dinner on top of a pile of steamed veggies, and Olive Oil. Yeah lots of olive oil. (Not to excess though) My sandwiches, and dinner's meats/steamed veggies always enjoy piles of saut&eacute;ed onions, bell pepper, etc. to put on top of them. You could say that it is not a fast, but rather a feast. One of the key ingredients is I have all the fruit I want. At night time if I get hungry, I will eat a whole small jar of natural apple sauce. No sugar added. Oh, and I drink plenty of water. Eight glasses a day? Probably, I don't measure; I just walk around with a large plastic mug, filled with water, and sip all day long.So what does all of this have to do with the IZZE sparkling apple? Namely this. It is a special treat.I would not call it diet food, because in order for fruit to be dietetic, it must be in its natural state. It can be cut into chunks, and fresh frozen, and blended into smoothies, which is my preferred method; eliminates spoilage, and adds to the fun. But you have to avoid concentrating it, thereby increasing the sugar content. In this case, it is from concentrate, but then they add sparkling water. So it is kind of teetering on the fence. That is why I call it a special treat.So for those who may not agree with my dieting methods, or the fact that I easily drop 20 pounds in the spring, and have been doing it for well over 25 years, (Yes I have lost over 500 pounds in my lifetime) and are more interested in having a good time, let's talk about the Wow factor.This stuff tastes great. I quit drinking some 10 years ago, but this is an opportunity to live it up. Whenever I open a can of Izze, it is like a celebration. By the way, I am talking about the apple, and am curious about the other flavors as well. One thing is certain, I will be purchaing more of this when my current case runs out.When dieting, the big enemy is cane sugar, which is fattening. Fruit sugar in its natural state is immediately absorbed by the body, and does not convert to fat readily the way cane sugar does. (All I know is when I eat cane sugar I immediately gain weight, and when I eat all the fruit I want, I lose it)If you are looking to break the canned soda habit, Izze is the way to go. Canned soda has some ungodly amount of cane sugar in it.Another interesting factoid, according to Dr Weil M.D., the nutritional, and natural healing guru, the main benefit from drinking wine is not in the alcohol, but in the grapes. By getting Izze apple, the primary ingredient is grape juice, then apple, etc. So help your heart, or arteries, or whatever they espouse about the benefits of drinking wine, and get some Izze. I'm sold. Once you taste it, many will be too.I think the Izze people are really on to something here. Highly recommended.

I first tried this when I obtained a few complimentary bags.On the matter of taste, I find it very good. The Bigelow EG appeared to be very strong in color and taste.Tea bag teas are usually cut very fine so the bags can be packed flat, and because finely cut leaves have more surface area than big leaves, you don't need to steep the tea as long. In fact the instructions say to steep only 1-2 minutes as opposed to the usual 3-4 mins.To me, Earl Grey taste has two components, the tea taste and the bergamot taste, and it takes a lot of skill to blend and make a tea that has a pleasing combination of the two tastes.For example, I've found that Taylors and Harrogate has a mild tea and bergamot taste, Whole Foods loose leaf has a strong bergamot taste, etc. Your run of the mill EG usually has a strong tea taste that overshadows the bergamot and you don't taste it at all. Bigelow has a very strong tea taste, but it doesn't overwhelm the bergamot, which you taste at the end. So I like it very much because I've never had a strong tea that didn't overwhelm the bergamot.

I use the cream to doctor-it-up in hopes of salvaging some of the flavor and masking the poor aspects whether caused by bitterness or coffee that's been sitting in the pot too long.  This coffee is no exception, the cream vastly improved the drinkability, but the action is akin to smearing butter on a day old roll. Underneath it is still a stale roll, and although the butter tastes delicious, it would not be accurate to call the combination a buttery delight.On the positive side, flavored coffees are usually light body and the Gevalia is definitely medium body. The packaging is quite attractive and the name is clever, but in the end may work against the product because Dark Chocolate Truffle evokes a clear taste profile for most people and the coffee doesn't live up to the name. I am rating the coffee three stars instead of less because if the purchaser always uses cream in their coffee, many of the taste issues I encountered should be if not resolved, at least mitigated.

And of course it's great at night because it doesn't have caffeine to keep you up.I recommend everybody and anybody to try this tea. It is yummy.

More details follow...PACKAGING:(Note - I received this product through the Vine program and it is possible that packaging will change between the review version and final launch.)The outer wrap is a relatively standard Chips Ahoy pack.  Opening it involves lifting a tab on the front, which reveals three rows of cookies.  While the cookies in my package were intact, I was initially shocked by how much air is in the package.  Nabisco clearly re-used the tray from other cookie products, and these cookies do not fill the space.  As such, they're probably prone to bounce around and crumble if treated poorly in shipment.  The package can be re-sealed by pressing the flap back down and running a finger along the edge to adhere.  The cookies didn't last long enough for me to judge whether the package truly prevents the cookies from becoming stale.  The seal seems a little looser than I'd like.VISUAL IMPRESSION:The cookies look kind of shabby, to be honest.  They don't look like they'd be very chocolaty.  Also, the smaller size is quite striking if you're used to the size of a standard Chips Ahoy.  (This smaller size likely accounts for the large amount of airspace in the packaging.)FLAVOR:I was blown away by the taste of these.  While there is a slight chemical taste, it is the same chemical taste found in any soft-style packaged cookie.  The chemical taste is quickly replaced by an explosion of chocolate.  One guest I shared these with noted that the cookie tasted a S'more minus the marshmallow. (Idea for Nabisco: S'more flavor!)  I was initially concerned that the cookie would be too sweet, but the chocolate filling is kind of dark and semi-sweet which compliments the cookie perfectly.  The cookies are also quite rich, and I found myself satisfied after a smaller quantity of cookies than normal.NUTRITION:Well, it's a cookie.  You shouldn't be expecting a health food here.  It's 150 calories per serving, and a serving is roughly 2 cookies.  That seems fairly calorie-dense to me, but your perception may vary. Each serving has 21g of carbs, with 13g of those coming from sugar.  There's no trans-fats, and the ingredients list sugar, not HFCS, as the main sweetening ingredient.QUANTITY/VALUE:At $4.32 a package, that's roughly 24-28 cents a cookie or around 50-56 cents a serving (2 cookies).

Something happened with this mix, because I came away with an artificial aftertaste.  If you prefer more of a black tea taste in you iced tea, add an extra Lipton orange pekoe bag.  A perfect combination.Overall, a good product for warm weather drinking, excellent iced and the tart flavor hits the right spot. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(972, 986)",1,0.0,False

Initially I was reluctant to accept the product, only because I really have never used it and wasn't sure what to do with it.  Much to my surprise, the question now seems to be: ""What can't you do with coconut oil?""A quick online search will give you articles outlining hundreds of potential uses for this product.  I found that a bit overwhelming, so I stuck to the ones I'd look to the most: cooking, hair and skin care.COOKING:I tasted it out of the jar first.  Very pleasant. Light 'toasted' coconut flavor, with the consistency being smooth and light, despite the semi-hard consistency at room temperature.I used this product in both a shrimp stir-fry (about 1 Tablespoon melted before throwing in the ingredents), and it imparted a very nice coconut flavor to the dish.  Then I used it in place of Crisco in a cookie recipe, and loved the way the cookies turned out!  They too had a coconut flavor, but very light.  I'm sure the intensity of the coconut oil used has something to do with it, as does the amount used in a recipe.HAIR CARE:In place ofMogador Certified Organic 100% Pure Argan Oil 2 fl. oz (60 mL)I used a small bit of coconut oil (melted).  I rubbed it between my hands and lightly went over the ends of my hair, being careful not to go to the scalp or use too much.  I found I enjoyed the scent, but despite adding a nice sheen, it seems a bit too oily to me for use in this way.  I think it's a matter of when the oil is applied and using less than you think you'll need, to get the desired effects for smoothing and luster.SKIN CARE:I put this on my hands and elbows at night.  I've noticed a nice change in the way both feel - moisturized and smoother - after about 3 days. I've also used it as a night-time facial moisturizer.  I note that it does go on slightly greasy, but by morning that greasiness is gone.  I've had no break outs of acne or similar, when using it in this way, but people with oily or combination skin may want to avoid using this product for a facial moisturizer as it is oil based. Consistent use on dry skin however, may eliminate dry patches and cracked skin.Overall, I'm very impressed with the quality of this product.  The price is on par with others in the marketplace, and it's organically certified, which gives me peace of mind about using it.I really like Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, and I look forward to discovering new ways to use this product. I plan on investigating its dietary benefits a bit more to see if it would be beneficial to me (having high cholesterol) to add this to my routine. *Due to the high saturated fat content, I have not yet felt comfortable ingesting it on a daily basis until consulting with my physician.  Although it does not have any trans fats, which is a good thing!UPDATE:  10/18/13 - NEW USESI've added to my usage of this product: massage oil.  It smells wonderful and works great!  Because it doesn't absorb quickly into the skin, and you need very little, which emulsifies quickly - it's nearly perfect for this use.And hair conditioner... put on small amount on bottom half of your hair (not at the roots) when dry, leave on for 1/2 hour and then shower, shampoo and condition your hair as usual.

These days you can barely get a cup of coffee somewhere without someone dumping sugar into it without asking.  So along comes Illy's ready-to-drink ""espresso-style"" coffee and I imagine I should have guessed that it would be sweetened.  I didn't.  It was an unpleasant shock,not only because I hate sugar in my coffee, but because you have to check the ingredient list to find the sugar.

I've always liked Illy coffee and this brewed stuff isn't half bad for something that comes out of a can.  I think I'd prefer it from a glass bottle, but what are the odds of that happening? As it is, the flavor of the can isn't a huge problem, but it sure doesn't add anything to the experience.Tiny can doesn't go very far either.

This isn't a tiny cup of hot espresso we're talking about, it's a cold beverage.

However, the cookies themselves are relatively small (just slightly larger than a Thin Mint or Oreo in diameter), and I/we did note a chemical taste not unlike that found inChips Ahoy Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies.  You'll go through a package quickly both because of the deliciousness and that you really only get 15-18 relatively small cookies.  More details follow...PACKAGING:(Note - I received this product through the Vine program and it is possible that packaging will change between the review version and final launch.)The outer wrap is a relatively standard Chips Ahoy pack.  Opening it involves lifting a tab on the front, which reveals three rows of cookies.  While the cookies in my package were intact, I was initially shocked by how much air is in the package.  Nabisco clearly re-used the tray from other cookie products, and these cookies do not fill the space.  As such, they're probably prone to bounce around and crumble if treated poorly in shipment.  The package can be re-sealed by pressing the flap back down and running a finger along the edge to adhere.  The cookies didn't last long enough for me to judge whether the package truly prevents the cookies from becoming stale.  The seal seems a little looser than I'd like.VISUAL IMPRESSION:The cookies look kind of shabby, to be honest.  They don't look like they'd be very chocolaty.  Also, the smaller size is quite striking if you're used to the size of a standard Chips Ahoy.  (This smaller size likely accounts for the large amount of airspace in the packaging.)FLAVOR:I was blown away by the taste of these.  While there is a slight chemical taste, it is the same chemical taste found in any soft-style packaged cookie.  The chemical taste is quickly replaced by an explosion of chocolate.  One guest I shared these with noted that the cookie tasted a S'more minus the marshmallow. (Idea for Nabisco: S'more flavor!)  I was initially concerned that the cookie would be too sweet, but the chocolate filling is kind of dark and semi-sweet which compliments the cookie perfectly.  The cookies are also quite rich, and I found myself satisfied after a smaller quantity of cookies than normal.NUTRITION:Well, it's a cookie.  You shouldn't be expecting a health food here.  It's 150 calories per serving, and a serving is roughly 2 cookies.  That seems fairly calorie-dense to me, but your perception may vary. Each serving has 21g of carbs, with 13g of those coming from sugar.  There's no trans-fats, and the ingredients list sugar, not HFCS, as the main sweetening ingredient.QUANTITY/VALUE:At $4.32 a package, that's roughly 24-28 cents a cookie or around 50-56 cents a serving (2 cookies).  While I didn't pay for this product directly, I have to say that I would not pay over $4 per package for these given the low quantity of cookies.  I'd watch for a sale or lower price.

In a third pan (or in the one you boiled the pasta in), grate or cube about a pound of Velveeta and heat it gently with a 2 tbsp of butter, stirring frequently until melted, then add about 1/4 to 1/2 cup cream a little at a time while stirring. Add a little white pepper and 1/8 tsp nutmeg, if you like it. Or use sour cream instead of whole cream, or put a little beef broth into the beef after it has browned.Now combine the cheese sauce, the pasta (use more or less to taste, the beef (please don't drain it unless you are on a low fat diet, and then do so carefully - if you have one of those old fat brushes, use that, try to save the juices).  Then add a whole can of Ro-Tel, to your family's taste, hot, mild, lime-chili, whatever.  Taste it - and if it is bland, fix it.Dust the top with paprika before serving it.This dish will taste good, and it won't take you much longer to make it than it would to start with this mix.  And if it is bland, you have only yourself to blame.  You can put more or less salt, pepper, herbs, and whatever - you don't need to use a mix to make a cheese/macaroni/beef dish.  This stuff really isn't that hard.Now, there is nothing wrong with Velveeta.  It melts nicely, it makes a great cheese sauce.  It usually has some flavor.  And there is nothing wrong with this stuff except that it is just tasteless, and almost anyone can do better.  Seriously, YOU can do better than this bland product.  If you like Velveeta, use it. If you don't like Velveeta, well, making it yourself allows you to make your cheese sauce from a different type of cheese.  Mexican melting cheese is good.

And if it is bland, you have only yourself to blame.  You can put more or less salt, pepper, herbs, and whatever - you don't need to use a mix to make a cheese/macaroni/beef dish.  This stuff really isn't that hard.Now, there is nothing wrong with Velveeta.  It melts nicely, it makes a great cheese sauce.  It usually has some flavor.

Some recipes just need sugar, and we normally use Xylitol for those. But we're always looking for safer alternatives, so I gave Nectresse a try.The ingredients listed on the package (in order from highest quantity to least) are erythritol (a sugar alcohol or polyol that Wikipedia says ""does not affect blood sugar, does not cause tooth decay""); sugar; monk fruit extract; and molasses. Wikipedia further says that ""When compared with other sugar alcohols, it [erythritol] is also much more difficult for intestinal bacteria to digest, so is less likely to cause gas or bloating than other polyols, such as maltitol, sorbitol."" Less gas and bloating is a good thing!I was concerned about how much ""sugar"" was in the product, so I called the folks at Nectresse. They couldn't tell me the exact amount, of course ... trade secrets and all that ... but they said it was ""minimal"". I asked specifically about diabetes, since that wasn't mentioned anywhere on their website. The person I spoke to said that Nectress is ""diabetic friendly"", and that up to two packets a day coounts as ""free"". I also asked about using Nectresse in baking, since most alternative sugars don't react with yeast. She confirmed that you can't use Nectress alone in any baking that requires the dough or batter to rise, but that using a tablespoon or two of ""real sugar"" would work. We do very little baking, so I haven't had a chance to try that yet.As far as ""I can't believe it's not sugar!"" - you can believe it. You can tell that Nectress isn't ""regualr sugar"". It has a slight fruity aftertaste, which is not surprising given the monk fruit extract. Turning to Wikipedia again, I found that monk fruit is a perennial vine native to Asia, and that ""The fruit extract is nearly 300 times sweeter than sugar and has been used as a natural low-calorie sweetener in China for nearly a millennium to treat diabetes and obesity.""We don't mind the aftertaste, and found that it wasn't really noticable in cooking, or in coffee or tea. We've lost a lot of our ""sweet tooth"" since going on the diabetic diet, so I generally only use about a third of a packet in my drinks. A full packet of any kind of sugar just tastes way to sweet any more.If you're looking for alternatives to high-fructose sugar and artificial sweetners, you should give Nectresse a try.

Wikipedia further says that ""When compared with other sugar alcohols, it [erythritol] is also much more difficult for intestinal bacteria to digest, so is less likely to cause gas or bloating than other polyols, such as maltitol, sorbitol."" Less gas and bloating is a good thing!I was concerned about how much ""sugar"" was in the product, so I called the folks at Nectresse. They couldn't tell me the exact amount, of course ... trade secrets and all that ... but they said it was ""minimal"". I asked specifically about diabetes, since that wasn't mentioned anywhere on their website. The person I spoke to said that Nectress is ""diabetic friendly"", and that up to two packets a day coounts as ""free"". I also asked about using Nectresse in baking, since most alternative sugars don't react with yeast. She confirmed that you can't use Nectress alone in any baking that requires the dough or batter to rise, but that using a tablespoon or two of ""real sugar"" would work. We do very little baking, so I haven't had a chance to try that yet.As far as ""I can't believe it's not sugar!"" - you can believe it. You can tell that Nectress isn't ""regualr sugar"". It has a slight fruity aftertaste, which is not surprising given the monk fruit extract. Turning to Wikipedia again, I found that monk fruit is a perennial vine native to Asia, and that ""The fruit extract is nearly 300 times sweeter than sugar and has been used as a natural low-calorie sweetener in China for nearly a millennium to treat diabetes and obesity.""We don't mind the aftertaste, and found that it wasn't really noticable in cooking, or in coffee or tea. We've lost a lot of our ""sweet tooth"" since going on the diabetic diet, so I generally only use about a third of a packet in my drinks. A full packet of any kind of sugar just tastes way to sweet any more.If you're looking for alternatives to high-fructose sugar and artificial sweetners, you should give Nectresse a try.

But the truth is, I really didn't like them that much.Oh sure, they are chocolate, and that's really never a bad thing!  But these are just too much for my tastes.  The description is accurate:  they are chewy, they are gooey, they are chocofudge.  Basically, they are the Chips Ahoy chewy chocolate chip cookies, slit open and filled with gooey fudge in the middle.Not bad - just WAY too far over the top for my taste.

The salmon spread does taste like salmon, which is great, and the lime and chili complement it well. It's just a tad spicy, so mild that I didn't even notice it until I was well into eating it. I liked the slight kick, and it shouldn't bother people with sensative tongues. The crackers are organic, but you wouldn't know it. They're crunchy and buttery, kind of like Ritz crackers. My favorite item was the fruit and nut mix. They were salty and sweet, and the ginger went so well with the nuts peanuts and cranberries. It had a slight kick, no more than the salmon spread, and this was a great complement. The chocolate was ok. If you've had organic chocolate before, you know what to expect. It wasn't very sweet at 60% cacao, and it wasn't very smooth. Not really my thing, but eh. The only thing I didn't really like was the dried edamame.

I like a good cup of black coffee but am not fanatical about it. I do grind fresh bold or medium body beans each morning and use filtered water to prepare the pot.As someone who usually adds a little espresso or instant espresso powder to most chocolate recipes I know this flavor combination is a wonderful marriage. Depending on the percentage of espresso to chocolate, the result is either a deep mocha flavor with the coffee playing a major role, or a small addition will result in complex chocolate flavor with no obvious coffee component.  Unfortunately, with the Gevalia Dark Chocolate Truffle coffee the merger of coffee and chocolate adversely affected both the coffee and the chocolate flavor.There is a definite aftertaste from the artificial flavor, and the coffee itself is bitter and acidic. I do not know if the artificial flavor affected the coffee or the coffee is bitter and acidic on its own but, after each sip I had an involuntary puckering reaction, not my lips, but the inside of my cheeks as if I was consuming something containing acetic acid, like vinegar, not that it tasted like vinegar - it didn't.  The flavor was remarkably unpleasant, and when the cup cooled off, it tasted worse. Even the aroma while brewing smelled artificial.The other reviewers who mention how greatly improved the flavor became once cream was added is an indication of a consistent problem.  I love the taste of coffee and like it unadorned - no cream or sugar. I only add cream if I am in a restaurant and the coffee doesn't taste good. I use the cream to doctor-it-up in hopes of salvaging some of the flavor and masking the poor aspects whether caused by bitterness or coffee that's been sitting in the pot too long.  This coffee is no exception, the cream vastly improved the drinkability, but the action is akin to smearing butter on a day old roll. Underneath it is still a stale roll, and although the butter tastes delicious, it would not be accurate to call the combination a buttery delight.On the positive side, flavored coffees are usually light body and the Gevalia is definitely medium body. The packaging is quite attractive and the name is clever, but in the end may work against the product because Dark Chocolate Truffle evokes a clear taste profile for most people and the coffee doesn't live up to the name.

I happen to like black cherry as a flavor for beverages, so keep that in mind as you read this review.FLAVOR:The beverage was sweet, but not overly sweet, and not at all tart.  It tasted similar to other black cherry carbonated drinks I've had.  I would compare it in taste to Knudsen's Black Cherry Spritzer with Switch being a tad more ""soda"" tasting.  It is much lighter tasting than actual black cherry sodas I've had, such as Dr. Brown's.INGREDIENTS:The Switch is advertised as 100% juice.  It is, but it is juice from concentrate.  I prefer juice squeezed from the fruit or vegetable itself.  In the case of The Switch the concentrate is filtered sparkling water.  I'm fine drinking concentrates and I drink soda too so I'm not being a health fanatic, but be aware if you are expecting actual juice, this product is filtered water used to reconstitute the juice concentrate.  The juices uses are apple, grape, acerola and cherry.  If you aren't familiar with acerola, it is a cherry like fruit, but with three lobes.  Acerola is high in Vitamin C.NUTRITION:One 8.3 ounce can of The Switch Black Cherry contains:* 130 calories* 15 mg sodium*35 g carbs (33 g sugar)So keep in mind while it has no added sugar it still has the sugar content from its ingredients.  It has more calories than a can of Coke Classic!  It does not have any corn syrup or added sugars though.It also contains 100% of the recommended level of Vitamin C.PRICE:The product costs more than soda, but the ingredients are better.  It costs a little less than Knudsen's Black Cherry Spritzer product.  I use this comparison because the Knudsen product is similar in taste and basic content (filtered sparkling water, fruit concentrate), but a little different in ingredients (no acerola, using pear, pineapple and plum instead), with The Switch having a slight bit more carbs and sugars.Overall, this is a tasty drink.  It is somewhere between a soda and a health drink, definitely better for you than a soda, but not quite as ""natural"" as say all natural juices.

I like the list of ingredients and like that it has a lot of real dried pieces of real dried fruit to enhance the flavor.  Although the box says that one cup of tea is not a significant source of vitamins, minerals, or nutrients, I notice that many of the ingredients are known for some vitamin C and suspect one is getting some very low dose of good vitamin C and some cofactors for absorbing it (and a little bit of choline from the sunflower lecithin to build a little acetyl choline in the brain).  I assume that the ""natural flavor"" is vanillin, because vanilla is mentioned as a flavor on the package but is not found in its herbal form in the ingredients.  I personally do not like ""natural flavor"" as a ingredient, because MSG can hide under this label.  I do not suspect that MSG is in this brew, but I am never quite sure what is actually hiding behind the label ""natural flavor"" and would rather have a fuller disclosure instead.  I found the taste pleasant and can taste the fruit flavors and the vanillin.  I suspect it would make a good iced tea, but only tasted it as a hot tea.I really liked the pyramid tea bags!

I think that Lipton is really on to something with this kind of tea bag.I found the flavor pleasant and enjoyable.  I usually sweeten my teas with stevia (sugar free naturally sweet healing herb).  There is nothing too earth shaking about the taste, but I did find something I liked about the tea.  It seems to work very well when mixed with other herbal teas and does enhance the flavor of a green tea without overpowering the flavor of green tea.  As a support tea, I found these tea bags to be very good.  By themselves, they are okay.  I realize that some might want to get this tea because it is a no caffeine one, but it does work well with green tea (which is caffeinated).

My mother runs the supplements department of a huge health food store.  I have tasted dozens of health food bars.  Most I wouldn't even consider health food because they are filled with highly-processed extracts of whole foods, such as soy protein (which most people are allergic to).  Even organic food bars are filled with unwholesome ingredients that I would never put into my body.  So I am alway eager to try an organic food bar with an ingredient list short enough to memorize.INGREDIENTSIn a single word - EXCEPTIONAL.  In the market of food bars, this bar is at the top (alongside a few others which I will list below).  Minimal ingredients, all organic, no added sugar, no added thickening agents.  Just nuts and fruits, with a little bit of added organic oil.  Great!  5 stars all the way!TASTEWhen it comes to food, taste is often the deciding factor  (when it really should be ingredients because our taste buds will change very quickly once we stop ingesting super sugary or super salty foods).  Unfortunately most people will rank this bar as mediocre in the taste department. Most people eat far too much sugar and salt in their diet, so any natural foods will taste bland and uninteresting.  For me, however, my taste buds enjoyed the balanced flavor of almond, cashew, blueberry, and date in this bar.  I give it 4 stars for flavor.  It is good, but falls just short of delicious.So there you have it.. a healthy alternative to other food bars out there.  A good natural flavor that is not too sweet.  When you just can't take a cooked me with you to work or on the road, this food bar is a good choice.Overall, I give this bar 5 stars.  5 for ingredients, 4 for flavor, and that extra 1/2 point because making great tasting organic food bars with clean ingredients is so darn difficult.OTHER RECOMMENDATIONSLike I said, I have much experience in the health food world and I love passing on good information when I have it.  So here are my other recommendations for organic food bars.  I purposefully did not include most of the well-known food bars - they are so filled with processed ingredients, indigestible filler ingredients, and sugar that I would never put them in my body.1) Raw Organic Food Bar.  Yup, that's the actual brand name.  They make great bars with ingredients very similar to this bar.  The difference is Raw Organic Food Bars are more oily and sweet.  These are my personal favorites.  They have many flavors, so try a few to find your favorites.  Raw Organic Food Bar, Chocolate Coconut, 1.76-Ounce Bars(Pack of 12), Raw Organic Food Bar, Chocolatey Chocolate Chip, 1.76-Ounce Bars(Pack of 12), Raw Organic Food Bar, Fiber Chocolate Delite, 1.76-Ounce Bars(Pack of 12), Raw Organic Food Bar, Cinnamon Raisin, 1.76-Ounce Bars(Pack of 12)2) Raw Revolution Organic Live Food Bars.  These bars only contain only 3-5 ingredients per bar and everything is raw.  These bars are good as well - more flavor than the Pure Bar, but too sweet or chocolaty sometimes.Raw Revolution Organic Live Food Bars, Spirulina and Cashew, 2.2-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12),Raw Revolution Organic Live Food Bars, Coconut and Chocolate, 2.2-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12),Raw Revolution Organic Live Food Bars, Raspberry and Chocolate, 2.2-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12).3) Greens Plus Organic Food Bars.  This company offer a variety of bars with different ingredients.  Some bars use peanut butter others use cashews.  Some bars use whey protein, others use soy.  So be sure to read the ingredient before you indulge.  This company uses more processed whole food extracts (like the protein powders), but still the company is on the right track.

Good pu'erh tea is fermented then aged for several years and has a very complex flavor, and can command rather high prices. The pu'erh in these bags is obviously not of that caliber. While the brewed tea has a rich, dark color, it lacks the layers of flavors of a good pu'erh tea. The ginger is predomindant, but it's the flavor of dried ginger instead of fresh. The pu'erh flavor notes are limited to a little bit of earthy/woody, and lack the bit of natural sweetness and additional complexity that I've noted in good pu'erh before. Good pu'erh also allows itself to multiple steepings, but this tea lost most of the pu'erh notes and tasted merely of dried ginger when it was steeped a second time.

I opened the box using the perforation so I didn't even realize there was a recipe in the inside flap. A quarter-size sticky keeps the flap attached to the main box, so you don't even have to open it that way unless you want the recipe.Every tea bag has a small indentation, a hint as to where to tear it open. Each bag includes brewing instructions (3 to 5 minutes). But I was disappointed that each tea bag is attached to its string with a small staple. I am sure there are better ways of doing this without the need for staples!Being stingy, I can get two 8oz cups of tea from each tea bag. Obviously the first one is stronger but because this is a strong and dark tea, the second cup still looks dark. I steep the first time for 3 minutes (using a timer). Given its strength, this is good as iced tea as well.The package says that it has higher caffeine but it doesn't provide a number. I usually get a caffeine kick from coffee, but I did not get a kick from this one. Caffeine-wise, it felt like green tea. Some people claim that tea caffeine is slower to enter the bloodstream than coffee caffeine, and tea typically has less caffeine than coffee.

I opened the box using the perforation so I didn't even realize there was a recipe in the inside flap. A quarter-size sticky keeps the flap attached to the main box, so you don't even have to open it that way unless you want the recipe.Every tea bag has a small indentation, a hint as to where to tear it open. Each bag includes brewing instructions (3 to 5 minutes). But I was disappointed that each tea bag is attached to its string with a small staple. I am sure there are better ways of doing this without the need for staples!Being stingy, I can get two 8oz cups of tea from each tea bag. Obviously the first one is stronger but because this is a strong and dark tea, the second cup still looks dark. I steep the first time for 3 minutes (using a timer). Given its strength, this is good as iced tea as well.The package says that it has higher caffeine but it doesn't provide a number. I usually get a caffeine kick from coffee, but I did not get a kick from this one. Caffeine-wise, it felt like green tea. Some people claim that tea caffeine is slower to enter the bloodstream than coffee caffeine, and tea typically has less caffeine than coffee. This certainly explains my reaction to it but caffeine reaction varies, so it's hard to tell how it will affect others. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2036, 2050)",2,0.0,False

Coconut oil, on the other hand, has so many health benefits, it is now classified by many health experts as a ""superfood.""Research has indicated that coconut oil is helpful in treating and preventing Alzheimer's, and it helps prevent epileptic seizures.

It raises the levels of HDL (good) cholesterol and lowers the levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol in the blood.In addition to the fatty acid, lauric acid, that coconut oil naturally contains, during digestion the body creates from coconut oil a monoglyceride called monolaurin. Both of these fatty acids have the ability to kill harmful bacteria, fungi and viruses in the body. This means that if you regularly consume coconut oil, you are less likely to become sick from food-borne illnesses, flu and colds.

Well, Numi decided to, and here is the result.First, I was surprised the Amazon listing didn't show the kosher symbol like most of the other Numi boxes.

Unlike many other organic teas (like Celestial Seasonings), they still individually wrap the tea bags which preserves the flavor and keeps them fresh longer.  The bags are stringless however.I would highly recommend you try a sampler pack before committing to a whole box.  Numi has done an excellent job here, with 2 flavors each of 6 flavors in the sampler pack.  The teas are not just vegetables but include decaffeinated tea as well (two are black, four are green).The black teas are ""beet cabbage"" and ""tomato mint"".

I experimented a bit with it, and found that instead of adding Splenda or Honey, adding Salt greatly brought out the flavor.  In fact, it was a bit like a dilute tomato soup, with a kick from the tea and mint.  Maybe I should add some tea to my tomato soups in the future?The green teas are Carrot Curry, Broccoli Cilantro, Spinach Chive, and Fennel Spice.  Of note is that the Broccoli Cilantro actually contains 90% of your daily requirement of calcium and Fennel Mint contains 50%.  So these teas have benefits if you are trying to increase your calcium intake.  The green teas were all pretty good, with each improving with the addition of a bit of salt.  I know it sounds weird to add salt to tea, but trust me, it brings out the flavor.So why only 4 stars?  I have to be honest - I didn't enjoy any of the teas enough to buy them again.

It's believed to have health benefits. A friend introduced me to this tea at a Chinese herb shop in Thailand. It came in cubes, sort of pressed, and tasted slightly of earth and camphor, which I later found out meant it was particularly good. This tea was not pleasant to drink but if you were feeling ""punk"" with a cold coming on, it would set you up almost immediately. I've run out of it and haven't been back to Asia in a decade. So I was motivated to try Numi's variety of Pu'erh.The Numi Ginger Pu'erh is a lot milder and pleasant to drink; it doesn't have a too-pronounced strong, mushroomy, earthy taste but it is there in the background.  I wish the ginger were stronger--but that is easily fixed.

It's believed to have health benefits. A friend introduced me to this tea at a Chinese herb shop in Thailand. It came in cubes, sort of pressed, and tasted slightly of earth and camphor, which I later found out meant it was particularly good. This tea was not pleasant to drink but if you were feeling ""punk"" with a cold coming on, it would set you up almost immediately. I've run out of it and haven't been back to Asia in a decade. So I was motivated to try Numi's variety of Pu'erh.The Numi Ginger Pu'erh is a lot milder and pleasant to drink; it doesn't have a too-pronounced strong, mushroomy, earthy taste but it is there in the background.  I wish the ginger were stronger--but that is easily fixed.

Overall, this is a slightly better product, with better color and a better taste making the small difference.As with the jalapeno sauce, this product appears to be trying to cover too many bases.  It's ""sauce,"" which means it could go into anything, in cooking or in serving, so it seems to be landing as both a cooking ingredient and as a table condiment.  And it could go on anything from your breakfast eggs to your mac `n cheez for dinner, which makes it a table condiment for breakfast, lunch, dinner, any time.  And its ""bold,"" the American euphemism for something that's not really spicy, is marginally beyond the typical bland and boring that most Americans rely upon.  It's got the tiniest tinge of spice, but isn't powerful in the least; the taste of this product does not qualify as ""bold.""  Now, the taste ofCheez-It Hot & Spicy; they got ""bold"" with that one.The bottle's copy says the same as the jalapeno sauce, that it's perfect with ""tacos, Mexican salads and sandwich wraps.""  In our house it went on pork roast, couscous, green beans, Brussels sprouts, meatloaf, and french fries.  My kids (13 and 15) both liked the sauce and declared it was definitely better than the jalapeno sauce.The basis of this sauce is a mayo/buttermilk dressing-type mixture.  I don't know, but it strikes me that all of the Taco Bell sauces start with the same plain base, and the respective flavors are just dumped in at the factory.  The sauce is not chunky in the slightest, and squeezes right out of the bottle.The pluses in this product are the color and taste.  Where the jalapeno sauce faltered because of an unappetizing color of mayonnaise-off-white with mysterious green flecks, this one's smoky-creamy orange color is far more appealing.  It looks better in the packaging, and it looks much better on the plate and on the food.  The taste also is better. Jalapeno is a very distinctive taste, and those who know it and seek it out want that hard burst of powerful, earthy jalapeno punch, the chipotle taste is one that is more subtle, not nearly as strong, and as such works much better in this sauce.  The taste of this product is slightly smoky, with a good tang--not bold, mind you, and not even close to spicy.The sauce is just a bit too runny, though.  Yeah, it's in a squeeze bottle and it's got to have the right consistency to actually flow out of the packaging, but at the same time, it's a bit too runny when it gets on the plate.  Taco Bell needs to thicken it up just a little bit more to get it to the right consistency.This sauce is not bad; it does not taste bad.  It just doesn't deliver on what I'm looking for when it comes to spicy.  If I were starving on a desert island, I'd slurp this stuff out of the bottle and call it the Food of the Gods.Bottom line: ""Creamy"" this sauce is, but ""bold"" it is not.  Our family knows hot and spicy, and a lame American ""bold"" doesn't cut it for us.  If we want Scoville-graded heat with our food, we'll go for theSriracha,Crystal,Cholula, etc.  If we want creamy, we'll go for the all-American ranch dressing or straight-up mayo, and we'll leave this product on the shelf.

I then made coffee using my Francois et Mimi French Coffee Press [Francois et Mimi Single-Wall Stainless Steel French Coffee Press (34oz)].  I sweetened the coffee using two spoonfuls of the Torani Sugar Free Vanilla Syrup.  It sweetened the coffee without masking its coffee taste.  French Vanilla creamer (Coffee-Mate - Nestle Coffee Non-Dairy Coffee Creamer, 1.5liter French Vanilla) has a tendency to overpower and mask the coffee taste.Next, I made a mocha drink by warming a cup of whole milk on the stovetop and pouring it over two spoonfuls of Caffe D'Vita Sugar Free Hot Cocoa (Caffe D'Vita Sugar Free Hot Cocoa, 10 Ounce Can) and one spoonful of Maxwell House Instant Coffee [Maxwell House Instant, 8-Ounce Jars (Pack of 3)].  Then I added one spoonful of the Torani Sugar Free Vanilla Syrup.  I squirted some Reddi Whip Original Whipped Topping (Reddi Whip Original Whipped Topping, 6.5 Ounce -- 12 per case.) on my drink.  My vanilla mocha tasted wonderful.  It makes a great dessert that will perk you up when you have a lot of work to do before going to bed.  It is especially comforting to drink on a cold, dreary night of which there have been many this bizarre winter.My favorite use of the Torani Sugar Free Vanilla Syrup was when I brewed a packet of Bigelow French Vanilla Tea [Bigelow French Vanilla Tea, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)].  Instead of sweetening it with honey and Stevia (In The Raw Stevia Natural Sweetener -- 100 Packets), I added two spoonfuls of the vanilla syrup.  The French Vanilla Tea tasted heavenly.  In my opinion, tea is healthier than coffee because it contains more antioxidants.  It wakes me up, supports and strengthens my immune system and soothes my allergies, especially when adding honey and lemon.

Kind of thin-tasting. I've had a locally-produced hibiscus tea which has a more assertive flavor (if not the incredible color). I'm going to let this cool down and make some iced tea later and see if that doesn't help this tea out a bit. Another sip. The aroma is heavenly. But the taste is absent.This comes not in a teabag, but a clever little synthetic-material pyramid for some reason. Very novel. Novelty is valuable. Really just the fact that this stuff is so different and comes in a little pyramid tea infuser would make it a nice stocking-stuffer type gift for the tea lover(s) in your life. Or ""teabags"" as a British ex-roommate once described dedicated tea drinkers. Another sip. Still kind of weak-tasting, but I wonder if you couldn't put this stuff in a room humidifier... (don't try this, it's just a thought because this tea smells so great)...The flavor is growing on me, but it's still thin-tasting compared to the incredible aroma...---Unfortunately, this tea wasn't very good as iced tea. Kind of tasted like watered-down fruit punch. ANSWERNOTFOUND",this tea wasn't very good as iced tea,"(1352, 1389)",1,0.7800000000000001,True

Granted, I've not tried other brands, so I've no comparison. I thought each of the flavors was clear and strong--though I steeped mine quite longer than the recommended 10 minutes. At the recommended time, the flavor was just piquing. Letting them go about twice that brought them to a fullness I enjoyed.I take mine with just a pinch of salt, enough to enhance both the savory and sweet notes, and the flavors were delicious.

The flavor is similar to something like Vitamin Water Zero, but slightly less ""diet"" or fake sweetener flavor.  This fruit punch concentrate basically consists of natural flavors, sucralose (splenda) caffeine, and vitamins + taurine.  The flavor is better than I expected.  I will drink this daily, no doubt.Each serving gets you 120% daily vitamin C, and 40% daily of B vitamins.  There is 40mg of caffeine (slightly more than a coca cola, slightly less than a mountain dew, or 1/2 the caffeine in a Red Bull).Likes:- Flavor.  Pretty good for a zero calorie drink.  Sweet but not too fake tasting.- Compact.  Saves fridge space.- Nutrition.  Zero sugar.  Vitamins and a splash of caffeine.Dislikes:- Dosing.  One squeeze is supposed to yield 15ml (1/2 fl oz).  I placed my glass on a kitchen scale and found it takes about a medium-long squeeze to yield 15ml.  A short squeeze is 10 ml.  The longest squeeze was more like 22ml.  I say go by flavor.

Realize that there are solid chunks in the drink (I think it might be the aloe). I like the fact that all the ingredients are recognizable. I think the only thing that might be acting as a preservative is the citric acid.Smell - floral and citrus - smells really good.Feel - the chunks are noticeable in the mouth when drinking. Somewhat difficult to drink as the chunks either get stuck in my teeth and block the flow of tea (not joking) or get stuck on the outside of my mouth. Otherwise refreshing.Taste - The chunks are like little explosions of flavor. I am fairly certain that the chunks are aloe vera. The green tea taste is distinct but not overpowering. The passion fruit flavor gives this a very floral taste. Sweet to the taste. Leaves a lingering bitterness/tartness after drinking. Somewhat unpleasant.Overall impressions:This is a relatively low calorie (80) and somewhat refreshing drink. However, the amount of sugar within (and this is a considerable factor) and the related taste associations keep me from giving this more stars. This drink has 19g of sugar, the equivalent of about 1 1/3 tablespoon. It is the second ingredient listed. Granted, some of the sugars may come from the Aloe Vera (or even perhaps the passion fruit flavor?). But based on the Mayo Clinic's analysis of 2010 Dietary recommendations, by having this one drink you've already had over 1/9 of your daily recommended sugar for men, and over 1/6 for women. This is a little disconcerting, in my opinion. When you look at something (especially like tea, and aloe, and passion fruit) like this drink, you think of things that are generally healthy. There's just so much sugar in this that it becomes difficult for me to give this a more positive review.I think that the only redeeming aspect of this is that the calories are not ALL empty calories (like a soda) as you're assumedly getting antioxidants from the green tea - but why not just drink green tea in that case?
