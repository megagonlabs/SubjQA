It is an easy walk to Fisherman's Wharf, the cable cars, Ghiardelli Chocolate, and even the Alcatraz Tour, though that was a bit further. Parking was $35 per night, but what can you do. The main lobby was very nice, but we got stuck in the building next door, which I believe is where all the riff-raff with AAA discounts are condemned. There is no parking there, except for around 10 spots near the main entrance which were constantly full. So, you have to double park, drop off the luggage, then drive back to the posh hotel to park. Then you repeat the process when you leave. The &quot;annex&quot; is barren, except for the Denny's, which was crowded (not sure why with so much great food around). The rooms were adequate and clean. We only got 3 bath towels for the 4 of us, and it took over an hour on two consecutive nights to get a 4th. Our view was of the tourists in the next wing of the annex. We would stay again only for the location, but try to get a room in the main building. Maybe things are nicer there.

We were given a room on the 21st floor that had a large picture window facing east with nice views of the city and the Bay Bridge beyond. It was fleet week, and they had a large fireworks show over the bay that we could see from our window.As others have said, the rooms are somewhat small (but that is the norm for most hotels in the city) but they are well appointed. The bathroom was adequate but nothing special but there was good pressure and plenty of hot water in the shower.The rooms have plasma tvs and a Sony CD component system. However, there was no high def available and so all you could get from their satellite feed was the standard broadcast &quot;stretched&quot; to fill the Plasma screen. For most this would not be an issue because you don't stay at the Nikko to watch TV but our visit coincided with the Baseball Playoffs and I wanted to catch some of the games. It would have been great to have seen them in high def.Also, the stereo system is very nice but there is just a cheap speaker box above the Sony components which did not sound very good. There should be a speaker system built into the walls or ceiling to get the most out of the music.We didn't use the swimming pool or fitness center because they charged too much. That should be included at the room rates they charge. We also didn't eat in their restaurant but did have room service one night and found the quality and service excellent and not really overpriced at all.As others have commented, it's not necessary to pay extra for the buffet breakfast because there is a Starbucks downstairs and across the street is a fairly decent and reasonable coffee shop that serves breakfast.All in all, we enjoyed our stay at the Nikko. It was convenient to the buses we needed to take out to GG Park and we were also able to spend several hours over at the new mall that has Bloomingdales and Nordstroms. In the basement there is an excellent market that has many hot food offerings that are reasonably priced and looked very good. There are also several inexpesive restaurants to choose from. We ate here one night since I had a cold and had no taste buds so I didn't want to waste my money at the fine restaurants nearby.The Nikko is in a great location right near Union Square and close to the best shopping and also the theater district. The surrounding neighborhood can be a litte seedy if you walk down the wrong streets but overall this area is far improved from what I remember it being in the '70s when I lived in San Francisco. They didn't call it the Tenderloin because there were good steak restaurants nearby. However, from our room, we could look down at Tad's Steak House which, as a starving student in the '60s, was one of the few restaurants I could afford. Next time, we will go check it out.

We are young (41&amp;34) with no kids yet and like to travel well. Galleria Park was chosen after researching the onlines (ExOrbHot.com, etc.) and was booked directly through the property's website. Hope this helps you.As this was our first vacation to SanFran and Napa Valley, we felt best being stationed in the Union Square area. Galleria Park (GP) was chosen because of its boutique style - which is to say that it wasn't &quot;just another chain&quot; hotel but something nice enough and unique to the city we were visiting. We took the BART in from SFO (easy and safe if you don't have more than one bag or so each) and walked to the hotel no problem. GP is in a safe area entirely - that issue should now be completely settled for all of you. Checkin was prompt and efficient. We actually arrived at noon and fully anticipated our room would not be ready yet and intinded to just check our bags till later. It was at this point that a very important factor of a good stay began. The attendant Jacob (?) was most accomodating in every way with an unusual ability to do so without making me feel crowded or rushed or uncomfortable that he's just bucking for a tip. It's a little difficult to explain, but in hindsight I believe it's because their customer service for us kept being incredibly helpful throughout our stay. And that's a thing about GP that needs your consideration.We were informed at noon that our room was not yet ready but that we had been upgraded to a larger room. Why? I don't know, but wonder personally if it is because I kept my reservation during a time when the online's (for a period of about one week) dramatically cut the rates per night by $50-75. We noticed this for other hotels we were considering too. With the jitters in the economy for some, I wonder if the hotels needed to fill up. It didn't seem crowded in SanFran/Napa at all. (March 29-April 4) Our room was very much like the website shows. See my pictures for our room (715). The room is clean and daily maid service did well. The bathroom is small with no counter space at all. The shower pressure was awesome and the temp good. Why don't hotels install fans in the bathrooms? Linen is good. Floors are good. The hotel is old, but it's been redone. It is fine. Our king bed was good, but not great. The pillows were the same. It really was fine, but not exceptional. This is where it differs from Campton Place or The Ritz. It's a hotel room that has been as well done over as could be in an old facility. We don't camp out in the room when we are on vacation, so really, don't you just need a good room in a nice place that is above average? GP is a good choice for that. We did feel comfortable and safe here. The staff does make a difference when you're away from home in unfamiliar territory. Studying and planning make the difference. Chinatown is close, the cable cars are close, cabs are available without much ado, etc., etc. I'll be writing an overall review of our visit in SanFran. I will say that Mr. Toad's tours are THE one you want. They dropped us off right at the GP saving us another ride from the wharf. The bottom line is this: If you can get a good deal, it is a good deal. I would stay here again if I could be sure to get this larger type room. Reading other recent reviews makes me believe that the hotel's smaller rooms would have compromised my impression quite a bit as we have been in such smaller type of rooms at other hotels in the past and they are not good. No, no, no. We require a certain level of luxury when we travel and our room at the GP met that level no problem. ANSWERNOTFOUND",I wonder if the hotels needed to fill up,"(1821, 1861)",2,0.0,False

The lobby of the tower building was very elegant and attractive, while the lobby of the main hotel maintained a nice mix of the historic architecture and modern decor.  We took advantage of the mid-week special dinner menu for St. Francis guests at Michael Mina, which was wonderful, and a fraction of the cost of the more extensive normal menu.

I imagine this is to prevent barking from lonely dogs, and protection against liability. The nature of my visit forced me to ignore their policy, and I slipped the maid a few bucks to smooth things over and arranged times to service the room since they won't enter with a pet present if you are not there.

I had a few friends meet me up there and I was excited to stay at a hotel that I thought would live up to all the standards of a 4-star hotel.Room Quality - horribleWhen we arrived in on our floor, we were disappointed to find the hallways had a musty odor. We figured it was an older property, so we looked the other way until we arrived in our room only to find the same. The room smelled very musty and the carpets looked horrible. Our view of what they call a &quot;courtyard&quot; is a view of the roof with some astroturf looking material. The bathrooms were not the cleanest and very small. And if someone can tell me why they would even leave the 1970's TV in the already small bathroom, is beyond me. The room is very outdated, with what seemed to be Hawaiian headboard, flowery-printed drapery, and asian lamps and pictures on the wall. I've seen nicer rooms at college dorms. The beds were very uncomfortable and it seems that the mattresses were extremely old (perhaps purchased at the same time as the TV in the bathroom!). I shared a bed with my sister and the bed was so saggy that we ended up rolling into the middle of the bed - making for an unpleasant evening with a lovely backache to start off the day. They did have the feather-down comforter and pillow, but that can only do so much.Poor customer service - horribleWhen I arrived at check-in, no one even greeted us to check in. I had to ask the person at the front desk for some assistance. I received a $500 Marriott Travel Card for recognition from my employer. No one on the front desk staff new how to process this card. They then tried to call the number on the back of the card to verify that I really had a $500 balance on the card. There was woman who worked at the front desk who assisted me after the initial person didn't know what to do with the travel card. I can't remember her name but she had big glasses and short spiked grey hair. She seemed impatient not only with me, but with the front desk associate who originally assisted me. I mentioned to them both that I had received and used these travel cards in the past and how they were processed. They continued to tell me that's not what they do, and then told me I would need to surrender the travel card. My two nights stay would not total $500, so I questioned why I would need to give up my card that would still have a balance remaining after my stay. Again, the front desk staff didn't know how to handle this and instead tried to credit my room with $500. After my apparent frustration, they called the manager out and he wasn't quite sure how to handle it, but said if there was a credit balance, he would just credit one of my credit cards or send me a check in the mail. I knew this was probably not supposed to work that way, but had already stood at the front desk for 15 minutes and did not want to debate with them any longer. About 15 minutes after arriving in my room, I received a phone that I needed to come down to the front desk and pick up my travel card. I went back down, picked up my card. The next morning, the message light came on, and it was the front desk telling me they needed to see me because they didn't properly obtain a credit card at check in. This was all extremely frustrating as I tried to handle all of this when I originally checked in. I had 2 guests with me, and I can honestly say that we will never stay at this property and perhaps a Renaissance property again. I also called for a wake up call, and thought I would take advantage of the complimentary hot coffee and hot chocolate service that came with the wake up call. We received the complimentary beverages 30 minutes before the 9 a.m. wake-up call (only because my friend heard them through the paper-thin walls). When the beverages arrived, coffee and tea had been delivered. We had requested hot chocolate, so I called down to the front desk to inquire about this. They said they had me down for tea. I informed them I specifically asked for hot chocolate as I do not drink tea. Their exact words were in a very abrupt and rude voice, &quot;Well it says here you requested tea.&quot; I very politely informed her that I had requested hot chocolate and wanted to see if we could have some sent up. Her response to me was, &quot;You can't have this unless you request it the night before.&quot; I then told her that I had requested this the night before, that is how I received this service in the first place. She then sighed and said she would send some hot chocolate up. The concierge staff was rude and didn't even want to try and help us. I must say however, the driver with their complimentary car service was the only highlight of our stay.I definitely would stay far, far away from this property.

I requested a North facing room because these rooms have heavenly views of the San Francisco Bay, Alcatraz and Coit tower. We had booked three rooms, and no one received a North-facing room. On the second night we all obtained North facing rooms, however these were all on lower levels (i.e. floor 27 and lower). This wasn't a problem for us, as we still had Regency club access and were still high enough to have a lovely view. The rooms were average at best. Nothing that special, except that the beds were fantastic. Small TV in bathroom was a nice perk.REGENCY CLUB: If you have the extra $$$, by all means upgrade to the Regency club. There is breakfast every morning (i.e. croissants, bagels, cereal, TONS of fresh fruit, cheese, ham, juice, coffee etc) and a cocktail hour from 4-7 pm which includes hot appetizers, dips, sodas (wine/spirits $4.00/each).

The restaurant was excellent and the waiter couldn't have been more friendly. The location is also very convenient.Now for the bad. Don't believe what they tell you about the renovations not being disruptive. Half of the hotel is still covered with scaffolding, including the buildings around the pool. If you can get a room away from the construction you will probably have a better opinion than I do about this hotel. The first room we were assigned was on the fourth floor in the &quot;executive&quot; section, which costs slightly more. Don't bother. They were pounding on the outside wall when we arrived and workmen were sitting outside the window with electric saws, etc. This went on for three hours before we requested a different room. Also, the room was in terrible condition. Two lamps didn't work, the wallpaper was peeling and the blinds were water stained. The front desk should be more aware of which rooms are affected by the construction, in my opinion.We tried to call the front desk to request a new room and were on hold for fifteen minutes before finally walking down in person. Once there, they were very accommodating, but we had to downgrade to the second floor. When asked about the premium paid for the 4th floor, he said that it was a wash because the new room had a balcony. Well, it did, but it was level with a roof of air conditioning units and had no furniture on it. That didn't really matter, but we should have received a discount. To be fair, the manager sent up a bottle of chilled champagne to make up for it, which was nice since we hadn't made a scene or anything. The new room was in MUCH better condition and appeared to have been renovated recently.The supposed &quot;executive&quot; room was identical to the standard room, so don't waste your money just to get an ergonomic chair. The regular room had the same desk and internet connection (for $10 a day). The property is old and the bathrooms are microscopic and the amenities provided are the cheapest available, I'm sure.Again, the staff was great. They let us leave our car in the driveway until we checked in so we could move it to the cruise parking garage. They didn't charge us anything, which was nice. The hotel is easy walking distance to the cruise port, which was our ultimate destination.

It couldn't compare with the Westin St. Francis which promises to make your children feel welcome (wecome pkg, etc.). There is not a speck of personal service or attention here. I have always thought of the Westin as a nice hotel and this trip changed my mind. It falls under the Marriott. I will admit that I stayed in a Hampton Inn overnight on a road trip, once, and the room &amp; service was as nice or nicer than this. Our children are the quietest, most well-behaved children (per others) and they said they didn't feel welcome there and actually complained when we pulled into the Westin SF Airport on our last night.

We also had 2 charges that were not ours but they took them off without question and very nicely...they were so obviously not our charges. Room service breakfast was also speedy and friendly. You also have to ask for toiletries. Typically, one would find a shower cap and body soap, but the rooms are only stocked with shampoo and hand soap - nothing more. The recession has hit the hotels! Our room did NOT have the heavenly beds either. They were not great actually; we know heavenly beds, and did have them following our stay when we went to the airport Westin, and the difference is discernable. I can't imagine we just got a bad room.Do not take restaurant recommendations from the concierge; do your own homework! We had a restaurant picked out and the concierge told us she knew of a better one. We should have been clued in when she gave us a post it to give the owner with his name and her full name on it. It wasn't very good and was filled with tourists. Not a single ethnic person in a Chinatown restaurant!?! It was not good and she was obviously getting a kickback from them. (I believe in the form of chinese takeout!) We were unhappy.All in all, if you can get a cheap room and do not want anyone to talk to you from the hotel, stay here.

If you are looking for a convenient location, clean, quiet room for a family -- this was great. We had 2 cable car stops within less than a 5 minute walk. We used them to go to Union Square, Lombard Street, Chinatown and the Cable Car Museum. We could walk to Ghiradelli Square, the Cannery, the Wharf, and Pier 39. We also could walk to our rental car pickup (Enterprise) and the F line (street car) easily. We used the F to get to the pier for the Alcatraz cruise and to go to the Ferry Building/Farmer's Market . We were able to take a city bus to the Marina easily. We also used the bus to go to Golden Gate Park (although it was a bit of a haul). We were only a block away from the firetruck tour -- which by the way, was the absolute best part of the trip!! I can't recommend it enough! My main point is that the Hyatt at the Wharf's location is great for families who are heading to San Francisco to sightsee. We debated as to whether we should stay in the Union Square or the Wharf area. The Wharf is definitely the way to go for sightseeing families with kids. The rooms were clean and the hotel was quiet. We did use the pool twice, but briefly -- it was chilly. The pool really shouldn't be a factor when choosing a hotel in San Francisco. There is so much to see and do. We got the Rise and Shine rate which included a full breakfast buffet (very nice) voucher for 2 people each morning. We actually used 4 of the vouchers for 2 of the mornings and paid the extra $9 for one child. That way we didn't feel obligated for all of us to eat there every morning. While the breakfast buffet was great, the dinner at the hotel restaurant was not the best -- and they charged for refills of the kids' lemonades. We had friends stay at the Argonaut at the same time. They said it was nice and it was only a block or two from us, so they had the same convenient location. I would probably try the Argonaut if I went again. Not because there was anything bad about the Hyatt -- we had no problems whatsoever. I just think the Argonaut looked a little bit nicer from the outside.

This is apparently a challenge in this city but eventually we found what looked like a great location and a good hotel. Many of the hotels that we had looked at had poor reviews and the Nikko had a fairly high score. If you are looking for a clean hotel with a strong minimalist theme then the Nikko may be for you but we would caution that minimalist appears to have been taken to an extreme. Minimalist should not mean soulless. The lobby is dead, bland and empty. The hotel bar closed. The staff professional yet not very friendly. When we have stayed in other hotels, such as the Hyatt or Hilton the staff eventually recognise you if you are staying over a few days. That may not appeal to some but it adds a human touch, the Nikko staff were almost robotical. In the Nikko by day 7 of attending breakfast they almost recognised us. Hard to notice a family of four! Whilst it may be hard to fault the Nikko's rooms which are comfortable I guess the best way to describe our experience is an ok hotel, in a great location with no soul. A true test is always to ask would you go back and in our case the clear answer would be no. There must be better hotels that offer a good room but with a touch of life and a staff that occasionally show a human touch. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1422, 1436)",1,0.0,False

It wouldn't have been my first choice. I normally stay at a four or five star hotel. Also, this was quite a commute to Moscone.Based on other reviews, I called to request a room in the main building. On arrival, I was given a room on the business executive floor (5th). There were 3 computers available for guests on the floor. My room had free wireless internet, a small refrigerator and microwave. The room had been renovated fairly recently and was in nice shape. The bed was comfortable and with the choices from the pillow menu, I slept surprisingly well.The only downside to the stay was the small in-room safe. I had called in advance to make sure there was a safe in the room that would hold my laptop. I was put on hold for about 5 minutes while they checked. On arrival, I found that the safe was too small to hold my purse, much less my laptop. For the price paid, this was a nice hotel. It is very convenient to the touristy wharf area.

After I broke my leg, they moved me to a handicapped room and then when someone was able to join me to help take care of me they moved me to a handicapped junior suite. These rooms are a bit bigger but they faced Geary Street which can be a bit noisy with ambulances and firetrucks at night. Don't let this put you off, any hotel in downtown SF will have the same issue, I put in ear plugs and had no more problems, or you can just ask for a quiet room not on Geary street. My first room was in the back and for my first four nights there was no noise at all. If you are in a wheelchair, make sure to specify you want a roll in shower as one of the handicapped rooms had it but the junior handicapped suite did not. The bathrooms are goregous. Such a well-run hotel. Oh, the first day I checked in, I asked for a goldfish. They sent one up in a fishbowl and that little guy turned out to be my companion for the next 4 weeks. It's a great touch from a hotel full of great touches. My friends have asked me when I come back to San Francisco if I'd stay there again considering all of the pain and trauma I went through.

A very pleasant check-in with Natty the friendly Receptionist resulted in her offering us a &quot;special room&quot; and the option of declining the room if it did not meet our expectation.Up to the 27th floor of the new tower to a corner suite. Were we heck going to forfeit this for a standard room!! The lobby area of the suite was larger than the bedroom we had come from Yountville and I felt like a superstar!

The starbucks coffee maker was a bonus, plasma TV, safe, etc all standard these days.After a long tiresome day we decided to eat in the Oak Room - and too were not disappointed. Could imagine in bygone days that this was the place for the aristrocracy and 'incrowd' of San Francisco to be seen. Quite formal and sedate, but the service and the food were excellent. There appeared to be a mature 'celebrity' dining whilst we were there and caused a bit of a cawfuffle amongst the more mature diners in the restaurant. Any interactions we had with staff were delightful. Our housekeeping service failed to supply towels one of the days, but a quick call resulted in an ample supply being delivered. My only negativities towards the Westin St Francis is the charge for the use of the business centre. I had reason to check my emails and print 2 pages which resulted in a charge of $12. A bit extreme for a couple of minutes use. However I have seen it mentioned on other threads and now appears to be standard. The other was the lack of soundproofing (which always amuses me when others mention it in city hotel reviews!).

They are so small, you can't even do a 360 in them without giving yourself a concussion. This may be fine for little people but it's simply very uncomfortable for anyone over 5ft tall. The clothing hooks in the bathrooms are also so small that you cannot hang anything without it falling off instantly. This may seem very petty, but believe me, is VERY annoying.Another point worth a mention is the Air Con...it's the size of a range cooker, and earth shatteringly loud.Also, the hotel layout is like a maze, and finding your way to your room from the elevator can be an expedition.Still, if your young, healthy and consider yourself vertically challenged, this may well be the perfect place for you!

We opted to stay at the Castle Inn after reading numerous reviews and checking out prices. All I can say is that our visit lived up to our expectations. The Castle Inn was clean and centrally located to many of the attractions we were interested in visiting. While researching places to stay, I was impressed with the prior reviews of this location as well as the fact that the GM personally responded to one of the only negative reviews posted. When we checked in, I was pleased with the exceptional 'customer service' we received. Without inquiry, we were provided with everything we could possibly need to navigate the city. We received a map of the city, local bus and trolley routes as well as first hand advice on which roads to take and places of interest. This type of service was routine during our visit. Interestingly enough, on one of the days we were visiting, the hotel management was replacing the room furniture. Let me tell you, it was a recipe for disaster when you consider that a large moving truck had to be parked in front of the hotel and the movers needed to complete this task in a three level hotel without disturbing guests. Personally, I was pleased with how the process went. The night before the move, the GM called us to advise what was going to happen and what we should expect. Although the movers were later than expected, I was completely satisfied with the manner in which our furniture swap was handled. The pictures currently available on this site appear to have the older furniture. The new furniture is much lighter in color.A few other notable benefits of this location include free parking (which is very impressive when you look at other hotels), an abundance of restaurants nearby and the ability to walk to locations such as the Fisherman's Wharf, Chinatown, Coit Tower, Lombard St, and Union Square. Please note that I indicated the ability to walk to these locations. A few are a good 2 mile + walk so please take that into consideration. If you are thinking about staying at the Castle Inn, please be aware this isn't similar to a Marriott or a Sheraton. It isn't nearly as plush. If you are the type of traveler that is looking for a reasonable place to stay where you can ask the hotel staff for advice or suggestions, then the Castle Inn is likely for you.

Since I used to live in SF and travel their quite frequently for work, I am quite familiar with the city and knew we would want to stay in union square (as my boyfriend has never been there and this is the best &quot;touristy&quot; spot). I usually prefer to stay at the Sir Francis Drake or the Westin St. Francis but both were overbooked. I was left with the Clift and Hotel Nikko. I definiately made the wrong choice even though I had heard good things about the lounge and restaurant. Since I have stayed at the Morgan (NYC) several times I assumed we would have a pleasant experience and I LOVE Asia de Cuba in NYC. I was wrong!  When we arrived at the Clift, the doorman did not even open the door or even aknowledge our pressence. Check-in was smooth but the girl was certainly rushing us and annoyed with any questions. Our original plan was to spend our first night with dinner at Asia De Cuba and start off with some early evening cocktails at the Redwood Room. BIG MISTAKE. Upon check-in we asked if we needed reservations for the Redwood Room. The girl gave us some &quot;preferred customer&quot; cards of some sort which she explained would get us right in with no problem. We approached the hostess at about 730 pm. There were a couple of guys in front of us whom the hostess was assisting. As we patiently waited, a large group came up behind us. The matron of the group approached the hostess - cutting in front of everyone else AND interrupting the conversation between the hostess and the 2 guys. Rather than telling this RUDE woman to go stand in line actually assisted her! The guys in front of us looked apalled and we were infuriated. Once it was finally our turn (like that mattered to the hostess) she very rudely told us we couldnt come in without a reservation. She said she had people arriving at 9 pm. We explained we just wanted ONE pre-dinner cocktail. At this point she got even more rude. At this point we decided this was NOT a place we wanted to spend out money anyways. They obviously dont care about their actual guests! The scene was horrible anyways. I dont think there was a patron under the age of 65 in the entire bar.... so much for a &quot;hip&quot; bar scene. We tried to complain to a manager but he was too busy having a personal conversation with one of the doormen. We decided our money is better spent elsewhere and opted against dinner in the hotel. We had a lovely meal in the Marina district then went on to drinks at Matrix where our patronage was appreciated and our drinks were not accompanied with a side of rudeness. I might also point out the martinis are $8 at Matrix as opposed to the overpriced drinks Redwood Room with serve you along with their snooty attitude. We are from LA so we are no strangers to attitude but this was just plain RUDE.  Aside from the horrible experience our first night, the hotel lobby is quite nice. The rooms are VERY small and somewhat dirty. The bathroom is appalling - dirty towels, the fan doesnt work, no standing room. On our final day, the anger from night one had worn off slightly (probably because we spent as little time in the hotel as possible). We were packing our stuff and relaxing from a morning of shopping. The day before, housekeeping entered our room even though we had the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign on the door. Since nothing was taken we ignored it. Now here we are, a mere hour from escaping the Clift, when there is a knock at the door...housekeeping. I explain we are leaving at 1 (check out time) and to please respect the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign. 15 minutes later, another knock at the door. It is the housekeeper AGAIN. I tell her &quot;we are still here&quot; and remind her of our departure time. Sure enough, another knock at the door and who could it be? The SAME housekeeper. At this point we are so frustrated my boyfriend tells her to wait outside and we gather all our stuff (half packed and all). They clearly wanted us gone so we sprinted to the elevator checked out and left the Clift behind.  Trust me, the Clift offers NOTHING to validate such horrible attitudes and behavior. I had high hopes for this place and if they had impressed me, I would have considered staying there on my monthly business trips up to SF. Forget it. I will definately tell everyone I know NOT to stay here and I will probably never stay at the Morgan again either just because of the Clift affiliation. Trust me, you are better off at the Sir Francis Drake or the Westin. At least they know you exist there and are gracious for your patronage.

We reserved a &quot;deluxe king corner guest room&quot;, which was on the 7th floor. Compared to the last SF hotel I stayed at (Hotel Triton), the room was *huge*. The Joie De Vivre/Hotel Adagio website gave a pretty accurate preview and 360 degree virtual tours of what we could expect with respect to our room, the lobby, etc. Our bathroom was oddly shaped, but was also ginormous compared to what you might expect from an older property. (We theorized our room--which was not a suite--was actually two tiny rooms remodeled into a larger one. Again, this isn't a complaint.) If you're an Aveda user, you'll like the complementary shampoo and soap. ;-) The lobby was very chic and modern, spacious, really quiet, and the staff was friendly enough. PROS*The hotel is super-convenient to Union Square, the fancy new Westfield SF Ctr. with a brand new Bloomingdale's, ritzy food court, and the world famous Nordstrom with the curving escalator. Macy's, Saks Fifth Ave., and Neiman Marcus are only a few blocks away as well.*The Powell St. BART/MUNI station is probably a 7-minute walk to/from the Adagio. This was key for us because we could board the cable cars at Powell St., or take public transportation to the Castro or the Mission District (via BART) or the new DeYoung Museum in Golden Gate Park (via MUNI).*There's FREE WI-FI in the lobby, and FREE internet in the hotel rooms. (They'll even lend you an ethernet cable if you don't have one!) Since paying for internet connectivity at the other chain 4-star hotels annoys me to no end, I am so appreciative of the Adagio's free internet. Additionally, if you didn't bring a laptop, there are 3-4 computer terminals in the &quot;business center&quot; (really a quiet hallway behind the lobby) which are free for guests to use.*My boyfriend and I didn't take advantage of them, but the Adagio offers several complementary walking tours of SF with fun themes like &quot;hidden local cafes and breakfast spots,&quot; &quot;gay SF&quot;, a &quot;foodie tour,&quot; etc.*The entire property is non-smoking. Hooray. CONS*Not really a criticism of the hotel, but SF's homeless problem is well-documented. The Adagio is in the &quot;Theater District&quot; (is this a bona fide SF neighborhood, or the tourism board's spin?), which is only a couple blocks from Union Square--but also only a couple blocks from the Tenderloin. We never felt uncomfortable (we're from Seattle, and there's a noticeable homeless presence there too), but really--if you're staying in the city's most popular tourist destination, you should expect that panhandlers will naturally congregate in that area as well. MY TIPS*If you're a light packer, you can take Air BART/BART from Oakland to the Powell St. BART/MUNI station for less than $10 one way. Just be prepared to walk a few generous blocks to/from the hotel. (Believe me, it's an invigorating walk, not the Bataan Death March. Really.)*The Adagio offers free internet connectivity, both wired and wireless. We like free.*There's complementary tea and coffee in the lobby, or you can go a block and a half east to the Starbucks located directly next to the Hotel Diva. There's a Walgreen's less than a block from the hotel.*In the aformentioned Westfield SF Ctr., there's the *world's ritziest food court*, with a reasonably priced food (for SF) and a Beard Papa's (a Japanese chain selling yummy creme puffs), as well as a fancy-schmancy Bristol Farms supermarket.*We bought a 3-day MUNI &quot;passport&quot;, which costs $18 and gives unlimited MUNI transport. If you factor that round-trip fare on the cable cars = $10, you're already ahead.

The location is great for those planning on visiting the Union Square area, shopping on Market Street, and reaching Fisherman's Wharf within a ten-fifteen minute cab ride.

The bathroom was adequate but nothing special but there was good pressure and plenty of hot water in the shower.The rooms have plasma tvs and a Sony CD component system. However, there was no high def available and so all you could get from their satellite feed was the standard broadcast &quot;stretched&quot; to fill the Plasma screen.

That should be included at the room rates they charge.

A very pleasant check-in with Natty the friendly Receptionist resulted in her offering us a &quot;special room&quot; and the option of declining the room if it did not meet our expectation.Up to the 27th floor of the new tower to a corner suite. Were we heck going to forfeit this for a standard room!! The lobby area of the suite was larger than the bedroom we had come from Yountville and I felt like a superstar! The main area was overwhelming with stunning views of the city scape, bay and Coit Tower. Those heavenly beds are so conducive to a good night's sleepBathroom was spacious with the standard shower over bath, good towels and adequately stocked. The starbucks coffee maker was a bonus, plasma TV, safe, etc all standard these days.After a long tiresome day we decided to eat in the Oak Room - and too were not disappointed. Could imagine in bygone days that this was the place for the aristrocracy and 'incrowd' of San Francisco to be seen. Quite formal and sedate, but the service and the food were excellent. There appeared to be a mature 'celebrity' dining whilst we were there and caused a bit of a cawfuffle amongst the more mature diners in the restaurant. Any interactions we had with staff were delightful. Our housekeeping service failed to supply towels one of the days, but a quick call resulted in an ample supply being delivered. My only negativities towards the Westin St Francis is the charge for the use of the business centre. I had reason to check my emails and print 2 pages which resulted in a charge of $12. A bit extreme for a couple of minutes use. However I have seen it mentioned on other threads and now appears to be standard. The other was the lack of soundproofing (which always amuses me when others mention it in city hotel reviews!). Although we were on the 27th floor, the city noise was evident - but hay ho we were in a vibrant, buzzing city and got over it. If I wanted peace and quiet we would have booked an out of town, country retreat! I had little to grumble about!Hotel was busy with a number of conventions each day of our visit, however elevators were prompt and there was no delay getting to floors.

Even with the earplugs in place that were so thoughfully provided, we could hear street noise. Fire trucks, police cars, motorbikes, and yelling reached our rooms. Then, at 2:15 a.m. on Saturday, we were awakened by a group of drunken guests making their way back to their rooms. Nice! No fault of the hotel, of course, but just added to our annoyance. On Saturday evening, we were entertained into the wee hours by a prom that was taking place in the 4th flloor ballroom. Nice of the hotel to advise us that such an event was taking place. My husband had to call the front desk and ask when the thumping rap noise might cease. I would have gladly paid more for a higher floor had I been advised of the noise issues and the party.

But the rooms are definitely hit or miss and it is quite random whether you will get a nice accommodation. On the plus side, the hotel is conveniently located downtown in the financial district. A bit far from the convention center or tourist destinations but great if you are in town for work. The staff is generally professional and helpful.The lobby is a bit small and it can be difficult to get past all the doormen to get to the desk. Mind you, they are friendly and willing to help, but often there are 3 standing right in front of the doors, sometimes one is on the staircase leading into the hotel, so it feels like you are sneaking past the Secret Service every time you enter the hotel. At some hotels the doormen quickly open the door and get out of your way but here they are usually in conversation and don't notice you until you are already past.Speaking of small, the rooms are on the small side as well, which is not too uncommon for an older property. Don't waste your time on a &quot;premium&quot; room as the extra square footage is mostly in a long hallway that isn't useable. On paper these rooms are larger but they end up feeling the same size.Premium rooms also have two televisions but unfortunately the Omni is one of those hotels that has upgraded to 'high-def&quot; TVs but not high-def programming. Everything on screen is stretched wide to fill the wider screen, which ends up making everything all distorted - all the actors look squat and fat. Some hotels allow you to set the TV back to the regular aspect ratio to fix this, but not the Omni. I guess they don't want the black bars on the sides of the screens. But the result is that they can claim to have high-quality TVs while the picture quality is actually worse than your average Holiday Inn.Premium rooms offer &quot;a courtyard view&quot;. Be aware that this means you will probably get some light through the window but the actual &quot;view will be of a wall, or large machinery. Definitely nothing you would take a picture of if you aren't an HVAC engineer.If they are busy don't gamble on a smoking room unless you really don't mind the smell. The Omni gets a lot of heavy smokers so those rooms truly reek.The hotel restaurant is okay, basic big-city hotel food (at very high prices) but nothing to get excited about.All in all, if you can book during a slow period when you can easily change rooms to find one more to your liking then the Omni is an acceptable downtown hotel.

Actually, most of the clientele tends to be younger and somewhat hip. I think the hotel is trying to go for that anyway, so that's good (I'm a twenty-something myself).I walked into the room, and was disappointed (at first). It was a glorified dorm room. Very small, and you walk RIGHT into it. The bathroom is small, and the sink is outside in the room. On the plus side, I got used to these things rather quickly, and it wasn't a huge deal. One thing to note though: if you leave the door open after taking a shower, the steam will drift into your room, as there is no fan in there (something to keep in mind as you use the bathroom other times).The king size bed is very, very comfy. I've been to the Hard Rock Chicago which sports a king size pillowtop with down bedding and pillows, and Diva definitely took the take.Wireless Internet was wonderful, and seemed to be rather fast most of the time. It's unsecure, just something to keep in mind. SF seems to have free Wi-Fi almost everywhere, though.During my stay, I asked the main clerk working the desk to recommend a good lounge for me. I took his advice, and it turned out pretty well. He also seemed to have a good feel for the area too (doubled as a concierge, I suppose).Check-out was smooth as well, and I was billed correctly.

They did move us the next day but with no compensation - I could say that was a minor problem but it was a really unpleasant experience. What it did give me however was a perspective on two totally different rooms. Both rooms were TINY, I'm talking cruise ship tiny. And I can tolerate that, especially for that price in a major city, but my wife was displeased. Just be aware. Secondly, the bathrooms, while clean, are very small and have no counter space, just a small glass shelf that holds very little. Our second bathroom was much bigger than the first but the shelf space was the same. On that order, and much more unpleasantly, the water temperature in both showers was wildly uneven.

Worked out great, and the hotel staff helped us keep on our budget without our feeling cheap!We parked our car at a garage just 3 blocks down from the hotel, so we were able to save a bit by not using the valet parking of the hotel. It saved us about $12 each day, which adds up!The people working at the Orchard were extremely helpful and friendly. The doormen were exceptionally nice and willing to help in whatever way they could. The front desk staff was great, too. We tried to tip the maids and doormen for their services and they seemed very appreciative, not like they just expected it. The king sized bed we had was SOOOOOOO comfortable. The comforter on top and the 100% Egyptian cotton sheets were wonderful after a long day of walking around S.F. We also enjoyed watching movies using the free DVDs from the front desk and the DVD player in the room.The Azur brand lotion, body wash, shampoo and conditioner made us feel pampered and smelled so good. We requested that the maid leave some extra and left her a tip, and we were delighted to have a few extra! The large bathroom allowed us to spread out and added to the luxurious atmosphere.The location is excellent. Close to China town, a cable car line, Union Square, etc. The Golden Gate bridge is a short drive away, too.One caution: My knees had serious problems with the incredibly steep streets, even with excellent walking shoes. Take the public transportation whenever possible, and save your legs for seeing the sights! The only downside was our view. We requested a high floor, which they granted. But our &quot;view&quot; was of the top of another building, and other buildings beyond. The location was quiet, however.We loved the Orchard Hotel and appreciated everything that the staff did to make our stay wonderful! Thanks!

The price was good, the location was absolutely perfect (one block from Union Sq. and the Powell St. Cable Car route), and the room and bathroom were very clean. The bed was even nicer than your average cheap hotel. And the staff were friendly. However everything else was awful.First of all, they put is in a miserably smelly smoking room when we asked for non-smoking. They couldn't move us after we complained because it was the last room in the hotel. Well, if they held the room for our reservation, why didn't they hold the right one? They did move us the next day but with no compensation - I could say that was a minor problem but it was a really unpleasant experience. What it did give me however was a perspective on two totally different rooms. Both rooms were TINY, I'm talking cruise ship tiny. And I can tolerate that, especially for that price in a major city, but my wife was displeased. Just be aware. Secondly, the bathrooms, while clean, are very small and have no counter space, just a small glass shelf that holds very little. Our second bathroom was much bigger than the first but the shelf space was the same. On that order, and much more unpleasantly, the water temperature in both showers was wildly uneven. It went from freezing to boiling and back again, and it made taking showers take twice as long because you had to hide in a corner waiting for the temperature to regulate. Again, it *sounds* minor but was a huge problem after 4 nights.But even if I gave all that a pass, the single worst thing about this hotel, why I gave it two stars, and why I won't recommend it to anybody, is that the doors, floors, ceilings, and walls are thinner than balsa wood. You can hear everything once you try to go to bed. TV across the hall? Check. Couple next door having a romantic evening? Check. Screaming baby one floor above you? Check. Cable Car bells 9 floors down and 1 block away? Check. It was horrible. The building has no A/C so you can't blast the fan to drown out the noise, it's just you and all the other visitors who tried to save a buck at the cheapo King George. I normally never complain much, I can't think of the last time I submitted a negative review about something, but this was something I had to share. Buyer beware!

I figured even if I could not be assured of the exact location I desired, I would be able to count on a decent room. Basically this is what I got. The room itself was fine, if a bit dark (we were on the 8th floor). This is a very large hotel (39 floors) with a lobby that never sleeps in an area that seems pretty busy all the time as well. Location: If you go south on Market, more to the heart of the financial district, things are nice, the sidewalks clean, and even a few trees planted here and there. If you go north on Market, the streets gets dirtier, and the stores seedier. Sixth street, which is two blocks up, is particularly &quot;unscenic.&quot; Fourth St., where the hotel is located, appears to be the cutoff point for the neighborhood. Also, if the main entrance was on Market, rather than Fourth, it would be a big improvement. The main entrance is recessed, which is prob. appreciated when it rains, but looks dark and grungy, and the sidewalk on Fourth is narrow, which makes it crowded with all the tourists streaming in and out. Interiors: The interiors are fine, generally speaking, but one morning I walked to the elevator to find a pile of Cheetos on the floor, some of which had been ground into the carpeting. It was still there 2-3 hours later. Same thing with gum wrappers. This type of thing skeeves me out. The lobby is glitzy. There is a waterfall somewhere (used to mitigate lobby noise) and things like chandeliers and marble. However, all this being said, the basics were fine, and I could stand the shortcomings given that we had gotten a decent discount through Priceline. Still, I could not help but think everyone else passing through the lobby had gotten the same deal.In sum,the pros: *two blocks from the BART station*decent rooms with comfortable beds and nice bathrooms*friendly, professional front desk staffthe cons: *dark, recessed entrance in slightly borderline area (in my opinion)*hallways outside rooms could be cleaner (saw ground Cheetos and bits of toilet paper on the carpeting)*a bit of nickel and diming (Internet and parking--parking is $49/day) but I suppose this is to be expected at a hotel that caters to business travelers who are getting reimbursed by their companies anyway ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2293, 2307)",5,0.0,False

We booked it based on TripAdvisor reviews. I'm very glad I found this hotel here because the only way to book is directly through the hotel (no Orbitz, hotels.com, etc). The hotel is very easy to get to and is in a great neighborhood. I was a little worried that there might not be much around the hotel since it's not near Union Square or Fisherman's Wharf, but there's actually quite a few little shops and at least 30 restaurants within a 2 block radius of the hotel. The first night we were there, we walked to the bay - it was a quick 1/4-1/2 mile walk - which was a great way to look at all the million-dollar houses in the area (what beautiful architecture!) It's an upscale neighborhood and I always felt safe outside.There are several bus stops within 2-3 blocks. We used the bus system the entire time we were there - it's definitely the easiest way to get around. We did get a rental car, but only used it to get to/from the airport and for a trip to Muir Woods one day. The hotel does have free parking.Our room was cleaned very well every day. We didn't have any interaction with hotel staff other than check-in and check-out. I recommend bringing a key chain because all they give you is a loose key.We did not have any problem with noise, however my husband often falls asleep with the TV on, so the two of us are probably just used to some noise. Our room was on the first floor facing Steiner street (I've attached a photo taken from our window, facing the corner of Steiner and Lombard).Things that didn't add or take away from our stay, but I would recommend to the hotel management:- The pictures on the website seriously need to be updated. The ugly wallpaper in those pictures is no longer in the rooms. Our room was much more pleasant looking in person than in the website pictures.- It would've been nice to have a comfy chair or small couch in the corner of our room. The bay window is lovely, but there's just this big empty space next to it. Our room had a single king bed, so the double bed rooms probably fill this space better.- I wouldn't book my stay on the website because it does not have a secure server (http vs. https).- When I went to check out at 5:30am, no one was at the front desk. After a few minutes, I thought I heard someone rustling in back, so I called out &quot;Hello??&quot; That did the trick. :o) I think if employees are going to hang out in back during slow times, a bell on the door or on the desk would be an easy solution.We ate at many of the restaurants close to our hotel and enjoyed them all:- Country Sky Chinese (across Steiner street) - We loved this place! Our food was fantastic and the staff was incredibly sweet.- Barney's Gourmet Hamburgers (next door on Steiner) - Food was good, but the wait was long (and the restaurant wasn't full). I'd still recommend this place - it seems as though the entire town is short on wait staff, and everyone works very hard.- Izzy's Steak and Chops (across Steiner street) - This was a treat. I had Swordfish and just loved it, my husband had lamb and said it was good, but not the best he'd had. This was the most expensive place we visited.- Mel's Diner (across Lombard street) - This is a 50's style, jukebox diner. Food was good, milkshakes were great. We enjoyed our meal, but it didn't really make me think of &quot;San Francisco&quot;.- Squat and Gobble (on Chestnut, about a 2 block walk from the hotel) - We had lunch here and it was fantastic. Lots of salads and crepes.- Korean BBQ (I can't remember the actual name of the restaurant, but it's right next to the hotel on Steiner street) - We got take-out one night and ate it in our hotel room. My husband really enjoyed this, but it was the first time either of us had eaten Korean food, so I can't tell you how authentic it was.

To cut a long story short, it took the hotel 48 hours to get it fixed. I was offered no real apology and had to ask to use another room to get a shower. Apparently, they were all booked up to move me on a permanent basis. Unbelieveable! Would I stay here again?

I would have given a five star (excellent) rating had it not been our room location, immediately off the elevators and on the Montgomery side. Guest noise from the elevators, a quite vocal and inebriated local shouting at the top of his lungs from midnight until 1am on the the Montgomery side and early morning (9am) vacuuming right outside our door (despite a privacy please sign), left us with a less than rest-filled evening. But, the location of this hotel (on the California trolley line), a short walk from the F line for quick access to the Wharf or, if you are inclined as were we, a longer scenic walk to the Wharf and onto Ghiradelli's, plus the hotel's catering staff and beautiful ambiance would lead me to it's doors yet again when I am in the San Francisco area. Also just a block away is a Walgreen's and, our favorite, Jamba Juice! A $50 per night parking fee (for your car) seems high but is likely the going rate.

What we liked best was having the stocked fridge of free soft drinks and water everyday. It was great to be able take a couple of waters with us for the days adventures. The breakfast was super, it was neat to see the staff come up with a new dish everyday. What I thought was cool was that the dish was homemade and not just fom the freezer. On Cinco de Mayo we had a mexican style quiche. In the lobby they had a different cookie everyday in the cookie jar, and those could have easily just been frozen chocolate chop cookies. But each day we had a different kind of cookie (Russian tea balls, Lemon poppyseed, a shortbread of sorts, and a oatmeal chip). The location was great, except for the one hill on Powell street we had to walk up to reach the hotel from the BART.

Nice view of the city. We had driven up from San Diego so we had our car but when my husband saw the in-hotel parking garage charged $27 a day he opted to park on the street for part of our stay and at the $9 per day lot across the street for one stretch of time... That worked out fine for us. (Also, if you have a handicapped sticker on your car, you don't have to feed the meter during the week or so we were told.)I especially liked the Gym on the fourth floor, which had treadmills, stair steppers, recumbant and upright bikes, variety of weight machines and a TV, plus towels and water supplied. It was never crowded when I was there. I also enjoyed the heated pool (also on the fourth floor) which at mid day is in full sunlight so even though it was a bit chilly that day it was warm in the pool and lots of chaise lounges around and tables and chairs. I also liked the breakfast buffet. Mine was free because I am a Priority Club member.There are two floors, 12 and 13 which the elevator will not stop at unless you have a keycard for that floor. So I guess if you are extremely security conscious you could ask for a room on one of those floors. My brother and his wife were on 12 but they did not ask for any special room, they were actually kind of annoyed that they had to insert the key to get up to their floor. The front desk neglected to tell them. But there is a sign in the elevator to that effect.Nice bathroom, hair dryer, ironing board and iron in the closet. Enough hangers. A little low on surface/drawer space (three drawers in TV armoire and that was all). Lighting for applying makeup not very good, but they did have--in addition to the bathroom mirror--a pull out round mirror with a magnifying side that you could position different ways, plus the closet doors were floor to ceiling mirrors. (Well I was there for a wedding so these things were important to me!) Shower head had massage options.The staff was very friendly, all of them. There were several tour groups staying there, and lots of international guests. I heard German, Italian, Japanese and Scandinavian (not sure which) spoken around me).

The all-day tea &amp; coffee (good tea and coffee, by the way) was appreciated, and the fresh-baked cookies were a treat. I spent some early evenings in the library, reading and sipping wine -- very nice!! The diner next door is convenient. The location of the hotel is central to everything. Yes, the rooms are small. I actually had one of the smallest rooms, but it was cozy, clean, comfortable and had a big closet. This is NOT a Hilton, Marriott or any other big chain hotel -- Thank Goodness! This hotel has lots of character; the furnishings are antiquey; and the whole thing has quiet elegance. I was on the fifth floor &amp; could hear the cable car go by (I like to keep the window open). It didn't bother me, but I suppose you could ask for a quieter room in the back if you are particularly sensitive to street noise.

Check in was very quick and the bellboy who took our bags up was extremely informative and friendly. He turned the thermostat down for us, showed us how to use the menu guide on the tv, explained where everything in the hotel was and the how to get to the cable cars, etc. Concierge very knowledgeable. We passed by a wine bar a few blocks from the square on our first night, and when I couldn't remember where it was (or its name) the next day, he knew exactly where it was and whipped out a map with a marked route to get us there. The hotel staff in general are very helpful and polite. We were lucky in that we were given what I guess is a larger room with king bed. Room was probably 20X12. The room was painted in soothing shades of creams/tans with white woodwork, coved ceiling and lots of crown moulding, a crystal chandelier, and large flat screen tv. Bathroom was small, but in great condition and well appointed. My husband's a triathlete, so we visit the gym in every hotel we stay in. He was very impressed with the gym at the Westin. Overall, I would recommend this hotel for location and historical charm. It seems other reviews complain about things like room size, small bathrooms, outdated decor, etc. This hotel is for those that enjoy the charm of historical buildings. If you're looking for a huge master suite type bathroom and olympic sized pool, go somewhere else. Only downside was paying $14 a day for internet and $16 a day for the gym.

We booked a room here based on reviews we read on TripAdvisor. Coming from a small city to a large area like San Francisco, we were stepping outside our comfort zone so one of our main concerns was finding a safe place to stay in a safe neighborhood. A second concern was finding a reasonably priced hotel which would allow us to spend our extra cash on tours, attractions, restaurants - in short, on experiencing the city. The Castle Inn exceeded our expectations in both areas. We felt safe, and we were able to stay four days in a clean, comfortable, reasonably priced hotel. We walked EVERYWHERE from this hotel - Fisherman's Wharf, Chinatown, the Trans America Building, Coit Tower, Lombard Street, the Palace of Fine Arts, Fort Point, and the Golden Gate. Granted, some of these were rather long hikes, but we were still so pleased not to have to worry about transportation and really experience the city on foot.We enjoyed meeting and talking to Arlene, Marshall, and Varsa. In particular, we appreciate the extra work that Varsa went to in booking us a deluxe city tour with Alcatraz, and in booking us a shuttle back to the airport at the conclusion of our stay.We absolutely intend to visit San Francisco again, and we'll be booking at the Castle Inn for sure.

As she interned in San Francisco during college, we decided to head out there for some R&amp;R.

We got in around noon, and were easily checked in to our room. Each time we dealt with the front desk, they went above and beyond professional customer service to take care of us. *Room-The room more than suited our needs. Granted, we did not have the best view (The record store across the street), but the room was rather beautiful. As some may have read, the BEDS were probably the most comfortable I have ever slept in, including my own! I think they use plush down comforters, but I slept so beautifully each night.*Breakfast at the Restaurant-I live in Jersey City, across the Hudson from Manhattan. I know expensive places, and am accustomed to them. With that said, I also realize hotels jack up the prices of their food. However, the price of the breakfast was close to $30, quite expensive! Food was pretty good, but this was not the best value.*Bar-The bar was a nice place to relax, watch some sports and get a drink while my girlfriend got ready to go out. The drinks were somewhat expensive, but again, living in the NYC area, I am used to paying $5-7 for a Heineken. This was the same. Besides the pricing, it had a nice ambiance to it*Conceirge-Well, the good news of the trip was that I proposed to my girlfriend, now fiance! The night of the proposal, I wanted to take her to a nice restaurant. The conceirge was so helpful in getting us a nice romantic place to eat at. He was also excited for us. I work in a service oriented industry, where customer service makes or breaks a company. He certainly was very professional and courteous. He even remembered our engagement the next night he was working and congratulated us again!*Location-The location was pretty descent for us. Although my fiance is not into staying in touristy areas, she did enjoy the location of our hotel, as it was close to alot of places and/or public transportation. It was not too far from Fisherman's Wharf, and was a quiet part of town. The only downside to Fisherman's Wharf was the overpriced restuarants serving breakfast. Living in NYC, breakfast is cheap, even in a Manhattan diner. However, here, could not find french toast for less than $10-12. *ParkingWe flew out and took a taxi to the hotel from SFO, so we did not have to pay for parking. However, I did see it was rather expensive, so I would advise not parking in their lot. *OVERALL-This place met all our needs. They were courteous, the beds were extremely comfortable, and you cannot beat the location. I would definitely reccommend this hotel to someone traveling to Fisherman's Wharf!!

I spent many hours trying to decide where to stay. On my last trip in June I chose the Four Seasons; it was a superlative experience and a good value to boot. But I wanted something different. I originally booked the St. Regis, but the numerous Trip Advisor comments about noise worried me; the location of the Ritz Carlton does not appeal to me, so sort of by default that got me to the Mandarin Oriental.After reading all the reviews of this property, I can say that I understand both the positive and the negative comments. No hotel is perfect (or at least I haven't been there yet!), so it really depends on what you value for your money. Let me start with the positives.1. As everyone says, the view is unbeatable. I had an executive king with a view south and west. I could see some of the Bay Bridge, but very little of the Golden Gate. If that view is important to you, you need to book a higher category room. Expect to pay $100-200 more per night for that privilege. And, as others have noted, there is no guarantee that you will have that view if there is thick fog, as there was for most of my stay.2. I loved the layout and decor of the room. In fact, I was shown a bridge to bridge room and a Mandarin king (the pricey one) and the living area in my room was more spacious. The color scheme (red, gold, white) is cheerful yet soothing. The furnishings, art work, throw pillows, bamboo plant, sheer blinds, etc. are all lovely. The bed linens were top of the line, really, really silky smooth. Great air conditioning, although I'm not sure I really needed it in the chilly August fog. 3. The hotel is very quiet for a big city. I think being on the 41st floor keeps out a lot of street noise. I heard doors in the halls, but not people, even on a fully booked Saturday night. There are only about 15 rooms per floor, divided by the walkway, so there just aren't that many guests to make noise. Now for the not so good.1. As a luxury hotel bathroom junkie, the M.O. was a bit disappointing. Mine was a bit small, with a very narrow tub. There are appeared to be three types of wall covering, the ugliest of which is in the separate shower. In the other rooms I saw the walls of the separate shower were marble where mine was just ugly yellow tile. The Mandarin King bath with the tub by the window is lovely, but it does not compare to the bath at the Four Seasons. The towels were a bit scratchy and I didn't care for the toiletries. I went from two bathmats on the first day, to one on the second to none of the third. Housekeeping must have forgotten. But the room itself was super clean.2. The public areas of the hotel are sort of dark and pretty small. I don't spend time in public areas, so this didn't matter to me. But the appeal of the hotel is on the upper floors. It's really too bad that Silks has no natural light windows because it is a pretty space.3. I was on a breakfast package so I had two meals in Silks and one from room service. They were okay. Be aware that you are kept to a $32 per per person maximum for the package. At the Four Seasons they just paid whatever I spent (one breakfast upwards of $50). 4. For the non-smokers: this hotel is pretty lax about smoking in rooms. I was told the only floor where smoking was allowed was on the 48th, but there was definitely a fresh cigarette smell in my 41st floor room on Saturday night. One of the staff told me that they don't charge people for smoking in non-smoking rooms as there are a lot of Asian and European clients who smoke. I found this annoying.5. No wifi the rooms, ethernet connection only. Not enough information about TV channels and no info on PPV. 6. The staff did not impress me much. Check in was chaotic -- the person serving me seemed not to know what she was doing, and there was a problem processing my credit card. It turns out it was the M.O. system and not my card, but the 15 minutes spent trying to figure this out was embarassing and annoying. I found the breakfast server unfriendly.But these negatives do not outweigh the positives, and all things considered, I would definitely stay here again. The price was reasonable for a luxury hotel in one of the world's greatest cities, and I really, really loved the room. The pictures posted on trip advisor and on the hotel website are accurate.

Since I used to live in SF and travel their quite frequently for work, I am quite familiar with the city and knew we would want to stay in union square (as my boyfriend has never been there and this is the best &quot;touristy&quot; spot). I usually prefer to stay at the Sir Francis Drake or the Westin St. Francis but both were overbooked. I was left with the Clift and Hotel Nikko. I definiately made the wrong choice even though I had heard good things about the lounge and restaurant. Since I have stayed at the Morgan (NYC) several times I assumed we would have a pleasant experience and I LOVE Asia de Cuba in NYC. I was wrong!  When we arrived at the Clift, the doorman did not even open the door or even aknowledge our pressence. Check-in was smooth but the girl was certainly rushing us and annoyed with any questions. Our original plan was to spend our first night with dinner at Asia De Cuba and start off with some early evening cocktails at the Redwood Room. BIG MISTAKE. Upon check-in we asked if we needed reservations for the Redwood Room. The girl gave us some &quot;preferred customer&quot; cards of some sort which she explained would get us right in with no problem. We approached the hostess at about 730 pm. There were a couple of guys in front of us whom the hostess was assisting. As we patiently waited, a large group came up behind us. The matron of the group approached the hostess - cutting in front of everyone else AND interrupting the conversation between the hostess and the 2 guys. Rather than telling this RUDE woman to go stand in line actually assisted her! The guys in front of us looked apalled and we were infuriated. Once it was finally our turn (like that mattered to the hostess) she very rudely told us we couldnt come in without a reservation. She said she had people arriving at 9 pm. We explained we just wanted ONE pre-dinner cocktail. At this point she got even more rude. At this point we decided this was NOT a place we wanted to spend out money anyways. They obviously dont care about their actual guests! The scene was horrible anyways. I dont think there was a patron under the age of 65 in the entire bar.... so much for a &quot;hip&quot; bar scene. We tried to complain to a manager but he was too busy having a personal conversation with one of the doormen. We decided our money is better spent elsewhere and opted against dinner in the hotel. We had a lovely meal in the Marina district then went on to drinks at Matrix where our patronage was appreciated and our drinks were not accompanied with a side of rudeness. I might also point out the martinis are $8 at Matrix as opposed to the overpriced drinks Redwood Room with serve you along with their snooty attitude. We are from LA so we are no strangers to attitude but this was just plain RUDE.  Aside from the horrible experience our first night, the hotel lobby is quite nice. The rooms are VERY small and somewhat dirty. The bathroom is appalling - dirty towels, the fan doesnt work, no standing room. On our final day, the anger from night one had worn off slightly (probably because we spent as little time in the hotel as possible). We were packing our stuff and relaxing from a morning of shopping. The day before, housekeeping entered our room even though we had the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign on the door. Since nothing was taken we ignored it. Now here we are, a mere hour from escaping the Clift, when there is a knock at the door...housekeeping. I explain we are leaving at 1 (check out time) and to please respect the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign. 15 minutes later, another knock at the door. It is the housekeeper AGAIN. I tell her &quot;we are still here&quot; and remind her of our departure time. Sure enough, another knock at the door and who could it be? The SAME housekeeper. At this point we are so frustrated my boyfriend tells her to wait outside and we gather all our stuff (half packed and all). They clearly wanted us gone so we sprinted to the elevator checked out and left the Clift behind.  Trust me, the Clift offers NOTHING to validate such horrible attitudes and behavior. I had high hopes for this place and if they had impressed me, I would have considered staying there on my monthly business trips up to SF. Forget it. I will definately tell everyone I know NOT to stay here and I will probably never stay at the Morgan again either just because of the Clift affiliation. Trust me, you are better off at the Sir Francis Drake or the Westin. At least they know you exist there and are gracious for your patronage.

The price through their &quot;Cheap is Chic&quot; special on their website was $109, which can't be beat for the central location. THE GOOD: Cheap!! Great Location!! It's within walking distance to everything around Union Square- The square itself, the shopping, the theatres (it's right across the street from one), restaurants, the Market-Powell Cable Car line (takes you to Fisherman's Wharf for $5/one way), Chinatown, Civic Center, Nob Hill, etc. There's a drugstore (it was either a Walgreens or Eckerds) about a block or less away which is convenient and there's a Starbucks right next door. There's also a Borders bookstore several blocks away, about a 6 minute walk. The decor was great (although I did overhear an older couple complaining about how it was &quot;too modern&quot;). It's decorated in greys, blues, with punches of orange and a lot of metal (the furniture and &quot;headboard&quot;) (you can check it out on the website). The room and bathroom were both super clean and well equipped. There are a selection of magazines (NYLON, a local fashion magazine, etc.), the toiletries smell amazing, and there's a cute little welcome bag with freebies and goodies in there like emergen-C, toothpaste, an energy drink sample, Nivea face body cream, etc. There's also a distinct &quot;DIVA!&quot; theme or &quot;personality&quot; (as they call it) throughout your stay, which may strike some as being over the top and definitely oriented to a young, hip, female crowd. (I thought it was fun and a welcome change from stuffier hotels but my fiance definitely rolled his eyes a couple times). There's a small desk and chair, a comfy bed (super smooth sheets), a dresser (it looks like a lateral file cabinet) and the tv is wall-mounted (like in a hospital). There's an iron and ironing board, safe, and full-length mirror in the closet. The bathroom also had really nice modern fixtures. There are &quot;offices&quot; on several floors with a computer and internet access (but no printer). There is also AIR CONDITIONING!! A lot of places in San Francisco don't have air conditioning since it's usually pretty cool but it's nice for the rare &quot;heat wave&quot; like the one they had recently. The service is incredible! The concierge was helpful for arranging our transportation to the airport, as well as fielding our questions about the area.THE &quot;BAD&quot;: Note, most of these observations aren't unique to The Diva since they pretty much apply to any of the boutique hotels in the area. The rooms are small, but any decent hotel in the Union Square area at this price will be small- Even then, it's only really small if there are two people staying in the room. And the decor more than makes up for it. I would rather stay at a nice, clean, modern place than get a larger room in a depressing motel-ish place. Try to get a room away from the street- Our room faced Geary Street and it gets pretty loud at night. Turning on the air conditioning / fan helped mask the noise and it didn't bother my fiance but I slept with earplugs. (It didn't bother me enough to ask for a different room). There's no minifridge and the cable TV options were pretty poor (although, again, you're probably not in Union Square to sit around, eating from your minifridge, and watching a lot of TV! The one thing that was kind of annoying was how dark it was since the lamps weren't that strong.The location is perfectly safe- There are a lot of affluent shops around Union Square so people forget that San Francisco has a huge, HUGE homeless population and a huge, HUGE drug problem. And that it's a pretty dirty city (like NYC dirty but better since there aren't as many people). You may smell the distinct odor of pee on one street and then you'll be standing in front of a swanky shop. You're going to be aware of people asking you for change, food, etc. It's not like you're on the streets of Calcutta, but you'll pretty much see a homeless person or junky on every street. Occasionally, someone might start going crazy and yelling at someone or no one in particular on the street (this happened to me). But there are tons of people out and about (due to the theatre-goers and restaurants and bars) so we felt comfortable, even relatively late at night. Most of the hotels lining Geary street have 24-hour doormen or people at the front desk, which gives you the comforting sense that there are at least several eyes and ears open at all times to the street. Who Will Not Enjoy Union Square / The Diva Hotel: If you are looking for quaint, warm, or traditional, you probably won't like The Diva since you may feel the decor at the hotel is too industrial or &quot;cold&quot; and modern. And on a delicate note...If you're part of an &quot;older crowd&quot; used to staying at large established chain hotels, you may not like The Diva since it definitely has an almost aggressively youthful &quot;tone&quot; which can be interpreted as fun, or annoying, depending on your point of view. Also, like my fiance's parents, if you're going to be uncomfortable staying in an area that is vibrant and centrally located but definitely urban and somewhat seedy looking on some streets and with a population of homeless people and drug addicts, then stay at the hermetically sealed (and very nice but expensive) Westin in the area, or at one of the nice hotels on bucolic Nob Hill (trust me, no panhandlers will be trekking up those ridiculously steep hills). We also stayed at the Savoy (and ate at the Millenium for about 5 days, leaving with thinner wallets and fatter waistlines) and wrote a review of those on Tripadvisor as well if you're interested!Have a great time in San Francisco!

We reserved the hotel's town car one weekday morning to go to Union Square along with another guest which was a fantastic service. The breakfast buffet was delicious (hard-boiled eggs, oatmeal, bagels, breads, croissants, fruit, meat and cheeses) and our coffee was refilled at our table each morning.

We would probably have been much happier ordering any of the panini offered by the hotel. The Hotel Drisco is in a beautiful neighborhood (Pacific Heights) and we enjoyed walking around to see the gorgeous mansions and views of the bay. We used the nearby bus stop - only 2 or 3 blocks away - since we had purchased MUNI Passports though I recommend taking taxis to save time or walking if your destination isn't too far . (We walked to Union Street one day with no problem, then on to the Marina district and took a taxi back.) We had a rental car a couple days and parking was challenging one night but we were able to find a space only a block away. The second night we went to the same street and there were plenty of spaces available so it was really just a matter of knowing where to go. Check-out was friendly and efficient.

A few things weren't entirely perfect--one of the bedspreads in our two-double-bed room had a small hole in it and, like one of the other reviewers, we wondered about the extra supports holding up the top two floors (I meant to ask but never got around to it). The aging elevator also gave us a taste of what an earthquake might be like each time it came to a stop and made carrying a breakfast tray back to our third-floor room a bit of a challenge. On the other hand, the kids thought it was great. Other than those little glitches, however, we were quite pleased with everything--the palm trees and hammocks were fun, the breakfast, although not huge, was fresh and tasty and the location was close to restaurants and a Muni stop.

The price was really a steal. We stayed in the Studio Suite which was really nice and not too cramped. The bed was really comfortable, as were the pillows. I was impressed because usually pillows are way too puffy, big, and uncomfortable in most hotels. We stayed on the 6th floor and had a nice partial view of the Bay Bridge. The staff was very friendly and accommodating, and the concierge was really helpful during the entire 3 night stay. The bathroom was kind of small for this type of room in my opinion, but it was nice and the shower pressure was great and the water was hot. The lobby is pretty small and nothing too impressive, but decent enough. We also liked the location--just a few blocks from BART, and easy to catch public transportation or walk to other areas. We really enjoyed our stay here but for the following which happened twice!Our first night there after getting up at about 1:30 am to use the restroom, the guest next door was talking and laughing on her phone extremely loud. We happened to have a room with a partition, which could open up to a room next door (in those cases where you get 2 adjoining rooms). To her, it probably didn't seem loud, but it felt like she was in our room and it was really hard to get back to sleep. We almost moved to a new room the next night--the hotel was very accommodating with this request--but we figured it was just a chance of bad luck, and if it happened again we could call down and complain and the problem would be solved immediately. We should have moved!! The next night was fine. On the third night, we went to bed around 11 pm and were exhausted. To my surprise, at 2 AM, while in a DEEP sleep, I was suddenly awakened by these REALLY loud women speaking a foreign language and screaming/laughing. However, it wasn't even coming from the partition side (which is why the first night I figured we could hear the one lady) but on the other side of our room! The ladies were being really obnoxious and loud and it was unacceptable, so we called down to complain and security was sent up. The voices came down, but you could still hear people talking, even though they were not talking loud. I've never experienced that in any other hotel, unless people are in the hallway or someone is having a raging party next door. The next day I was really tired and disappointed that I didn't get a good's night sleep before traveling home.

The toilet and shower were separate from the vanity, which was nice. The room did not have a mini-bar or a dresser. Since the room was small, we had suitcases every where.Our boys had room service several times as my husband were going out for dinner. The service was quick (20 minutes or so) and the food was very good and excellently transported. For example, the milks and ice cream were kept on ice to keep them cold. The staff was friendly.

As I said, two cable car lines stop in front of the hotel, which is nice, but they can be extremely crowded and you may need to be aggressive if you have stood at the cable car stop for awhile only to be pushed out of the way by others running for the car as it stops.This was a nice hotel, located in a pretty and historical area. Nob Hill was the center of old San Francisco wealth in the early 20th century. It is close to some interesting sites (but not Fisherman's Wharf although the cable cars take you directly there.)

The washroom was tiny and the tiles were caved in around the faucet and appeared to be rotten underneath. The rooms are also extremely small. I do not know if this is all rooms, or just the second class rooms that they relegate people who do not book directly through their site to. We asked for guest robes and were told we would have to &quot;sign them out&quot; (again, duplicating the treatment of an earlier reviewer who felt like a criminal). The location is the only positive feature...but it is not worth it! There are so many nicer (and less expensive) hotels in the area with the same location.When we checked in (in the early afternoon) there were still dirty breakfast dishes (with dead flies floating in the orange juice) left outside our door in the hallway. It was dirty and dingy. We requested an in room fridge (none were available) and to get ice we had to walk to a different building, and then up an elevator and down a hall. I felt very poorly treated. For the amount of money that they charge, this hotel is not worth it. It is not the same class or standards that you might expect from other hotels in the Sheraton line.

We took the advice of the people who had submitted reviews on this site and we did ask for a courtyard room. We received this category of room both times and were very happy with the fact that we did not hear any street noise at all! Every evening from 5:00 - 6:00 they have complimentary wine and beer in their lobby by the fireplace. It really is a great atmosphere. The hotel is close to Fisherman's Wharf and the cable car lines. We were also able to walk to North Beach (a must do) as well as Lombard Street. The staff is wonderful to deal with and very helpful if you need directions or advice.

I figured even if I could not be assured of the exact location I desired, I would be able to count on a decent room. Basically this is what I got. The room itself was fine, if a bit dark (we were on the 8th floor). This is a very large hotel (39 floors) with a lobby that never sleeps in an area that seems pretty busy all the time as well. Location: If you go south on Market, more to the heart of the financial district, things are nice, the sidewalks clean, and even a few trees planted here and there. If you go north on Market, the streets gets dirtier, and the stores seedier. Sixth street, which is two blocks up, is particularly &quot;unscenic.&quot; Fourth St., where the hotel is located, appears to be the cutoff point for the neighborhood. Also, if the main entrance was on Market, rather than Fourth, it would be a big improvement. The main entrance is recessed, which is prob. appreciated when it rains, but looks dark and grungy, and the sidewalk on Fourth is narrow, which makes it crowded with all the tourists streaming in and out. Interiors: The interiors are fine, generally speaking, but one morning I walked to the elevator to find a pile of Cheetos on the floor, some of which had been ground into the carpeting. It was still there 2-3 hours later. Same thing with gum wrappers. This type of thing skeeves me out. The lobby is glitzy. There is a waterfall somewhere (used to mitigate lobby noise) and things like chandeliers and marble. However, all this being said, the basics were fine, and I could stand the shortcomings given that we had gotten a decent discount through Priceline. Still, I could not help but think everyone else passing through the lobby had gotten the same deal.In sum,the pros: *two blocks from the BART station*decent rooms with comfortable beds and nice bathrooms*friendly, professional front desk staffthe cons: *dark, recessed entrance in slightly borderline area (in my opinion)*hallways outside rooms could be cleaner (saw ground Cheetos and bits of toilet paper on the carpeting)*a bit of nickel and diming (Internet and parking--parking is $49/day) but I suppose this is to be expected at a hotel that caters to business travelers who are getting reimbursed by their companies anyway ANSWERNOTFOUND",This is a very large hotel (39 floors) with a lobby that never sleeps in an area that seems pretty busy all the time as well,"(269, 393)",5,0.6190476190476191,True

There is also not any space in the hotel where it is comfortable to sit. The lobby has tables and chairs and is constantly freezing due to poor design.

We've stayed at this W property around 5 times now.When greeted at the front desk upon arrival, the clerks are always pleasant, but this time there were probably 4 other groups of people checking in at the same time we were (around 4 p.m. on a Friday). The only problem is that everyone standing near the front desk heard every bit of everyone else's business, including room numbers and other stuff. It was kind of uncomfortable, and I'm used to a more professional check-in environment at the W.Upon getting to our room, we had an upper floor room designated for a bay view. Well, the bay view is disappearing fast with new big buildings being built in downtown San Francisco. One high-rise in particular has blocked a huge section of the view now so it's not the same as it used to be if you haven't been there for awhile. A couple of years ago, we had the &quot;city view,&quot; which is nice, especially during the holidays when the nearby park close to the Metreon is lit.The rooms are always nice and the W hotels always have a signature smell inside, which is wonderful. I have no idea what fragrance they use (and I was told by one of the clerks in the Bliss Spa on site that it is indeed a signature scent that is not sold anywhere on the property).This was the first time we ever noticed thin walls between rooms at the W. Either the rooms next to ours in the past were unoccupied or the people were extremely quiet. This time, we could hear actual conversations in the room next to ours and it was uncomfortable to say the least. One bad thing (or good, depending on how you look at it) is that the hotel is often a &quot;party&quot; type hotel, where you have a number of 20somethings who can be very noisy. Now that we're in our late 30s, it's beginning to get kind of annoying. :-) We heard a lot of door slamming and a lot of loud laughing in the halls at times like 3 a.m. and stuff like that.The Bliss Spa on site was very nice and the staff there was excellent... helpful and friendly and I'd give them an A plus.Some drawbacks are the ridiculous prices for the honor bar in the room. A $5 Reese's peanut butter cup? Are they kidding? And there are no soda machines anywhere on the property. We called their &quot;whatever whenever&quot; number at the hotel and were told that we could order room service if we wanted a pepsi or something similar. Ugh. We ordered breakfast from room service one morning and it was pretty standard fare... good but certainly not outstanding or unique in any way.Overall, it's a very nice hotel and you can't beat the location. The rooms could use some tweaking though. There wasn't even a sleep timer on the TV, and it wouldn't hurt the W to begin investing in plasma TVs. They want to be considered upscale yet they stick with older television sets, which is kind of strange. Their bathrooms are well-designed and very nice. We will probably stay at the W again but it's not quite as fine of a property as it used to be a few years ago. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3088, 3102)",1,0.0,False

It's really the best of both worlds - a clean upscale service hotel with the charm and hospitality of a small San Francisco boutique. Take note of the wonderful staff at Huntington. The service staff are efficient and down-to-earth (a surprise on your pillow every night), and the doormen, bell and concierge are fantastic. When we arrived, the front desk gave us a warm welcome and even offered some great suggestions for a Hawaii vacation (plus we got an upgrade on our room!). The front desk (wish I had his name) was truly, truly wonderful and had a great personality.The hotel's location is perfect. It's gracefully situated in the beautiful and quiet neighborhood of Nob Hill, one of the most desirable areas in the city. You can use car service to get around, but a cable car (the California) is right outside the front entrance, but China Town and Union Square are within walking distance. We had no trouble at all walking the steep streets of Nob Hill - it was actually quite fun and part of the whole San Francisco experience! Our room overlooked Huntington Park and Grace Cathedral. Peet's Coffee is located in the Cathedral, and the famous Sears Fine Foods is not far. In the morning, you can join the Chinese for Tai Chi classes in the park, swim in the hotel infinity pool, or take advantage of the Yoga classes or other spa offerings at the hotel's Nob Hill Spa.This is a great hotel. We researched dozens of hotels before happily finding The Huntington. If you've been researching the many hotels of San Francisco and are still undecided, I would say stop looking and book The Huntington now.

The all-day tea &amp; coffee (good tea and coffee, by the way) was appreciated, and the fresh-baked cookies were a treat.

I actually had one of the smallest rooms, but it was cozy, clean, comfortable and had a big closet. This is NOT a Hilton, Marriott or any other big chain hotel -- Thank Goodness! This hotel has lots of character; the furnishings are antiquey; and the whole thing has quiet elegance. I was on the fifth floor &amp; could hear the cable car go by (I like to keep the window open). It didn't bother me, but I suppose you could ask for a quieter room in the back if you are particularly sensitive to street noise.

We had booked the room directly through their website, and secured a 'hot dates' rate of $99 per night. We planned to stay in San Franscico for 5 nights as the first leg of our 2-week California stay, so we definitely wanted something not too pricey but hopefully nice. The Serrano definitely fit this criteria. The lobby area of the hotel is interesting &amp; tasteful; I loved the decor of this area (sort of chic vintage Morroccan...perhaps a bit Casablanca-like &amp; old Hollywood), with all sorts of interesting things to look at. The bedrooms had a similar theme and were really quite lovely. Ours was on the fifth floor and didn't have a great view (basically the side of a concrete building) and the room wasn't terribly large, but we didn't spend much time there anyways. Contrary to what other reviews have mentioned, our bathroom was actually quite spacious, although the shelving for toiletries is a little limited (they provided Aveda toiletries, by the way, which was very nice). The tub was fairly deep although I was disappointed because it was a little short for my long legs (I am 5'10&quot;)!! The linens on the bed were lovely, I found the bed very comfortable, there was a spacious walk-in closet, terry cloth robes &amp; a huge mirror on the wall by the bed. Although we didn't buy anything (the hotel is less than a block away from a Walgreens), there was a nice selection in the mini-bar.The location of the hotel is actually quite good. Some people have complained about homeless and feeling unsafe, but I think this is a bit ridiculous. This hotel is in a very busy, bustling area of the city, full of shops and restaurants, so as long as you don't stray too far south (and you should be able to tell immediately when you have done so because things start to get shady), you'll be fine. There are always lots of people around, even at night. For breakfast, I would recommend two places: David's Delicatessen (around the corner) and the Taylor St. Coffee Shop (just down the block.) David's is a Jewish deli with 1950's style diner seating, and cooks up a mean set of Fresh Apple Pancakes and Scrambled Eggs with lox...I am getting hungry just thinking about it! But this place is a bit pricey; my boyfriend ate here several mornings with our bill totalling over $30. More reasonably priced (we saved about $10 each time we ate here) is the Taylor St. Coffee Shop. This place is smaller but very friendly. The kitchen is in the open at the front of the restaurant and every member of staff thanked us as we left each morning. My favorite was a super yummy entre of eggs with guacamole, bacon bits, tomato and hashbrowns for $6.99 - great value. Also serve a fantastic fresh OJ. This place has a retro feel with photos of Marilyn, James Dean &amp; other classic stars adorning the walls. But back to the Serrano - I think the excellent staff and the attention to customer service is one of the biggest ways this hotel is a standout. We were ALWAYS greeted by a member of staff upon entering the hotel, and even the staff taking luggage up or downstairs on the elevator were friendly enough to say hello and strike up short conversations. We missed the wine tasting one evening by a few minutes and the concierge overseeing it (didn't catch his name) was nice enough to bring us up our own bottle!!! This hotel has obviously made customer service a top priority and it shows, blowing most hotels I have stayed with out of the water. We would definitely stay here, especially if we secured another 'hot date' rate. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3603, 3617)",1,0.0,False

Since the airline restrictions on liquids were so strict, I asked about shipping the breastmilk home. The concierge was able to point us to a shipping store that provided insulated boxes. She also arranged for me to bring the milk to her so that she could store it in the freezer. I was amazed at how professionally she handled herself and how truly helpful she was. The other concierge, William, sent us to a FABULOUS Italian restaurant while we were there. The name of it was La Gondola. It was really romantic. If you were walking very fast you'd walk right past it. I think it only seated about 15 people. The food was great, too. Everyone there spoke Italian, so we just sort of pointed at the menu. It was a wonderful dinner.We did order room service a couple of times. Our food arrived quickly and everything we ate was great. On our last day there we ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant.

This wasn't a problem for us, as we still had Regency club access and were still high enough to have a lovely view. The rooms were average at best. Nothing that special, except that the beds were fantastic. Small TV in bathroom was a nice perk.REGENCY CLUB: If you have the extra $$$, by all means upgrade to the Regency club. There is breakfast every morning (i.e. croissants, bagels, cereal, TONS of fresh fruit, cheese, ham, juice, coffee etc) and a cocktail hour from 4-7 pm which includes hot appetizers, dips, sodas (wine/spirits $4.00/each). But the real reason to join the regency club is: the view fantastic overlooking Coit Tower, the Bay. Who wouldn't want to wake up to this every morning?! The Regency club is on the 32nd floor.LOCATION: You cannot beat the location of this hotel. This is reason enough to stay here.GYM: Not bad, but small. Three treadmills makes for a bit of a squeeze in the a.m. for a run.GRANDVIEWS RESTAURANT: Located on the the top floor (36) this restaurant had good food and great service. The views were excellent, similar to Regency club views except they also have views facing the West. Open for breakfast too.Skip the rest as it does not pertain to the Hotel per se:RESTAURANTS:Gary Danko: Booked two months in advance to get a table for four. Service was great but food wasn't as spectacular as one would expect. Postrio: Wolfgang Puck's restuarant. Fantastic food. Try to get there if you can.Alioto's: On Fisherman's wharf. Request a table with a view of the bay. Seafood is excellent despite that the place looks like a bit of a tourist trap.The Slanted Door: Please, if you love Vietnamese foods, please go here! The Imperial Rolls were amazing. Located in the Ferry Building. Nice views of the Bay Bridge. Very crowded, very noisy. Horizon's: (Saulsalito) lovely views of the Bay, great food.

The lobby was very pretty and I remember there was a pretty mural either out front or in the lobby that made it stand out as more unique and not cookie cutter motel-ish. The free wine tasting every night was a wonderful extra and welcomed relaxment in between a long day of sightseeing and evenings out. That and also the free coffee and tea (and a variety of tea which I liked) every morning were little extras that we felt made you feel like a welcomed guest and that they are going out of their way to make the hotel special.

Zingari, the hotel's second-floor restaurant-lounge, offers half-price appetizers and $5 house wines from 4-7 p.m. The portions were sufficiently large to serve as dinner for us the night we arrived.The continental breakfast provided excellent orange juice along with oranges, apples, muffins, croissants, breakfast pastries, tea, and coffee in the Club Room on the hotel's top floor.

The rooms have double windows so the street noise isn't a problem, however the rooms aren't airconditioned so if you wanted more breeze/air than what the ceiling fan can provide and opened the window at night it might be noisy. This wasn't an issue for us in early May. The rooms have a large flat scren TV, hairdryer, and an iron and ironing board if you ask for one. There is a coin operated laundry in the basement, which they don't tell you about, insted promoting their &quot;laundry service&quot; at about US$5 an item. We were travelling for a month, and spent 6 nights at this hotel, and needed to wash frequently so we were thrilled to find the laundry in the basement.

One thing to note though: if you leave the door open after taking a shower, the steam will drift into your room, as there is no fan in there (something to keep in mind as you use the bathroom other times).The king size bed is very, very comfy.

This special rate did not allow us to upgrade to include continental breakfast for an additional $1.00. A few days after our stay, Travelzoo published a special rate for the hotel: $89/night.The boutique hotel was elegant and more personal than the Hilton. The staff was very friendly.

The staff is generally professional and helpful.The lobby is a bit small and it can be difficult to get past all the doormen to get to the desk. Mind you, they are friendly and willing to help, but often there are 3 standing right in front of the doors, sometimes one is on the staircase leading into the hotel, so it feels like you are sneaking past the Secret Service every time you enter the hotel. At some hotels the doormen quickly open the door and get out of your way but here they are usually in conversation and don't notice you until you are already past.Speaking of small, the rooms are on the small side as well, which is not too uncommon for an older property. Don't waste your time on a &quot;premium&quot; room as the extra square footage is mostly in a long hallway that isn't useable. On paper these rooms are larger but they end up feeling the same size.Premium rooms also have two televisions but unfortunately the Omni is one of those hotels that has upgraded to 'high-def&quot; TVs but not high-def programming. Everything on screen is stretched wide to fill the wider screen, which ends up making everything all distorted - all the actors look squat and fat. Some hotels allow you to set the TV back to the regular aspect ratio to fix this, but not the Omni. I guess they don't want the black bars on the sides of the screens. But the result is that they can claim to have high-quality TVs while the picture quality is actually worse than your average Holiday Inn.Premium rooms offer &quot;a courtyard view&quot;. Be aware that this means you will probably get some light through the window but the actual &quot;view will be of a wall, or large machinery. Definitely nothing you would take a picture of if you aren't an HVAC engineer.If they are busy don't gamble on a smoking room unless you really don't mind the smell. The Omni gets a lot of heavy smokers so those rooms truly reek.The hotel restaurant is okay, basic big-city hotel food (at very high prices) but nothing to get excited about.All in all, if you can book during a slow period when you can easily change rooms to find one more to your liking then the Omni is an acceptable downtown hotel. But when reservations are scarce you are better off at a more reliable property. ANSWERNOTFOUND",and tries to offer decent service,"(31, 64)",1,0.5333333333333333,True

Even on the 10th floor we could hear conversations from the sidewalk below, the trash collection early in the morning sounded like it was right outside our window, and when a Harley went by it felt like we were inside the tailpipe. Maybe there is something going on with the outside acoustics here...Here's a tip: hotels in the business district aren't busy on the weekends. We went on priceline and bid $99/night for four-star hotels in this area; priceline counter-offered at $120/night and we were in business. Compare to $300/night on hilton's website.

Sure, the rooms are small, have old furniture, bland decor, and some of the carpeting looked worn, but everything was clean, the bed was comfortable, the shower had good water pressure, and you can't beat the great location in Cole Valley, a quiet residential neighborhood near the light rail line...One block away is Cole Street, where you can grab coffee or breakfast, and only a few blocks to Haight St, where even more restaurants and stores are..Also very close to Golden Gate Park, which is a great way to spend the day...The two &quot;negatives&quot;: the light rail line runs right in front of the hotel, so at night, you can periodically hear and feel it as it goes by (after the first night, it didn't bother me at all). The other slight negative is that there is no one on duty in the early AM or late at night, so if you need info. or want to check out, you may not find someone to help you. Because I was leaving at 6am, I checked out the night before, which was no problem.Other than those two small issues, the Carl was a great place to stay, and if you're just using your hotel as a place to sleep and take a shower, it's the perfect choice.

Although the closet is huge, the bathroom is very tiny with literally no counter space.

The woman at the front desk during check-in asked whether I preferred a high or low floor and then put me on the second floor. I also asked to be located away from the elevator so she put me directly across from one.

The toiletries in the bathroom were good quality but It seemed that toilet paper was being rationed as I had to ask for an extra roll. I also didn't receive my copy of the Sunday Times on Sunday.

The kitchenette was useful again for a morning tea or an evening coffee and to warm milk for our children (using the microwave oven). We had a problem with our fridge/freezer and the staff sorted this out quickly.

Tips on where best to eat were as good as before, though some of the venues recommended had changed since our last visit. The staff were also very happy to guide the visitor around the city providing a take-away map for added assistance.Parking was $25 + tax per day, but this is not unreasonable for the city. The free internet access was a very useful.The complimentary breakfast was a bonus and, as it is free, can be passed over if one feels the need of a more substantial breakfast.Don and the team at the Grosvenor Suites have done it again for us.

We wanted a spot near Fisherman's Wharf, however the hotel we originally booked was beginning renovations and all other hotels in that area were booked. Parc 55 and Union Square seemed the next best option. The location is great, it's less than a block to the Market/Powell cable car turnaround. All of Union Square is convient as well. However, the other side of the hotel seemed kind of sketchy. Our room was a standard king bed room on the 17th floor. The view was great as we overlooked all the skyscrapers in San Francisco. The bed was comfy, flat panel TV was a nice touch, and the bathroom was spacious and nicely appointed. The only problem I would point out is the noise. My wife and I live in a small apartment on a busy street so we are used to it, but I did notice that you can hear people in the rooms around you quite clearly. Also, despite being on the 17th floor, I could hear the traffic outside (along with the bell rining from the cable cars). Again, we are used to the noise so it was no problem for us, however I can see why some people may be bothered. The staff was more than friendly and helpful. They even allowed us to check in 3 hours early (we just drove 4 hours from Yosemite and badly needed to relax and freshen up before exploring the city).

The location also allows it to have fantastic views of the city, with bay views on one side and Union Square on the other. Our room was spacious, comfortable and very clean. The wardrobe was also sufficient with enough room for all our shopping. The bathroom is also equally roomy, with great amenities. Our room had fabulous views overlooking Union Square and also provided great views of the sunrise each morning. Since we booked an executive room, we had access to the business lounge for breakfast and early evening hors d'oeuvres. The lounge had great views of the bay, if you got in early enough to grab the seats. My only issue is that the lounge is not big enough for the number of people who have access to it. We were fortunate to get seats whenever we needed it, but there were a few people who were made to stand around waiting for a seat. The hors d'oeuvres in the evening were also great. You would also find substantial meals being supplied as well, such as pasta. So you would end up having a late dinner. Service in the lounge was the friendly and courteous.

Extra blanket in closet for those who would rather tuck in instead of turn up the heat.

Why advertise offering free in room dvd's if all you have is old but not classic b movies?Towel heaters needed in rooms would help cut use of towels and a great touch since heat goes off when you leave room.

This time we opted for room in the newer addition and found it more in line with my expectations of a Westin. This blending of the classic old lobby, restaurants and bar, with the newer bigger and nicer room worked perfectly, although initially it almost seemed like heresy not to stay in the original older building.Westin was the first chain to adopt a deluxe signature bed and their Heavenly Bed is so nice I bought one for my home bedroom. The bathroom was recently updated with new fixtures. Our room had a wonderful view stretching from Nob Hill to the Bay Bridge. Ask for a higher floor if view is important to you.The more expensive a hotel is, the more likely they'll charge for things like internet access that are free in lesser hotels.

While the internet was nice and convenient and I was happy to get tons of airline miles, the hotel itself left a lot to be desired.

The room and the entire hotel had this really strange odor which never really went away the whole time I was here, and the TV had far fewer channels than practically every hotel I've stayed at before.The excercise room was okay. Nothing special but it had everything I needed (treadmill and stairmaster) so I can't complain too much about that. As I mentioned, the in-room wireless internet was nice but it sure did break down a bunch, at least twice a day. It was always back up and running an hour or so later, but still an inconvenience. I should also mention that the room was pretty quiet (besides the creaky floors and loud pipes), since they gave me a room that faced the &quot;courtyard&quot; instead of Geary Street, but I've heard it can get really loud if you get a room facing the street so definitely keep that in mind if you decide to stay here.The only reason I give the hotel 2 dots out of 5 instead of 1 is due to the free internet as well as the decent location.

There was a good selection to get your day started - juice, coffee, tea, milk, cereals, toast, bagels, yogurt, bananas, eggs (either scrambled or omlette which seemed to be prepacked and microwaved), bacon and/or sausage. The hotel was full on the weekend and the breakfast bar was quite busy at times. I felt the hotel did a great job of refilling things and we never had to wait long for anything. We always also managed to find a table for our group of 4.There were a couple of minor things we noted. While the hotel looked great, it is very basic and didn't have any nice little &quot;extras&quot;.

I had hoped that the front desk could get me a milk - the breakfast room was just a few steps away - but they were unable to help as their &quot;house man&quot; was not on duty.

Not only did they price us double the price we orginally got but also did understand the connection of having already booked a room for the next two nights. So instead I called priceline and booked a room for a much lower price. I have to admit I rather deal with priceline than direct service with Hyatt. Which says alot about Hyatt's overall customer service. But the bummer or reason for this low review is that after we left on Sunday they charged two charges on a debt card that was only used for the bar. This debt card was not used to hold the rooms nor were they given to the front desk. We called to ask about the charges and they say they could not help us. Only the accounting department could help. We asked them how was it possible not to be able to tell us what the charges were for. The lady on the line say its because they we a high end hotel therefore other departments took care of such things. Told us the accounting department will call us. They did not after two days!

The street noise was pretty bad and we were woken up a few times because of this. There were a few homeless people who would sit on the street outside and make a ton of noise throughout the night.

The fridge is fully stocked but like any other hotel, the prices are high. There is a Walgreens down the street from the hotel where you can stock up on water or snack. There are a lot of restaurants in the area. Some a bit expensive but it's expected as SF as a whole is expensive. There are 3 Starbucks coffee houses near the hotel. If you like to shop, the hotel is minutes from Union Square and is also within walking distance to Chinatown. We actually walked from Pier 39 and it didn't seem far at all. SF has reliable and efficient transportation that is fairly priced in case you don't want to walk. I don't recall the exact price for parking since we flew but most of the hotels charge from $40 and up per night. Overall we had a great stay at this hotel. I highly recommend it and would stay here again. ANSWERNOTFOUND",elevator is fairly,"(1311, 1329)",1,0.9,True

We arrived Friday, late afternoon. No valet parking for my husband, he can't stand to see someone else drive his car, so we spent some time trying to find access to the Union Square Garage (right across the street from the hotel) to park the car. This is a nice feature when you finally get into the garage, much cheaper than paying the valet to park your car in the exact same parking garage. I think we paid $67 for friday-sunday stay, where as the St. Francis charges $50 a day, I believe. Wheeled our luggage across the street to the St. Francis, which had a bustling entrance, cabs in line, valet dudes at the ready, and a steady stream of people walking in and out of the revolving door. When we walked into the hotel, I just wanted to concentrate on getting checked in, so I have to admit to not really noticing the nice entry hall/lobby area of the hotel, although later on, when I had time, I was appreciative. There was a line to check in, but it moved quickly. We booked via Expedia, which I perhaps incorrectly suspect gives us a worse chance of getting a good room, and when I found out we were on the 4th floor, above Union Square, my suspicions were confirmed. We were booked in the older part of the hotel, which I was a bit excited about, ambiance and all that corny stuff. Plus, with no kids on the trip, the character of the older rooms would not be such a big deal. So, up to the fourth floor, big beautiful hallways, marble floor molding, wainscoting, tastefully decorated all the way. Walking into our room, the sheer size of it was impressive. We had booked a King room, and there was plenty of space around the bed to walk, along with two sitting chairs (not comfortable at all) and a small desk and business-type chair (which didn't really go with the decor). The room had a closet, a minibar, flat screen tv, coffee maker with Starbucks and a safe. Nice big window in there as well, overlooking a noisy street. The bath was small, but tastefully decorated. My husband loved the room. He can sleep through anything, so he had some great sleeps during our stay. I am a light sleeper and heard the street noise, which included a band on Friday night right below our window, the usual city sirens, and the banging of the doors in the hallway of the other guests. The bed, I must say, was quite comfortable. It was nice to be in a hotel room without Spongebob on the t.v.! Our experience at the bar later that night was enjoyable, although the prices were a bit steep for us Nevadans. They did serve a wonderful martini though! Coming back from our concert at 2:00 a.m., the hotel lobby was still quite a happening place! It was nice to come back to this beautiful room after a loud, two hour mind numbing concert. Overall, we enjoyed our stay, which I am sure was influenced by the fact that we left the two kids at home, and we decided that next time we would try the modern tower, maybe that would be a quieter experience.

Throughout our week there, they were, without exception, friendly, helpful and down to earth, calling us by name all week. I found myself tipping well and often. The hotel was built in 1926 by C.P Huntington, one of the &quot;Big 4&quot; railroad tycoons along with Hopkins, Stanford and Crocker. Having spent some of my career at Mr. Huntington's shipyard in Virginia, the choice was a natural for me. I was not disappointed. The hotel is historic, but updated in most respects. Smaller than the other Nob Hill hotels, the lobby is intimate and dining choices are limited to the &quot;Big Four&quot; Restaurant, highly rated by Zagat. Our dinner there was both very good and expensive...a &quot;special occasion&quot; venue unless on expense account. We also followed the doorman's recommendation of the Nob Hill Cafe, a quick 2 block (horizontal!) walk. Excellent choice with good food and reasonable prices. We booked one of the standard rooms through Expedia for $121 per night...a bargain by any standard. The King bed was comfortable and the room was immaculate. The bathroom looked newly renovated with wall to wall mirrors and a window that could be opened to let in the bay breezes. A caffeine addict, I was annoyed that there was no in-room coffee maker. Free coffee is available in the lobby only from 5-7 am...ok for the businessman, but not if you're on vacation. If you miss the deadline, it's $3 for an 8 oz paper cup in the restaurant. Internet access is $9.95 a day, ending at 1 pm. No free WiFi as I have become accustomed to. Another minor annoyance is the lack of ice machines. You have to call the bellman and have it delivered.. The minibar was empty, but I don't use those anyway...it was handy for storing leftovers. Another unexpected bonus...the Huntington has an agreement with Hertz rental car...your paperwork can be completed by the concierge and faxed to Hertz. And for an additional $20, you car will be waiting at the front door of the hotel and when returning, just hand the key to the doorman and walk in. Just make your reservation ahead of time to ensure there's a car available. Conveniently located on the cable car line ($5 per person), we found it more convenient to take a cab everywhere...$8 to Fisherman's Wharf and $10 to the Museum. The cabs are safe and the drivers the friendliest I have found.

I booked our stay through Expedia and chose Villa Florence for its location and its pet policy (no added fee!), since our Jack Russell terrier accompanied us on our trip. The hotel let us check into our room early (check-in is at 3 pm), even though I only called them 30 minutes before we arrived. They also honored my request for a quiet, pet-friendly room at the last minute when I wrongfully assumed that Expedia would pass on our special requests. We were warmly welcomed by the staff, and our anxious dog, who is not exactly a city dog and was overwhelmed with all the hustle and bustle, was met with smiles and welcome petting. (Every time we went in and out of the hotel, we, including our dog, were greeted warmly by the staff.) Our standard king room was not exactly gigantic, but large enough for us and was well-decorated and clean. The bathroom is small but quite functional and had great products from Lather. My husband was happy to see the large flat screen tv and the ipod ready sound system in the room. The linens on the bed were soft and the feather bed quite comfortable. The room itself was an interior room with no view, which was good for us since it got quite noisy at night from the busy streets below. On Friday night, we heard the faint thumping bass from a nearby club but not so loud that we couldn't sleep. We had breakfast at the attached restaurant, Kuleto's, on our final day, and it was reasonably priced (compared to everything else in San Francisco) and very tasty. The cable cars run right in front of the hotel on Powell Street and the Bart/Muni station is just 2 blocks down, so transportation was no problem at all. The only negative I would say about our stay was the lack of nearby parks to take our dog. Union Square, even with its grassy area, wasn't exactly an ideal place for our dog. Overall, I would recommend Villa Florence for its friendly service, clean and comfortable accomodations and its proximity to everything. We had a great time!

I had requested a room on the top floor, facing Jones street (as recommended by other TripAdvisor users!) I was pleased to see they had noted my requests and honored them. The room was a little small, but that didn't really bother us.. We didn't plan a trip to San Francisco to sit in our room!

It does not match the class of the hotel by any means, and it would not be hard for Marriott to get some more neutral shower curtains that are more pleasant to look at! The provided toiletries are Bath and Body works- they smell so wonderful and are a nice touch. Parking was once again steep, at $38 a night, but I was prepared for that. It was nice to be so close to the Wharf, where we specifically wanted to be because we were taking a night tour of Alcatraz. When that was finished, it was a quick walk back to the hotel.

The Ritz Carlton is a beautiful hotel! The lobby is gorgeous and the hallways are decorated with artwork from local artists that depict famous landmarks and scenes. After flying into San Fran from NYC it was late and all of the restaurants were closed luckily there is 24 hour room service! It is expensive. My husband and I ordered: (salty) chicken fingers and fries, cheeseburger/fries along with two sodas and it came to $60. I later read the fine print on the receipt and there is a $4 delivery charge so I think there is no need to tip? I did anyway. I also ordered room service the next day for breakfast which was a 3 egg omelet (cheese, spinach) along w/toast and a coffee that came to $40. After the first day no more room service, though I must say the breakfast was superb. The room was spacious and the sheets were phenomenal (400 thread count, make it hard to get out of bed). The Ritz also has different pillows to accommodate you (fluffy, soft, hard). The room had a 32' flat screen television with a wide selection of movies to order from. Wireless internet service is available. The room was also equipped with a Bose system that allowed you to plug in your ipod. Bulgari also provides all of your toiletries. I loved the turn down service! I would come back to my room exhausted and have chocolates on my bed, a copy of the latest headlines from the New York Times, and the local jazz station playing. It was so relaxing and thoughtful. The location is perfect and a 2 minute walking distance to Chinatown, Union Square (tons of shopping), bus stops, trolley stops,and Grace Cathedral.The entire staff was very knowledgeable. I needed walking directions to the murals on balmy avenue and there was a line at the concierge (also extremely helpful) so one of the bellhops just asked how can I help you? How awesome is that? He gave me directions and I was on my way. I wish I had gotten his name because he was very helpful. The cleaning staff was awesome, I think my cleaning ladies name was Yalitza? she was phenomenal.The only problem I had with my room (#360) was that it is what I would consider the bottom floor. In order to access the room you have to take the elevator one floor down to the 3rd floor (which I think is the conference room floor), then walk down some stairs to access my room. It was directly across from the kitchen? and above the beautiful courtyard. Besides the steps which is not recommended for disabled visitors, it was loud on the last 2 days of my stay. There might have been a wedding or some function that lasted what seemed like 3 in the morning. I also think hotel guests would go there to have a smoke or drink with friends which equals loud noise. To be honest I expect to have a great room at the Ritz especially for someone who pays $500 a night. I was a tad bit disappointed in the room. I am sure I could have switched rooms but it was late and I did not expect to hear noise two nights in a row. I have visited the Ritz Carlton in New Orleans and they are all beautiful hotels with attentive staff. All in all I enjoyed my stay at the Ritz Carlton and I would visit again.I hope this review helps someone.

I'll start with the good points.As far as location, it's in a really nice part of the city and we didn't feel uncomfortable touring the neighbourhood in the evening. Upon arriving, the doormen and bellman were very courteous and quick to get you in and settled. The lobby is very elegant and has an old time charm to it. I've read in other reviews that the staff can be rude and a little on the snobby side but that wasn't our experience. However, some of the guests we had interacted with obviously left their manners at home while on vacation! As far the as the room (we stayed in a deluxe) there wasn't anything all tha deluxe about it. I guess they called it deluxe because of the view which wasn' too bad when the fog wasn't in. However, they don't go all out for you when you book online using because you're getting a better deal. The rooms were clean, and the bathroom was a decent size. If you plan on ordering room service then expect to pay the price.

The only really &quot;bad&quot; thing I have to say is that if you're walking back to the hotel be prepared to get quie the workout. If you're not able to wait around for a cable car or absolutely have to walk it's not for those who are in good health or have mobility issues.

What attracted us to this hotel was the price and location. The daily AAA rate was $151/night after taxes (~$110 before taxes). This special rate did not allow us to upgrade to include continental breakfast for an additional $1.00. A few days after our stay, Travelzoo published a special rate for the hotel: $89/night.The boutique hotel was elegant and more personal than the Hilton. The staff was very friendly. We were in room 416 despite requesting a room that was higher up. We didn't pay extra for a view , so we were stuck looking at what seemed to be a rooftop with some pipes and electrical units. The room was strikingly small -- more bed than walkable floor space. This did not bother us though since we were looking for an inexpensive, clean place to rest our heads. The tv was oddly off-center to the bed which made for an awkward viewing angle. The room was very nice and clean overall. The bathroom was spacious and stocked with Aveda products. We were amused that the bathroom seemed handicapped-friendly: raised toilet seat, handbars in bathtub, non-slip mat for bathtub. Our first gripe came at 6:30 AM when we were awakened by loud thumping sounds. Being city folk, we have a high tolerance for next-door-neighbor noise. However when the noise continued for 1.5 hrs, we realized that the noise was something else other than neighbors rustling around.

We were able to get an excellent senior rate of $139 per night for a room with king bed, and we were very satisfied. The room was fairly large (15' X 15&quot;) with high ceilings, and a large flat screen TV. We were aware of the excessive cost of certain items (internet and parking), and worked around them. Since San Francisco was our final stop on the trip, we turned in our rental car when we arrived at the hotel.

There is also a BART station in front of the hotel.We always request a quiet room location, and on this stay we were given an inside room.

I'm actually writing this from the hotel, where I'm attending a conference. For $250/night, I would expect a room with a coffeemaker at the least, and enough space to move around without bumping into things. Although the closet is huge, the bathroom is very tiny with literally no counter space. The bedroom is like an obstacle course, with the TV positioned to the side of the bed, forcing you to view it by craning your neck to the left. The only window in the room looks across at an inner courtyard of the hotel where the ventilation system is located (i.e., not in the least bit scenic, and the drapes have to be kept closed most of the time since it faces other rooms.) The woman at the front desk during check-in asked whether I preferred a high or low floor and then put me on the second floor. I also asked to be located away from the elevator so she put me directly across from one. (All I can figure is that she was having a very bad day, but she made a horrible first impression for the hotel. She wasn't in the least bit pleasant.) The toiletries in the bathroom were good quality but It seemed that toilet paper was being rationed as I had to ask for an extra roll. I also didn't receive my copy of the Sunday Times on Sunday. Normally this kind of stuff would be overlooked by me, but it all started adding up to a not entirely pleasant stay. The bed comfort was acceptable but not the best.The hotel is within walking distance to Union Square, but keep in mind that it's uphill the whole way back if you walk. The prices in the hotel (from the mini-bar to room service to the restaurants) are all high, so it's worthwhile to check out the groceries and cafes nearby.Since I'm a President's Club member, the fitness center and internet were free of charge, so those were positives. The hotel is very ornate and interesting from a historical perspective and everything is well kept. From what I've heard, I'd ask for a room in the tower vs. in the main building where I stayed.

I got a good rate of $99 per night before tax which is a fantastic rate for a hotel of this standard and in such a good location, I have stayed at Radisson chains before and this was one if not the best one so far.I had room 4051 on the 4th floor with a King sleepnumber bed which was very comfortable indeed,made everyday and had at least 6 very cofmortable pillows and a nice cover. The room was nice and spacious and very quiet at night with no noise coming from the front or any other guests for that matter. Nice sized television with all the channels you needed and complimentary Wi-Fi broadband available in the room which i used with my laptop on the in room desk area.The bathroom was very clean and spacious with a good sized bath/shower and plenty of fresh towels and toiletries left daily which was a nice welcome.The hotel is ajoined to Johnny Rockets which is handy and the pool is great,I never got to try the gymn area but saw it and it looked pretty cool. Has a nice seating area outside too as I enjoyed the warm weather there with a cool drink on occassions and lots of seating area in the lobby to relax with a drink and a newspaper.The location is such that you do not need to use public transport, From here I walked everywhere including to Chinatown,North Beach,Lombard street/Nob hill and all of the front and on one hot day I walked from the hotel to the Golden gate bridge along the costal pathway/Chrissy fields which was all within walking distance if you dont mind walking.Theres a great place next door that offers a full american breakfast for $6.99 which is next to the seven eleven which had some good value food and a I-hop to the other side and then you have all the regular food places withina 2 min walk as well burger king/mcdonalds etc.I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone and would stay here again if I found myself in town,The area is very safe and I walked it at all hours even to 1.30am in the morning alone and had no problems at all just the usual homeless situation that all parts of america have but they wont bother you so dont let that put you off.I have lots of pics too which I will attach shortly as I am at work at the moment,Feel free to contact me with any questions.Things I would recommend:-Use Supershuttle from SFO they offer a $15 door to door service which is very handy although the BART is not hard to navigate the shuttle is nice to just sit back and relax after a long flight.-Try the Clam Chowder and Sourdough across the road from the hotels back entrance its great-And finally definately see the city by foot (or bike) you see so much more than in a car or on public transport and get the real experience.

I DID get a Hilton employee discount, but being that this was San Francisco, it was still steep.I contacted someone at the hotel a week prior to arrival asking for an upgrade as a bit of professional courtesy. As a Hilton employee, I am accustomed to receiving these requests and always try to oblige. I was told &quot;I will see what I can do.&quot; No further response from her and I assumed incorrectly that she has made this possible for us. Upon arrival, I informed the front desk agent (Carlos) of my correspondence with this employee and he was quick to say that there was nothing in the records and there was nothing he could do for me. Cold demeanor, no effort to remedy the situation. I then told him that I did not want to be charged the $50 per day incidental charge and to turn off my incidentals in the room as I would not be using them (ie.pay per view movies etc.) He then proceeded to charge me for them on top of the full amount for my week and then informed me that my card had been declined. When I asked why, he claimed that he had no idea (even though he did, as i know what he is looking at on his screen) and yet no apology. He corrected it and the card went thru. The next day I emailed the General Manager and voiced my disappointment. NO response. I guess the hotel that i work for is just a whole lot friendlier as we roll out the red carpet when a Hilton employee books at our hotel. It takes so little effort. I was not looking for a free ride, but simply an upgrade to my expensive stay. My advice: If you are a Hilton employee, DO NOT expect the special treatment at this hotel. They are not interested in building that kind of relationship. The General Manager at my property would most certainly handled this personally.

The biggest difference between these hotels is that the Parc 55 really doesn't seem to value customer service. There was a convention going on during my stay, but from what the staff said there is usually a convention going on. This might have had an effect on my service, but if conventions are a regular event, then I doubt the service improves much from week to week.The good: I got a Club room on the 29th floor and the room and view were beautiful.

I've rarely seen a hotel in the United States offer a single room, and I applaud them for offering solo travelers an opportunity to pay only for space they're using rather than forcing them to pay for two. Some may say this room is very small, but if you're used to staying in single rooms around Europe, you'll find this room very nicely sized with a good shower large enough to turn around in. Everything in the room was new, fresh and clean. I felt like I was the first person using it all. It was very comfortable with good heating and hot water. The bathroom had a nice line of complimentary toiletries. The room had a flat screen television of a good size and a quality clock radio. There was a basket of snacks for purchase on the desk, and unlike most mini-bar arrangements, prices were reasonable.The included breakfast was set up in a small room two doors down from me. It was a self serve arrangement of packaged croissants, muffins etc. There was decent coffee and juices as well as a basket of oranges and sometimes apples. USA Today was available in the lobby for free. While the breakfast was nothing exciting, I wasn't expecting any breakfast at all to be included, so it was a nice convenience and money saver. I found the best way to take it was to put on my robe and go to the breakfast room and fill a plate and coffee and juice cups and take it back to my room and eat comfortably. I got some strange looks from other guests, but it didn't look like such a great idea to stand around in the small crowded room or hallway having breakfast.The location of the hotel was superb. It was very close to Union Square, the theatres, shops and many nice restaurants. If you take the BART in from the airport, the hotel is very close to the station.The staff at the hotel were very nice and helpful.

Expedia refused to give me the new lower rate making it necessary for me to cancel and rebook incurring an unfair cancellation penalty of $25 as well as voiding a $50 discount Expedia coupon I applied to the stay - a loss of $75.In the future I would book directly with the hotel.

The hotel is old but has character. The location is good, right on Van Ness and Geary. The lobby is nice. The room was small but had everything one might need. The bed was not super comfortable and the pillows were not great. We could not figure out why, but there was a very strong and pervasive smell of cigarette smoke coming from the bathroom. The floor was non-smoking and when I inquired about the problem at the front desk, she said the hotel was non-smoking. It was a very bad smell and quite annoying for two non-smokers. We did not try the breakfast (woke up too late) but ate at Mel's Diner, which is connected to the hotel. Pretty convenient. Parking is $25 per night and the garage is connected to the hotel. Also convenient and relatively affordable, as many hotels in SF charge upward of $40 per night for parking.

This was one of the more affordable places to get a room with two beds on race weekend. We checked in at about 5pm on Saturday and were even offered an upgrade!

Our room was really nice and modern, everything was extremely clean as well. The beds were ridiculously comfortable and the shower with the two shower heads was awesome. I thought the room was HUGE for being in the city. I may be used to smaller rooms because I usually stay at older historic hotels but I'd say this was comparable to a standard mgm property room in Vegas. The room had 2 double beds, a desk with a chair, a comfy chair &amp; a dresser with a flat panel tv and still a good amount of open space.  My only complaint is that parking was $50 a night, but it is always pretty pricey to park in SF so whatever. We only stayed one night and we're pretty easy so our interaction with the staff other than check-in was minimal but the room and hotel worked out perfectly for what we needed it for.

The rooms are in excellent condition, and the maid service is first class. The staff are very helpul and courteous at all times, ensuring our stay went without a hitch.

After walking around San Francisco for 3 days I didn't find another hotel or location I preferred over the Orchard Garden Hotel. It just has that perfect balance of everything: nice clean tasteful boutique hotel that isn't too big nor too small, fantastic location that's close to transit (walkable from BART which was a huge plus for getting from and to the airport) and restaurants/cafes/bars that's not in an overly busy noisy area. I wouldn't have wanted to stay at any of the hotels within a block or 2 of Union Square. The only kind of traveler it wouldn't suit would be the kind that could only feel comfortable in a large chain hotel. One of the things we really appreciated was the free Wi-fi at our rooms. I think an earlier reviewer of this hotel suggested booking directly with the hotel to get better rooms. I think that reviewer may be correct. We booked about 2 1/2 months in advance through Expedia and we got the smallest room at possibly the worst location and we didn't pay any less than others. We checked in mid-afternoon so it wasn't like we got the last room available. Still, the room wasn't too small and we were happy because it was very clean and well-appointed. The bathroom was quite large with nice bath products. We were right beside the housekeeping room (anyone accessing the housekeeping room could be heard) and we had no view with little natural light but even still, it wasn't too bad at all - we didn't spend that much time in the room!As for the staff, they were great anytime we needed them. One night time concierge recommended a fantastic restaurant to us that was closeby: E &amp; O Trading Company. It was so good we went there twice! I recommend the lamb, the satay appetizer plate and the Russian River Pinot Noir! Reservations are recommended at least a few hours in advance if going on the weekend. Speaking of restaurants, we also ate at Trademark that was located on a lane way that was just north of Bush and west of Kearney (or was it east of Kearney?). That laneway had about 5 restaurants all in a row and it gets top marks for atmosphere. It reminded me of some dining experiences in France. Go there for pretty good food and fabulous atmosphere but then also go to E &amp; O for super tasty food. Another eatery that was good was across the street called Cafe de la Presse. It's good for brunch. For brunch, one of the daytime concierges recommended Sears and also a diner that started with &quot;L&quot; I can't remember but we went there and they were just touristy 50's American style diners which didn't suit us but I'm sure many people would like that type of place. A friend who lives outside San Francisco took us to the top of Macy's where The Cheesecake Company is located. It's a super busy restaurant with a vast menu. Even though it's in Macy's, it's open until late, accessible by a private elevator. We only had dessert there - cheesecake - so I can't comment on the food but the portions were large and it draws such a huge crowd it must be pretty good or it could be just another tourist attraction? The night time view off the terrace was the best part and I recommend it for the view.One tip if taking the Powell-Hyde cable car or any cable car for that matter. Don't try to get on at the first or last stop as there will be too many people queuing to hop on. You could wait over 40 minutes to get on as the conductor won't let too many people get on at once. Walk to the next stop where there will be much fewer people waiting. You'll get on right away! We were waiting at Powell and Market to get on where there were over 100 people forming a queue and we were told the wait would be about 45 minutes to get on. I discreetly asked the conductor if I could just walk to the next stop and he discreetly said yes. We did and got on right away!Oh another nice thing about the hotel...we left our luggage there after check out for an hour and when we retrieved our bags the doorman/porter told us the maid noticed I left my ipod on the dock in the room! I really appreciated their honesty. My husband would have been pretty upset with me if I had lost it!Anyway, my husband and I had a really great time in San Francisco (first visit for both of us). It's such a pretty city and even with the many tourists it attracts, it didn't feel too crowded or too busy. The Orchard Garden Hotel definitely added to our stay - who wants a bad hotel at a bad location? Go book it. You won't regret it!

I would complain about the size of the bedroom except that I visited a different room that a collegue was staying in and in comparison to his my room was downright spacious.They have free internet access, which is wonderful. However, despite supposedly being high speed, the speed I got was far closer to dial up. The TV was good however. They actually had quite a few channels.This has been a somewhat rambling review. The bottom line is that at the regular price, this is not the hotel for you. The rooms are clean but small and the location is on the edge of a very bad section of town. If you somehow get a bargain discount, it might be worth it. Just go into it with an open eye. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1465, 1479)",1,0.0,False

Since I used to live in SF and travel their quite frequently for work, I am quite familiar with the city and knew we would want to stay in union square (as my boyfriend has never been there and this is the best &quot;touristy&quot; spot). I usually prefer to stay at the Sir Francis Drake or the Westin St. Francis but both were overbooked. I was left with the Clift and Hotel Nikko. I definiately made the wrong choice even though I had heard good things about the lounge and restaurant. Since I have stayed at the Morgan (NYC) several times I assumed we would have a pleasant experience and I LOVE Asia de Cuba in NYC. I was wrong!  When we arrived at the Clift, the doorman did not even open the door or even aknowledge our pressence. Check-in was smooth but the girl was certainly rushing us and annoyed with any questions. Our original plan was to spend our first night with dinner at Asia De Cuba and start off with some early evening cocktails at the Redwood Room. BIG MISTAKE. Upon check-in we asked if we needed reservations for the Redwood Room. The girl gave us some &quot;preferred customer&quot; cards of some sort which she explained would get us right in with no problem. We approached the hostess at about 730 pm. There were a couple of guys in front of us whom the hostess was assisting. As we patiently waited, a large group came up behind us. The matron of the group approached the hostess - cutting in front of everyone else AND interrupting the conversation between the hostess and the 2 guys. Rather than telling this RUDE woman to go stand in line actually assisted her! The guys in front of us looked apalled and we were infuriated. Once it was finally our turn (like that mattered to the hostess) she very rudely told us we couldnt come in without a reservation. She said she had people arriving at 9 pm. We explained we just wanted ONE pre-dinner cocktail. At this point she got even more rude. At this point we decided this was NOT a place we wanted to spend out money anyways. They obviously dont care about their actual guests! The scene was horrible anyways. I dont think there was a patron under the age of 65 in the entire bar.... so much for a &quot;hip&quot; bar scene. We tried to complain to a manager but he was too busy having a personal conversation with one of the doormen. We decided our money is better spent elsewhere and opted against dinner in the hotel. We had a lovely meal in the Marina district then went on to drinks at Matrix where our patronage was appreciated and our drinks were not accompanied with a side of rudeness. I might also point out the martinis are $8 at Matrix as opposed to the overpriced drinks Redwood Room with serve you along with their snooty attitude. We are from LA so we are no strangers to attitude but this was just plain RUDE.  Aside from the horrible experience our first night, the hotel lobby is quite nice. The rooms are VERY small and somewhat dirty. The bathroom is appalling - dirty towels, the fan doesnt work, no standing room. On our final day, the anger from night one had worn off slightly (probably because we spent as little time in the hotel as possible). We were packing our stuff and relaxing from a morning of shopping. The day before, housekeeping entered our room even though we had the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign on the door. Since nothing was taken we ignored it. Now here we are, a mere hour from escaping the Clift, when there is a knock at the door...housekeeping. I explain we are leaving at 1 (check out time) and to please respect the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign. 15 minutes later, another knock at the door. It is the housekeeper AGAIN. I tell her &quot;we are still here&quot; and remind her of our departure time. Sure enough, another knock at the door and who could it be? The SAME housekeeper. At this point we are so frustrated my boyfriend tells her to wait outside and we gather all our stuff (half packed and all). They clearly wanted us gone so we sprinted to the elevator checked out and left the Clift behind.  Trust me, the Clift offers NOTHING to validate such horrible attitudes and behavior. I had high hopes for this place and if they had impressed me, I would have considered staying there on my monthly business trips up to SF. Forget it. I will definately tell everyone I know NOT to stay here and I will probably never stay at the Morgan again either just because of the Clift affiliation. Trust me, you are better off at the Sir Francis Drake or the Westin. At least they know you exist there and are gracious for your patronage.

The room was wonderful and quiet even though we had a room overlooking a street and a parking lot. The location is great being near the Wharf, plus near the cable cars and several buses. The biggest downside was the breakfast bar was packed to capacity every morning, probably because there were 170 kids in two groups on Spring Break trips. That meant we had often had to watch like hawks to get a table and many people didn't have a clue about how to clean up after themselves. However, the breakfasts were great with doughnuts, hard-boiled eggs, fresh fruit, hot cinnamon buns, cereal, and toast/English muffins. There also isn't a laundry facility onsite so we had to go next door to the Holiday Inn (not HI Express).

Pool/spa area on 4th floor looked nice though we only walked through to take a peek.

However, there is a Starbucks downstairs and a couple of places the next block down that had even better coffe and a great selection of doughnuts.

The room downgrade was not explained to me, nor was any adjustment to my room rate offered. Breakfast in the restaurant was underwhelming and overpriced. I have a pet peeve about arriving in a nearly empty restaurant alone and being seated in the worst possible spot. I had my newspaper and was dressed in business casual attire. For some unknown reason, I was seated in the darkest corner near the kitchen. This type of thing often happens in hotel restaurants. Presumably the idea is to fill up the bad seats in case some VIP comes along. I cannot stress what a bad impression this sort of treatment leaves in a guest's mind. From this point forward, I look for the negative, not the positive because I don't want to like the place. Advice to Restaurant management. Don't do this if you don't want to get slammed in reviews by travelers like me.I have read numerous positive reviews of this hotel on both this and other websites. I am sure they have some nice rooms and that some people enjoy good service. I was not so lucky. I am not a complainer, and perhaps that is what it takes to squeeze good service out of this hotel's personnel. I am not willing to spend a lot of time fighting. But even though I didn't demand better treatment this time, I demand better treatment from hotels I patronize, and therefore I will never return or recommend this place.

The property was clean, the room smelled nice, the toiletries were nice, the beds very comfortable (if you like a firm bed, which I do). Furnishings are IKEA-like, but that gave the room a clean, spacious, modern feel. Shutters on the windows a nice touch. Fascinating toilet ... a wee faucet turns on automatically for you to wash your hands afterwards, and your soapy water runs into the tank for the next flush. I have the feeling that this innovation is going to be the norm in another few years, but this was the first time I'd seen it! Can imagine it would be a great incentive for children to wash their hands.The location would be convenient - near BART, City Hall, the Asian Art Museum, all the streetcars on Market St., easy walking distance to the cable car turnaround - if the city would do something about the homeless population. I was mortified to walk around with my Australian friend, who had never seen anything like it. I hated to have her see America as a place where all these poor souls who clearly need to be in hospitals or institutions have fallen thru the cracks of our frayed social safety net and are living on the streets. Oh, well, I guess truth hurts. The unintelligible shouting beneath our windows kept us awake, the stench of urine in the exterior corners of most buildings made walking to the streetcar a punishment, and the constant sense of menace from filthy people who were obviously not in their right minds was most uncomfortable.I do not recommend this hotel to anyone traveling alone, particularly females.

The street noise was pretty bad and we were woken up a few times because of this. There were a few homeless people who would sit on the street outside and make a ton of noise throughout the night. Also, the restaurant drags their tables and chairs inside at midnight or later and then outside at 7:00am.

During the day I enjoyed walking around to see the sites, shop and experience some of the local eateries and pubs. I loved the Adagio's Tapas restaurant and bar in the evenings. Sat at the bar.

The mattress was old and lumpy. The room was by the elevator and noisy day and night. Housekeeping didn't show up until 3:30 or 4 on both days of my stay. She didn't empty the garbage even. There was no bell service either coming or going. My view was of fire escapes of some downtrodden multifamily dwelling. The room downgrade was not explained to me, nor was any adjustment to my room rate offered. Breakfast in the restaurant was underwhelming and overpriced. I have a pet peeve about arriving in a nearly empty restaurant alone and being seated in the worst possible spot. I had my newspaper and was dressed in business casual attire. For some unknown reason, I was seated in the darkest corner near the kitchen. This type of thing often happens in hotel restaurants. Presumably the idea is to fill up the bad seats in case some VIP comes along. I cannot stress what a bad impression this sort of treatment leaves in a guest's mind.

Having spent some of my career at Mr. Huntington's shipyard in Virginia, the choice was a natural for me. I was not disappointed. The hotel is historic, but updated in most respects.

The bathroom looked newly renovated with wall to wall mirrors and a window that could be opened to let in the bay breezes. A caffeine addict, I was annoyed that there was no in-room coffee maker. Free coffee is available in the lobby only from 5-7 am...ok for the businessman, but not if you're on vacation. If you miss the deadline, it's $3 for an 8 oz paper cup in the restaurant. Internet access is $9.95 a day, ending at 1 pm. No free WiFi as I have become accustomed to. Another minor annoyance is the lack of ice machines. You have to call the bellman and have it delivered.. The minibar was empty, but I don't use those anyway...it was handy for storing leftovers. Another unexpected bonus...the Huntington has an agreement with Hertz rental car...your paperwork can be completed by the concierge and faxed to Hertz. And for an additional $20, you car will be waiting at the front door of the hotel and when returning, just hand the key to the doorman and walk in. Just make your reservation ahead of time to ensure there's a car available. Conveniently located on the cable car line ($5 per person), we found it more convenient to take a cab everywhere...$8 to Fisherman's Wharf and $10 to the Museum. The cabs are safe and the drivers the friendliest I have found. All in all, we were very pleased with our stay and left feeling like friends rather than customers...everyone was so helpful from the front desk to the doorman to the housekeeper.

The decor of the hotel was charming - old fashioned and elegant but with all the modern necessities. It felt like we were staying in a friend's home instead of in a hotel. To my knowledge there is no air conditioning however it's likely not needed there most of the year. We simply opened the windows when needed to let in the wonderful bay breeze (the weather was in the mid to upper 70's, quite unusual we were told for that time of year - and much appreciated!!). We reserved the hotel's town car one weekday morning to go to Union Square along with another guest which was a fantastic service. The breakfast buffet was delicious (hard-boiled eggs, oatmeal, bagels, breads, croissants, fruit, meat and cheeses) and our coffee was refilled at our table each morning. We also loved the 24/7 coffee, tea and water available near the lobby , especially after a long day of sightseeing! We were able to order food delivered from &quot;Waiters on Wheels&quot; which was very convenient when we wanted to relax in our room (though our choice was an unfortunate one -Gino's Pizza was the worst I've ever had).

Market is a busy street so the rooms on this side will be noisy. The McAllister side entry of the hotel has a handful of homeless/shady people constantly loitering close by and the street itself always smells like urine.When I checked in, the hotel staff were friendly and helpful. They tried hard to accommodate their guests. I have only nice things to say about the people who work here. The hotel itself, on the other hand, is far from reproach. While the lobby area looks decent, the rooms and hallways are old and sorta dirty. They really need to change the carpet.Let's start with the problems for the rooms, in order of worst to least annoyance:1) LOUD and CONSTANT knocking sound from the radiator. It sounds like you're sleeping in a construction zone with someone banging against metal pipes with a hammer. I called the front desk to report the problem twice and was told that there's nothing they could do about the radiator noise on the 2nd floor. However, they were able to move me to the 7th floor where the noise level was extant, but much more bearable. The hotel does not turn on the heat until 8 PM and turns it off at 7AM. Their 100 years old heating system needs to be upgraded to 21st century machines.2) Non-working wireless internet. Although I read online that this hotel does not have wireless, they did. I was able to connect to the hotel wireless but could not get internet. Several calls to the front desk produced no result so they gave me an 866 (supposed to be toll-free and free of charge, see complaint #3) number to reach the internet provider directly. I sat on the phone with the support desk staff for 20 minutes while he walked me through every step to troubleshoot the problem. It was then determined that the problem lies in the routers of the hotel, not the user, and that internet will not be available for an indefinite amount of time. Basically, the hotel had no free internet access for guests.3) Phone charge. When I received the 1-866-xxx-xxxx number to contact the front desk, I specifically asked whether they will charge me to make this call. Their answer was no. When I checked out of the hotel, they charged me $1 for connection fee because I made a call using their phone. I argued for a little but decided to just give them a buck instead of wasting my time. This was a completely unfair charge considering that I was double-deceived and still unable to resolve the internet problem. I should not be charge to contact their own vendor to rectify an issue for which Renoir Hotel should be responsible.4) Baby towels. The hotel's bath towels are rough and is about the size of a small wash cloth or half the width of a regular towel.5) Hard, lumpy bed. Yes, the bed seemed clean but it was hard and lumpy.6) 13&quot; color TV with cable but a dead remote7) There is no air conditioning, just a fan. I don't think A/C is really necessary in SF because you could just open the window to get some cool air. But would I want the urine smell on McAllister street to get into my room?Overall, I think the issue lies in the hotel owner and their management issues, not of their staff. I will not stay at this hotel again and I do not recommend others to book your stay here unless you are limited in choice (Priceline, cost, or whatever).

Throughout our week there, they were, without exception, friendly, helpful and down to earth, calling us by name all week. I found myself tipping well and often. The hotel was built in 1926 by C.P Huntington, one of the &quot;Big 4&quot; railroad tycoons along with Hopkins, Stanford and Crocker. Having spent some of my career at Mr. Huntington's shipyard in Virginia, the choice was a natural for me. I was not disappointed. The hotel is historic, but updated in most respects. Smaller than the other Nob Hill hotels, the lobby is intimate and dining choices are limited to the &quot;Big Four&quot; Restaurant, highly rated by Zagat. Our dinner there was both very good and expensive...a &quot;special occasion&quot; venue unless on expense account. We also followed the doorman's recommendation of the Nob Hill Cafe, a quick 2 block (horizontal!) walk. Excellent choice with good food and reasonable prices. We booked one of the standard rooms through Expedia for $121 per night...a bargain by any standard. The King bed was comfortable and the room was immaculate. The bathroom looked newly renovated with wall to wall mirrors and a window that could be opened to let in the bay breezes. A caffeine addict, I was annoyed that there was no in-room coffee maker. Free coffee is available in the lobby only from 5-7 am...ok for the businessman, but not if you're on vacation. If you miss the deadline, it's $3 for an 8 oz paper cup in the restaurant. Internet access is $9.95 a day, ending at 1 pm. No free WiFi as I have become accustomed to. Another minor annoyance is the lack of ice machines. You have to call the bellman and have it delivered.. The minibar was empty, but I don't use those anyway...it was handy for storing leftovers. Another unexpected bonus...the Huntington has an agreement with Hertz rental car...your paperwork can be completed by the concierge and faxed to Hertz. And for an additional $20, you car will be waiting at the front door of the hotel and when returning, just hand the key to the doorman and walk in. Just make your reservation ahead of time to ensure there's a car available. Conveniently located on the cable car line ($5 per person), we found it more convenient to take a cab everywhere...$8 to Fisherman's Wharf and $10 to the Museum. The cabs are safe and the drivers the friendliest I have found. All in all, we were very pleased with our stay and left feeling like friends rather than customers...everyone was so helpful from the front desk to the doorman to the housekeeper.

The website made it look great and the reviews I had read were very positive. However, despite the reasonable room rates (I paid 179/night), this is just not a hotel I would return to.GENERAL: The problem with Kimpton hotels, in my opinion, is that they are theme hotels rather than true luxury hotels. The theme of the Palomar is &quot;fancy hotel&quot;. It emulates luxury, but doesn't actually achieve it.LOCATION: The hotel is located very centrally on the corner of Market Street and 4th St. The particular street corner is ridden with somewhat sleazy types, and the building abuts an Old Navy store.LOBBY: I generally enjoy large, open spaces, and the lobby, though well-appointed, was the opposite.ROOMS: TINY!!!!! The very friendly receptionist had even upgraded me to one of the larger rooms, and that was still an extremely small room. The room was nicely appointed but, again, TINY!! The bathroom was so tiny that, sitting on the toilet, my knees nearly touched the cheaply painted-over sliding door that separates the bedroom from the bathroom. The bedding was awful. The pillows were tiny and not firm enough.SERVICE: This is the hotel's one big plus. Everyone from the receptionist to Virgil, the very friendly and knowledgeable concierge, to the bellboys, were professional and courteous.RESTAURANT: The restaurant, Fifth Floor, has received rave reviews on Zagat and elsewhere. It bills itself as a gourmet fine dining restaurant with a star chef. I have eaten in some of the finest restaurants domestically and internationally, and this restaurant just wasn't that great. The service was terrific, but the food, though flavorful and inventive, wasn't worth the $173 price tag (for one person!!). Entrees priced between 40-52 dollars!!!SUMMARY: If you are in dire need of a boutique hotel in San Francisco, go to the W. It's near the Palomar, but it is a first-rate version of itself rather than a second-rate version of another hotel (which is what, sadly, most of the Kimpton hotels are).

It was our first time staying at the Hotel Palomar or at any Kimpton Hotel. We decided on this hotel because it was pet friendly and we had our two dogs with us for the weekend. We booked our room through the hotel's reservations directly because they were able to give us a better deal than all the other travel websites. Would highly recommend that you contact the hotel and see what their best available prices are before you book your rooms via Expedia or Orbitz, etc. The minute we pulled up to the front, we were instantly greeted and helped out. They also greeted our puppies which made us felt very welcomed. When we were checking in, the people at the front desk even gave our pups doggie treats. We had heard great things of a Thai restaurant but we couldn't remember the name exactly so we asked the gentlemen that was helping us with the check-in. He instantly looked up the name of the restaurant for us, and even helped us make reservations for the night! The location of the hotel makes going everywhere super convenient too....it's right in the heart of downtown, Union Square. We had a car with us so we had it valeted for the weekend. The hotel parks the car in their indoor parking lot located downstairs of the hotel, which is great because we didn't have to worry about the car being in an outdoor lot. Oh, and did I mention the complimentary wine hour!?!! The hotel hosts a complimentary wine hour where they introduce a red wine and white wine for their guests to try! Our overall experience was just absolutely awesome. The hotel is super accommodating, the staff were all very professional, and friendly. LOVED IT! Highly recommend it, hands down.

The staff is very professional and usually friendly and helpful. The layout of the hotel is a little strange and it was undergoing extensive renovations, so I'm not sure we saw it all. The lobby (not check-in) seems out of the way, so you never think of enjoying it. Not really sure what was there--the hotel didn't seem to have a lounge or bar. It did have a restaurant, but again it was out-of-the-way so you don't think about patronizing it. I never even saw it, so I can't comment on it.The concierge here is very helpful always ready with dinner recommendations, help with reservations, and even arranged for our rental car to be returned for us.Our room was on the fifth floor with city views. It was beautifully decorated and newly refurbished. The beds were extremely comfortable and triple-sheeted. There was a nice, large flat screen television. The room was very quiet, except during the day when there was the noise of construction. It wasn't horrible, but could be heard. It was also very clean. There were nice robes for after showering.On the downside: the room was quite small. One of our double beds was pushed up against the wall, so whoever slept there (me!) had to crawl over the other person. The bathroom was also quite small, especially the vanity area. The toilet and shower were separate from the vanity, which was nice. The room did not have a mini-bar or a dresser. Since the room was small, we had suitcases every where.Our boys had room service several times as my husband were going out for dinner. The service was quick (20 minutes or so) and the food was very good and excellently transported. For example, the milks and ice cream were kept on ice to keep them cold. The staff was friendly. Of course, it was very expensive. We paid about $40 dollars every night for a small pepperoni pizza, pb&amp;J, 2 milks, and two cookies by the time we paid the already high-cost of the food, delivery fee, and gratuity. Food in San Francisco is very expensive in general, and the convenience was nice and allowed my husband and me to get ready for a night out and gave our kids a treat of room service in front of the TV.The hotel is located at the top of Nob Hill and at the intersection of two cable car lines. It is only three blocks from China Town and close to a nice shopping district. There are some beautiful views. Walking in San Francisco and especially this area is quite a workout! The hills are very steep and it is straight up hill to the Stanford Court from every direction! As I said, two cable car lines stop in front of the hotel, which is nice, but they can be extremely crowded and you may need to be aggressive if you have stood at the cable car stop for awhile only to be pushed out of the way by others running for the car as it stops.This was a nice hotel, located in a pretty and historical area. Nob Hill was the center of old San Francisco wealth in the early 20th century. It is close to some interesting sites (but not Fisherman's Wharf although the cable cars take you directly there.)

Just make sure you don't have too much luggage. The hotel is also within walking distance of Union Square and Chinatown. There are also Muni lines and cable car lines very close by.HOTEL:I knew that it was an older hotel, but I guess I expected the rooms to be nicer. It is very clean, but there was no &quot;wow&quot; factor that I have seen at other hotels like Novotel Singapore or Venetian in Vegas. It was a regular room with regular t.v. with nice amenities but nothing ultra-modern. The bed was very comfortable. The rooms were very quiet, although you could hear some hallway noise, but nothing from outside the building. I guess that is why they are not considered a 5 star hotel. Minus one star for the room.SERVICE:The service was very good overall. Check in was quick and all the staff were extremely friendly. We are a select guest, so we get morning beverage service (you are supposed to get a card outside your room and you hang it out with your beverages). Since this is our first stay, we had no idea how this worked. We never got a card and got no beverages in the morning. When I called the front desk, they forwarded me to room service, and I got my beverages. I also told front desk that I didn't get a beverage card, just a room service, when they asked if I hung it outside. Well, for a #1 rated Tripadvisor and 4 star hotel, I would expect a select guest beverage card the following night, but no. So, minus one star for that. However, when I wanted coffee the next morning at 11:00 a.m. (they have a pot of coffee in Bob's every morning until 10:00 a.m.), the staff got me one, so add one star.Overall, this is a great hotel with great service. I can see why it is not 5 stars, but the service really makes it above the rest.HOTEL TIPS:Get free water and fruit in the fitness room. There is also free fruit in the afternoon and free lemonade in the lobby. There is free coffee in the morning at Bob's bar until 10:00 a.m. But, you get free beverage service delivered to your room if you sign up as a selected guest.RESTAURANT TIPS:We found two great restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. Both are highly rated on yelp. The first is Bix. It is on Gold St., which is about 5 blocks north of Montgomery (10 minutes walk). It's in a small alley, and the food is awesome and moderately priced (entrees $25 to 35 range). Their appetizers are incredible, and the atmosphere is very nice. The second is Great Eastern in Chinatown for dim sum. This place is located on Jackson St. by Kearny. It is very clean compared to the other Chinatown places, and you order off of a menu with pictures (no carts). Service is a bit slow, but if you are looking for an adventure in Chinatown, definitely try dim sum there. Go early (before 11:00) to avoid the crazy crowds!

Since I used to live in SF and travel their quite frequently for work, I am quite familiar with the city and knew we would want to stay in union square (as my boyfriend has never been there and this is the best &quot;touristy&quot; spot). I usually prefer to stay at the Sir Francis Drake or the Westin St. Francis but both were overbooked. I was left with the Clift and Hotel Nikko. I definiately made the wrong choice even though I had heard good things about the lounge and restaurant. Since I have stayed at the Morgan (NYC) several times I assumed we would have a pleasant experience and I LOVE Asia de Cuba in NYC. I was wrong!  When we arrived at the Clift, the doorman did not even open the door or even aknowledge our pressence. Check-in was smooth but the girl was certainly rushing us and annoyed with any questions. Our original plan was to spend our first night with dinner at Asia De Cuba and start off with some early evening cocktails at the Redwood Room. BIG MISTAKE. Upon check-in we asked if we needed reservations for the Redwood Room. The girl gave us some &quot;preferred customer&quot; cards of some sort which she explained would get us right in with no problem. We approached the hostess at about 730 pm. There were a couple of guys in front of us whom the hostess was assisting. As we patiently waited, a large group came up behind us. The matron of the group approached the hostess - cutting in front of everyone else AND interrupting the conversation between the hostess and the 2 guys. Rather than telling this RUDE woman to go stand in line actually assisted her! The guys in front of us looked apalled and we were infuriated. Once it was finally our turn (like that mattered to the hostess) she very rudely told us we couldnt come in without a reservation. She said she had people arriving at 9 pm. We explained we just wanted ONE pre-dinner cocktail. At this point she got even more rude. At this point we decided this was NOT a place we wanted to spend out money anyways. They obviously dont care about their actual guests! The scene was horrible anyways. I dont think there was a patron under the age of 65 in the entire bar.... so much for a &quot;hip&quot; bar scene. We tried to complain to a manager but he was too busy having a personal conversation with one of the doormen. We decided our money is better spent elsewhere and opted against dinner in the hotel. We had a lovely meal in the Marina district then went on to drinks at Matrix where our patronage was appreciated and our drinks were not accompanied with a side of rudeness. I might also point out the martinis are $8 at Matrix as opposed to the overpriced drinks Redwood Room with serve you along with their snooty attitude. We are from LA so we are no strangers to attitude but this was just plain RUDE.  Aside from the horrible experience our first night, the hotel lobby is quite nice. The rooms are VERY small and somewhat dirty. The bathroom is appalling - dirty towels, the fan doesnt work, no standing room. On our final day, the anger from night one had worn off slightly (probably because we spent as little time in the hotel as possible). We were packing our stuff and relaxing from a morning of shopping. The day before, housekeeping entered our room even though we had the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign on the door. Since nothing was taken we ignored it. Now here we are, a mere hour from escaping the Clift, when there is a knock at the door...housekeeping. I explain we are leaving at 1 (check out time) and to please respect the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign. 15 minutes later, another knock at the door. It is the housekeeper AGAIN. I tell her &quot;we are still here&quot; and remind her of our departure time. Sure enough, another knock at the door and who could it be? The SAME housekeeper. At this point we are so frustrated my boyfriend tells her to wait outside and we gather all our stuff (half packed and all). They clearly wanted us gone so we sprinted to the elevator checked out and left the Clift behind.  Trust me, the Clift offers NOTHING to validate such horrible attitudes and behavior. I had high hopes for this place and if they had impressed me, I would have considered staying there on my monthly business trips up to SF. Forget it. I will definately tell everyone I know NOT to stay here and I will probably never stay at the Morgan again either just because of the Clift affiliation. Trust me, you are better off at the Sir Francis Drake or the Westin. At least they know you exist there and are gracious for your patronage. My advice to the Clift, perhaps you should remember that you are serving your guests not vice versa. Thank you for putting a stain on an otherwise lovely trip.

If you are looking for a clean hotel with a strong minimalist theme then the Nikko may be for you but we would caution that minimalist appears to have been taken to an extreme.

Whilst it may be hard to fault the Nikko's rooms which are comfortable I guess the best way to describe our experience is an ok hotel, in a great location with no soul.

Upon arriving, the doormen and bellman were very courteous and quick to get you in and settled. The lobby is very elegant and has an old time charm to it.

However, some of the guests we had interacted with obviously left their manners at home while on vacation! As far the as the room (we stayed in a deluxe) there wasn't anything all tha deluxe about it. I guess they called it deluxe because of the view which wasn' too bad when the fog wasn't in.

The website made it look great and the reviews I had read were very positive. However, despite the reasonable room rates (I paid 179/night), this is just not a hotel I would return to.GENERAL: The problem with Kimpton hotels, in my opinion, is that they are theme hotels rather than true luxury hotels. The theme of the Palomar is &quot;fancy hotel&quot;. It emulates luxury, but doesn't actually achieve it.LOCATION: The hotel is located very centrally on the corner of Market Street and 4th St. The particular street corner is ridden with somewhat sleazy types, and the building abuts an Old Navy store.LOBBY: I generally enjoy large, open spaces, and the lobby, though well-appointed, was the opposite.ROOMS: TINY!!!!! The very friendly receptionist had even upgraded me to one of the larger rooms, and that was still an extremely small room. The room was nicely appointed but, again, TINY!! The bathroom was so tiny that, sitting on the toilet, my knees nearly touched the cheaply painted-over sliding door that separates the bedroom from the bathroom. The bedding was awful. The pillows were tiny and not firm enough.SERVICE: This is the hotel's one big plus. Everyone from the receptionist to Virgil, the very friendly and knowledgeable concierge, to the bellboys, were professional and courteous.RESTAURANT: The restaurant, Fifth Floor, has received rave reviews on Zagat and elsewhere. It bills itself as a gourmet fine dining restaurant with a star chef. I have eaten in some of the finest restaurants domestically and internationally, and this restaurant just wasn't that great. The service was terrific, but the food, though flavorful and inventive, wasn't worth the $173 price tag (for one person!!). Entrees priced between 40-52 dollars!!!SUMMARY: If you are in dire need of a boutique hotel in San Francisco, go to the W. It's near the Palomar, but it is a first-rate version of itself rather than a second-rate version of another hotel (which is what, sadly, most of the Kimpton hotels are).

The room was fairly large (15' X 15&quot;) with high ceilings, and a large flat screen TV. We were aware of the excessive cost of certain items (internet and parking), and worked around them. Since San Francisco was our final stop on the trip, we turned in our rental car when we arrived at the hotel. And the hotel offers free wireless internet in the lobby (it gets heavy use), although we used our laptop via a telephone internet connection. Even then, we had to pay for outside telephone calls, but it wasn't a problem considering our low hotel rate.The hotel is in an excellent location, just a few blocks from Union Square (easy walk) and in walking distance from the Ferry Building. You can also catch the trolley to Fisherman's Wharf right in front of the hotel. There is also a BART station in front of the hotel.We always request a quiet room location, and on this stay we were given an inside room. In San Francisco, unless you are in a room on a very high floor, you will get more than your share of street noise. So at the Palace, I would recommend the inside rooms -- no view but also no noise. Some other travelers noted the sound from the adjacent rooms and also from the hallway. We also had that experience, but fortunately not in the middle of the night. We could hear the couple next door whose bed shared a wall with ours, but mainly when they woke up a 5am and engaged in loud conversation. We also had hallway noise -- the doors were inclined to slam shut unless you closed them slowly (and many people didn't).The bottom line is that I would definitely stay at the Palace Hotel again. It was a quality experience at a very good price. ANSWERNOTFOUND","was impressed by its elegance at that time. Although the hotel remains elegant, we felt quite comfortable in casual clothes.

It is located in the worst area of San Francisco (Tenderloin). The area is full of junkies, hookers, and homeless people. Even the locals avoid the area. We had to walk around many blocks to avoid that area just to get to our hotel.The room smelled, the walls were thin, and it was extremely loud (until 4 am). The bathroom was absolutely disgusting. The sheets weren't clean (they had &quot;brown&quot; stains ont them. Hookers and junkies hang out right outside the hotel.We would have switched hotels after the first night but we were traveling with friends so we were kind of stuck there.If you are on a budget, you can find nicer hotels in San Francisco. I can't even say, that if you are looking for a good time, this hotel is the place to stay.

I've stayed in the Four Seasons and the Ritz and many other hotels in SF. Four Seasons may have better rooms in terms of architecture and the modern facility, but the location is not desirable (too many homeless wandered nearby and didn't feel safe at night). Nothing stands out at the Ritz; it has no view and its location is mediocre; services were good but the decor is a bit stuffy, old school like, typical of the Ritz chain. The view, services, and location at the MO makes it the best choice for me.I stayed at the Bridge to Bridge View room in July 2006 and the Golden Gate Bridge Mandarin King in August 2007. The main difference is that the Mandarin King has a bathroom with the tub by a large window with fantastic view. From the 48th floor, watching clouds rolling in below us and birds flying by the window, we felt like we were in an airplane. The sky bridge on every floor provides panoramic view of the entire city. Check out my photos for the amazing view.The services at the MO are always top notch. It's not the kind of hotel to nickel and dime its guests (unlike many other five star hotels). The business center offers computers with free internet access and printing (FS and the Ritz charge like $10 for 15 minutes). Also, I called up the room service to inquire about the name of the complementary wine we received upon arrival and was instead offered another complementary bottle. Housekeeping services were good and discreet.Its location is the best compared to the the FS and the Ritz. It's close to Embarcadero and the clock tower, next to a cable car line and the Bart station, within walking distance to Chinatown and the downtown shopping area.The food from the room services were quite good but the taxes, services charges, and gratuity accounted for a third of the bill. I didn't like the fact the the invoice include both 18% gratuity and services charges of $2.5/person, it seems like double charging but at least it's disclosed properly.Overall, the hotel is worth splurging for the best rooms and we plan to come back every summer.

We arrived Friday, late afternoon. No valet parking for my husband, he can't stand to see someone else drive his car, so we spent some time trying to find access to the Union Square Garage (right across the street from the hotel) to park the car. This is a nice feature when you finally get into the garage, much cheaper than paying the valet to park your car in the exact same parking garage. I think we paid $67 for friday-sunday stay, where as the St. Francis charges $50 a day, I believe. Wheeled our luggage across the street to the St. Francis, which had a bustling entrance, cabs in line, valet dudes at the ready, and a steady stream of people walking in and out of the revolving door. When we walked into the hotel, I just wanted to concentrate on getting checked in, so I have to admit to not really noticing the nice entry hall/lobby area of the hotel, although later on, when I had time, I was appreciative. There was a line to check in, but it moved quickly. We booked via Expedia, which I perhaps incorrectly suspect gives us a worse chance of getting a good room, and when I found out we were on the 4th floor, above Union Square, my suspicions were confirmed. We were booked in the older part of the hotel, which I was a bit excited about, ambiance and all that corny stuff. Plus, with no kids on the trip, the character of the older rooms would not be such a big deal. So, up to the fourth floor, big beautiful hallways, marble floor molding, wainscoting, tastefully decorated all the way. Walking into our room, the sheer size of it was impressive. We had booked a King room, and there was plenty of space around the bed to walk, along with two sitting chairs (not comfortable at all) and a small desk and business-type chair (which didn't really go with the decor). The room had a closet, a minibar, flat screen tv, coffee maker with Starbucks and a safe. Nice big window in there as well, overlooking a noisy street. The bath was small, but tastefully decorated. My husband loved the room. He can sleep through anything, so he had some great sleeps during our stay. I am a light sleeper and heard the street noise, which included a band on Friday night right below our window, the usual city sirens, and the banging of the doors in the hallway of the other guests. The bed, I must say, was quite comfortable. It was nice to be in a hotel room without Spongebob on the t.v.! Our experience at the bar later that night was enjoyable, although the prices were a bit steep for us Nevadans. They did serve a wonderful martini though! Coming back from our concert at 2:00 a.m., the hotel lobby was still quite a happening place! It was nice to come back to this beautiful room after a loud, two hour mind numbing concert. Overall, we enjoyed our stay, which I am sure was influenced by the fact that we left the two kids at home, and we decided that next time we would try the modern tower, maybe that would be a quieter experience. The proximity to shopping and food makes this hotel a great choice for a visit to San Francisco. Just ask for a room up a bit from the street!

Since I used to live in SF and travel their quite frequently for work, I am quite familiar with the city and knew we would want to stay in union square (as my boyfriend has never been there and this is the best &quot;touristy&quot; spot). I usually prefer to stay at the Sir Francis Drake or the Westin St. Francis but both were overbooked. I was left with the Clift and Hotel Nikko. I definiately made the wrong choice even though I had heard good things about the lounge and restaurant. Since I have stayed at the Morgan (NYC) several times I assumed we would have a pleasant experience and I LOVE Asia de Cuba in NYC. I was wrong!  When we arrived at the Clift, the doorman did not even open the door or even aknowledge our pressence. Check-in was smooth but the girl was certainly rushing us and annoyed with any questions. Our original plan was to spend our first night with dinner at Asia De Cuba and start off with some early evening cocktails at the Redwood Room. BIG MISTAKE. Upon check-in we asked if we needed reservations for the Redwood Room. The girl gave us some &quot;preferred customer&quot; cards of some sort which she explained would get us right in with no problem. We approached the hostess at about 730 pm. There were a couple of guys in front of us whom the hostess was assisting. As we patiently waited, a large group came up behind us. The matron of the group approached the hostess - cutting in front of everyone else AND interrupting the conversation between the hostess and the 2 guys. Rather than telling this RUDE woman to go stand in line actually assisted her! The guys in front of us looked apalled and we were infuriated. Once it was finally our turn (like that mattered to the hostess) she very rudely told us we couldnt come in without a reservation. She said she had people arriving at 9 pm. We explained we just wanted ONE pre-dinner cocktail. At this point she got even more rude. At this point we decided this was NOT a place we wanted to spend out money anyways. They obviously dont care about their actual guests! The scene was horrible anyways. I dont think there was a patron under the age of 65 in the entire bar.... so much for a &quot;hip&quot; bar scene. We tried to complain to a manager but he was too busy having a personal conversation with one of the doormen. We decided our money is better spent elsewhere and opted against dinner in the hotel. We had a lovely meal in the Marina district then went on to drinks at Matrix where our patronage was appreciated and our drinks were not accompanied with a side of rudeness. I might also point out the martinis are $8 at Matrix as opposed to the overpriced drinks Redwood Room with serve you along with their snooty attitude. We are from LA so we are no strangers to attitude but this was just plain RUDE.  Aside from the horrible experience our first night, the hotel lobby is quite nice. The rooms are VERY small and somewhat dirty. The bathroom is appalling - dirty towels, the fan doesnt work, no standing room. On our final day, the anger from night one had worn off slightly (probably because we spent as little time in the hotel as possible). We were packing our stuff and relaxing from a morning of shopping. The day before, housekeeping entered our room even though we had the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign on the door. Since nothing was taken we ignored it. Now here we are, a mere hour from escaping the Clift, when there is a knock at the door...housekeeping. I explain we are leaving at 1 (check out time) and to please respect the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign. 15 minutes later, another knock at the door. It is the housekeeper AGAIN. I tell her &quot;we are still here&quot; and remind her of our departure time. Sure enough, another knock at the door and who could it be? The SAME housekeeper. At this point we are so frustrated my boyfriend tells her to wait outside and we gather all our stuff (half packed and all). They clearly wanted us gone so we sprinted to the elevator checked out and left the Clift behind.  Trust me, the Clift offers NOTHING to validate such horrible attitudes and behavior. I had high hopes for this place and if they had impressed me, I would have considered staying there on my monthly business trips up to SF. Forget it. I will definately tell everyone I know NOT to stay here and I will probably never stay at the Morgan again either just because of the Clift affiliation. Trust me, you are better off at the Sir Francis Drake or the Westin. At least they know you exist there and are gracious for your patronage. My advice to the Clift, perhaps you should remember that you are serving your guests not vice versa. Thank you for putting a stain on an otherwise lovely trip.

We were on our honeymoon and stayed in 4 different hotels throughout the Napa Valley, Sonoma, and San Francisco. While we stayed in some very nice places, this is the one that we will most remember. The room here was very nice - it was of a good size for the city, was extremely clean, the bed was comfortable with high-quality clean linens. The bathroom was perfectly clean though not very big, but it was perfectly functional with adequate water pressure, plenty of hot water, etc. House keeping did a fine job, no complaints here. Towels, like the linens, were very nice and very clean.What impressed us the most here was the staff. I can't say enough about the people who work at this hotel from the bellmen to the front desk reception crew to the managers. We dealt with Gio at check-in and Theo on multiple occasions for general city information, restaurant recommendations and reservations, etc. This guy loves what he does and he's very good at it - lots of hotels that charge a whole lot more could learn from this staff. When I made my reservation (10 months in advance!) online I mentioned that it would be for our honeymoon... when we checked in before I even mentioned anything we were told that our room was upgraded and we would be on the 8th floor with a view. That night we came to the room after dinner and found a big piece of cake, a card from the staff congratulating us, a bottle of wine (with glasses and corkscrew) all surrounded by rose pedals in a heart shape. We're not snobs and don't expect special treatment these days while traveling for a special occasion... but not a single other hotel on our trip even went as far as saying &quot;congratulations&quot; to us at check-in or anything, whereas Hotel Carlton went above and beyond at check-in, with the gift (at no charge of course), with insisting on special treatment for us when making dinner reservations for us, to wishing us all the best when we checked out. I'm a TripAdvisor regular... I'd read the reviews before I arrived. I was kind of expecting an excellent staff coming in based on the previous reviews... but I was even more impressed than I thought I would be.This is not a hotel that will knock your socks off from a luxury standpoint - but the staff is far superior to the fanciest hotels I have ever stayed at. I'm a Gold VIP member for certain chains and couldn't dream of this kind of can-do attitude. The lobby is nice, the common areas are clean and well-appointed. There's always someone available to help.To be fair, the only remotely negative thing I can say is that the walls are a little thin - but this is a hotel that has been around for a long time, it is very very well maintained and clean - and it has preserved lots of its character. At night things were fairly quiet on the inside, any noise came from the outside with general city noise. The evening wine reception was a nice way to meet members of the staff and other travelers -- lots of people staying here in all age segments and from all around the world. Location was great - I'm from a big city and know how cities tend to be. Sure the Tenderloin area isn't very far, but it's more than a couple of blocks away and there's no reason you'd need to pass through that area to go anywhere anyway. The hotel says it's in Lower Nob Hill - I support that claim. It's about 10-12 min walk to Union Square, central to many great neighbourhoods. Sutter Street has quite a few restaurants, bars, shops. We actually quite enjoyed Sutter Street. Anyway - I would recommend this place to anyone. We paid a price that almost seems too good to be true - and we were extremely impressed.

This was a great value, and you're also put on the highest floor of the building. Our room was on the 23rd floor. The room size is smaller than hotels in other cities, but in comparison to other hotels in San Francisco, this room was fairly large. Turn down service was nice since they put jazz music on the stereo system (included in our club room). There's a TV in the bathroom mirror and the bathroom included a separate shower and tub. The workout area was very nice and I especially liked the steam room and shower head in the spa. I would highly recommend getting the club room at Hotel Nikko, especially if it's minimally more than a regular room. Other hotels we looked at included Hotel Abri and Hotel at Union Square.

I spent many hours trying to decide where to stay. On my last trip in June I chose the Four Seasons; it was a superlative experience and a good value to boot. But I wanted something different. I originally booked the St. Regis, but the numerous Trip Advisor comments about noise worried me; the location of the Ritz Carlton does not appeal to me, so sort of by default that got me to the Mandarin Oriental.After reading all the reviews of this property, I can say that I understand both the positive and the negative comments. No hotel is perfect (or at least I haven't been there yet!), so it really depends on what you value for your money. Let me start with the positives.1. As everyone says, the view is unbeatable. I had an executive king with a view south and west. I could see some of the Bay Bridge, but very little of the Golden Gate. If that view is important to you, you need to book a higher category room. Expect to pay $100-200 more per night for that privilege. And, as others have noted, there is no guarantee that you will have that view if there is thick fog, as there was for most of my stay.2. I loved the layout and decor of the room. In fact, I was shown a bridge to bridge room and a Mandarin king (the pricey one) and the living area in my room was more spacious. The color scheme (red, gold, white) is cheerful yet soothing. The furnishings, art work, throw pillows, bamboo plant, sheer blinds, etc. are all lovely. The bed linens were top of the line, really, really silky smooth. Great air conditioning, although I'm not sure I really needed it in the chilly August fog. 3. The hotel is very quiet for a big city. I think being on the 41st floor keeps out a lot of street noise. I heard doors in the halls, but not people, even on a fully booked Saturday night. There are only about 15 rooms per floor, divided by the walkway, so there just aren't that many guests to make noise. Now for the not so good.1. As a luxury hotel bathroom junkie, the M.O. was a bit disappointing. Mine was a bit small, with a very narrow tub. There are appeared to be three types of wall covering, the ugliest of which is in the separate shower. In the other rooms I saw the walls of the separate shower were marble where mine was just ugly yellow tile. The Mandarin King bath with the tub by the window is lovely, but it does not compare to the bath at the Four Seasons. The towels were a bit scratchy and I didn't care for the toiletries. I went from two bathmats on the first day, to one on the second to none of the third. Housekeeping must have forgotten. But the room itself was super clean.2. The public areas of the hotel are sort of dark and pretty small. I don't spend time in public areas, so this didn't matter to me. But the appeal of the hotel is on the upper floors. It's really too bad that Silks has no natural light windows because it is a pretty space.3. I was on a breakfast package so I had two meals in Silks and one from room service. They were okay. Be aware that you are kept to a $32 per per person maximum for the package. At the Four Seasons they just paid whatever I spent (one breakfast upwards of $50). 4. For the non-smokers: this hotel is pretty lax about smoking in rooms. I was told the only floor where smoking was allowed was on the 48th, but there was definitely a fresh cigarette smell in my 41st floor room on Saturday night. One of the staff told me that they don't charge people for smoking in non-smoking rooms as there are a lot of Asian and European clients who smoke. I found this annoying.5. No wifi the rooms, ethernet connection only. Not enough information about TV channels and no info on PPV. 6. The staff did not impress me much. Check in was chaotic -- the person serving me seemed not to know what she was doing, and there was a problem processing my credit card. It turns out it was the M.O. system and not my card, but the 15 minutes spent trying to figure this out was embarassing and annoying. I found the breakfast server unfriendly.But these negatives do not outweigh the positives, and all things considered, I would definitely stay here again.

Found alot of the hotels in San Fran to be pricey. The hotel and room is very modern. It was comfortable, but there is a dodgy green/blue colour in the room which makes it feel cold. Parking is not complimentary, and is approx $50 a day in hotel car park. I would recommend to go accross the street to a public park, which is about $25 for 24 hours parking. Wifi was not free either in the rooms. The staff were not particularly over friendly either. They just did their job, and really didn't put anything extra into their work.

The price through their &quot;Cheap is Chic&quot; special on their website was $109, which can't be beat for the central location. THE GOOD: Cheap!! Great Location!! It's within walking distance to everything around Union Square- The square itself, the shopping, the theatres (it's right across the street from one), restaurants, the Market-Powell Cable Car line (takes you to Fisherman's Wharf for $5/one way), Chinatown, Civic Center, Nob Hill, etc. There's a drugstore (it was either a Walgreens or Eckerds) about a block or less away which is convenient and there's a Starbucks right next door. There's also a Borders bookstore several blocks away, about a 6 minute walk. The decor was great (although I did overhear an older couple complaining about how it was &quot;too modern&quot;). It's decorated in greys, blues, with punches of orange and a lot of metal (the furniture and &quot;headboard&quot;) (you can check it out on the website). The room and bathroom were both super clean and well equipped. There are a selection of magazines (NYLON, a local fashion magazine, etc.), the toiletries smell amazing, and there's a cute little welcome bag with freebies and goodies in there like emergen-C, toothpaste, an energy drink sample, Nivea face body cream, etc. There's also a distinct &quot;DIVA!&quot; theme or &quot;personality&quot; (as they call it) throughout your stay, which may strike some as being over the top and definitely oriented to a young, hip, female crowd. (I thought it was fun and a welcome change from stuffier hotels but my fiance definitely rolled his eyes a couple times). There's a small desk and chair, a comfy bed (super smooth sheets), a dresser (it looks like a lateral file cabinet) and the tv is wall-mounted (like in a hospital). There's an iron and ironing board, safe, and full-length mirror in the closet. The bathroom also had really nice modern fixtures. There are &quot;offices&quot; on several floors with a computer and internet access (but no printer). There is also AIR CONDITIONING!! A lot of places in San Francisco don't have air conditioning since it's usually pretty cool but it's nice for the rare &quot;heat wave&quot; like the one they had recently. The service is incredible! The concierge was helpful for arranging our transportation to the airport, as well as fielding our questions about the area.THE &quot;BAD&quot;: Note, most of these observations aren't unique to The Diva since they pretty much apply to any of the boutique hotels in the area. The rooms are small, but any decent hotel in the Union Square area at this price will be small- Even then, it's only really small if there are two people staying in the room. And the decor more than makes up for it. I would rather stay at a nice, clean, modern place than get a larger room in a depressing motel-ish place. Try to get a room away from the street- Our room faced Geary Street and it gets pretty loud at night. Turning on the air conditioning / fan helped mask the noise and it didn't bother my fiance but I slept with earplugs. (It didn't bother me enough to ask for a different room). There's no minifridge and the cable TV options were pretty poor (although, again, you're probably not in Union Square to sit around, eating from your minifridge, and watching a lot of TV! The one thing that was kind of annoying was how dark it was since the lamps weren't that strong.The location is perfectly safe- There are a lot of affluent shops around Union Square so people forget that San Francisco has a huge, HUGE homeless population and a huge, HUGE drug problem. And that it's a pretty dirty city (like NYC dirty but better since there aren't as many people). You may smell the distinct odor of pee on one street and then you'll be standing in front of a swanky shop. You're going to be aware of people asking you for change, food, etc. It's not like you're on the streets of Calcutta, but you'll pretty much see a homeless person or junky on every street. Occasionally, someone might start going crazy and yelling at someone or no one in particular on the street (this happened to me). But there are tons of people out and about (due to the theatre-goers and restaurants and bars) so we felt comfortable, even relatively late at night. Most of the hotels lining Geary street have 24-hour doormen or people at the front desk, which gives you the comforting sense that there are at least several eyes and ears open at all times to the street. Who Will Not Enjoy Union Square / The Diva Hotel: If you are looking for quaint, warm, or traditional, you probably won't like The Diva since you may feel the decor at the hotel is too industrial or &quot;cold&quot; and modern. And on a delicate note...If you're part of an &quot;older crowd&quot; used to staying at large established chain hotels, you may not like The Diva since it definitely has an almost aggressively youthful &quot;tone&quot; which can be interpreted as fun, or annoying, depending on your point of view. Also, like my fiance's parents, if you're going to be uncomfortable staying in an area that is vibrant and centrally located but definitely urban and somewhat seedy looking on some streets and with a population of homeless people and drug addicts, then stay at the hermetically sealed (and very nice but expensive) Westin in the area, or at one of the nice hotels on bucolic Nob Hill (trust me, no panhandlers will be trekking up those ridiculously steep hills). We also stayed at the Savoy (and ate at the Millenium for about 5 days, leaving with thinner wallets and fatter waistlines) and wrote a review of those on Tripadvisor as well if you're interested!Have a great time in San Francisco!

I requested a North facing room because these rooms have heavenly views of the San Francisco Bay, Alcatraz and Coit tower. We had booked three rooms, and no one received a North-facing room. On the second night we all obtained North facing rooms, however these were all on lower levels (i.e. floor 27 and lower). This wasn't a problem for us, as we still had Regency club access and were still high enough to have a lovely view. The rooms were average at best. Nothing that special, except that the beds were fantastic. Small TV in bathroom was a nice perk.REGENCY CLUB: If you have the extra $$$, by all means upgrade to the Regency club. There is breakfast every morning (i.e. croissants, bagels, cereal, TONS of fresh fruit, cheese, ham, juice, coffee etc) and a cocktail hour from 4-7 pm which includes hot appetizers, dips, sodas (wine/spirits $4.00/each). But the real reason to join the regency club is: the view fantastic overlooking Coit Tower, the Bay. Who wouldn't want to wake up to this every morning?!

When we made our reservation we were torn between booking two separate non-suite rooms or the adjoining two bedroom suite. We ended up going with the two separate rooms because of the giant cost difference. When we arrived at Hotel Drisco to check in, we were told that my parent's room had been upgraded to a suite, however both rooms were located in the basement, down the hall from the service entrance, across from an ice machine and the breakfast room. Our windows overlooked the kitchen of the hotel and the rooms were very dark. Needless to say we were disappointed and considered switching hotels, however the desk staff was able to move us both into an adjoining two bedroom suite on the corner of the top floor. The new rooms had beautiful light, gorgeous views of the Bay and Alcatraz and it was like we were staying in a completely different hotel. We loved, loved loved our new rooms.The adjoined two bedroom suites are great if you're traveling as a group, however one of the bedrooms in these two bedroom suites has no bathroom attached. You have to cross the private hall (to which both bedrooms in the suite have access) to get to the bathroom. If the person staying in the other bedroom is not traveling with you, you could conceivably be walking out of your shower into your room and pass a stranger in the hall. It was a bit bizarre. I would recommend this hotel ONLY if you are given a room on the top two floors. It would be quite loud otherwise, and much less private. The only problem is, you are given no guarantees as to where your room is until you check in. It's a bit of a gamble. Also, beware. The prices of rooms fluctuate. When we were moved to the double room suite, the price we were quoted at the desk was nearly $100 less per night than what we were quoted when we originally made the decision to stick with the smaller, single rooms. That said, bathrooms in both suites and non-suites were beautiful and large, the breakfast were very nice, and Thanh (sp?) the bellhop/doorman was so kind and friendly. We loved the private, neighborhood feel of Pacific Heights. There are some great nearby restaurants (try Sociale) and the buses run frequently if you're wanting to go further afield. There's also a complimentary town car service running to Union Square every morning between 7 and 9, which is handy. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2526, 2540)",2,0.0,False

As she interned in San Francisco during college, we decided to head out there for some R&amp;R. As I usually make the travel plans, I choose this hotel based on the Marriot name, the excellent location, and the ambiance of the place. *Check In-No problems with check in. We got in around noon, and were easily checked in to our room. Each time we dealt with the front desk, they went above and beyond professional customer service to take care of us. *Room-The room more than suited our needs. Granted, we did not have the best view (The record store across the street), but the room was rather beautiful. As some may have read, the BEDS were probably the most comfortable I have ever slept in, including my own! I think they use plush down comforters, but I slept so beautifully each night.*Breakfast at the Restaurant-I live in Jersey City, across the Hudson from Manhattan. I know expensive places, and am accustomed to them. With that said, I also realize hotels jack up the prices of their food. However, the price of the breakfast was close to $30, quite expensive! Food was pretty good, but this was not the best value.*Bar-The bar was a nice place to relax, watch some sports and get a drink while my girlfriend got ready to go out. The drinks were somewhat expensive, but again, living in the NYC area, I am used to paying $5-7 for a Heineken. This was the same. Besides the pricing, it had a nice ambiance to it*Conceirge-Well, the good news of the trip was that I proposed to my girlfriend, now fiance! The night of the proposal, I wanted to take her to a nice restaurant. The conceirge was so helpful in getting us a nice romantic place to eat at. He was also excited for us. I work in a service oriented industry, where customer service makes or breaks a company. He certainly was very professional and courteous. He even remembered our engagement the next night he was working and congratulated us again!*Location-The location was pretty descent for us. Although my fiance is not into staying in touristy areas, she did enjoy the location of our hotel, as it was close to alot of places and/or public transportation. It was not too far from Fisherman's Wharf, and was a quiet part of town. The only downside to Fisherman's Wharf was the overpriced restuarants serving breakfast. Living in NYC, breakfast is cheap, even in a Manhattan diner. However, here, could not find french toast for less than $10-12. *ParkingWe flew out and took a taxi to the hotel from SFO, so we did not have to pay for parking. However, I did see it was rather expensive, so I would advise not parking in their lot. *OVERALL-This place met all our needs. They were courteous, the beds were extremely comfortable, and you cannot beat the location. I would definitely reccommend this hotel to someone traveling to Fisherman's Wharf!!

There's a (pricey) small grocery store a block away so you can load up on snacks, etc.If you're lucky, you'll meet Mary and Vivian, the San Francisco twins.

Fortunately, Southwest was offering a great DING internet fare of $45.00 each way for an upcoming weekend. I grabbed the fare and started doing some bidding on Priceline. I knew I wanted to be around Union Square and went to biddingfortravel.com for advice. Eventually, I landed the Hilton SF for $74.00 per night plus tax and fee for two nights. I thought it was a great bargain until I read the reviews on tripadvisor.com. The hotel charges for use of the fitness center/spa ($15.00) as well as accessing the internet ($15.99 for 24 hours). As a business traveler I expect to pay for the internet, but I never had to pay as much as $15.99. It was even more insulting when I got to the hotel. One connects to the internet via an ethernet cord. It is not even a wireless service for the unreasonably high price.I got to the hotel via BART from the airport. The cost was $5.30 and the BART (subway) was a few blocks away from the Hilton. It is incredibly close and convenient walk from the Powell Street station. I entered the hotel from the garage and eventually found my way to the front desk. As a silver Hilton Honors member I went to the empty Hilton Honors line. As I approached the clerk he said he had called someone from the main check-in line who had not made it to his station yet. He, in a not so nice way, said I would need to wait.No big deal, although his attitude, I could have done without. I waited and after about 2-3 minutes, went to another station staffed by a clerk came who eventually came out from the back office to check me in. She was very friendly and greeted me warmly. I knew to ask for a room on the high floor, since I had done my research on tripadvisor and the clerk was very accomodating. I politiely asked for a the quietest room on the highest floor possible. She said she would do the best she could taking note of my Hilton Honors card and Hitlon affinity credit card. Then the dreaded, I see your room is pre-paid through Priceline. came out. I feared the Priceline room but I was very pleased when she said she had a room on the 44th floor in Tower 1. I asked if it was a quiet room and if it had one bed. She assurred me it was quiet and had a king bed. The room was 1-4471. Also, she let me know as a Hilton Honors member, there were two Nestle brand water bottles in the mini-bar I could have for no charge. Nice touch, I thought. I found the elevator for Tower One and took the long ride up to the 44th floor. I was very disappointed to get a room right off the elevator but was happier once I opened the door. The room was a nice size with a spectacular view of the city and the Golden Gate bridge. The rest of the room was fairly standard with a comfortable king size bed, desk, sofa, standard tv, two telephones, mini-bar, and coffee maker. The bathroom was also of a high quality with standard Hilton bath products, big fluffy towels, a bathtub with shower, and a robe. Overall, I was pleased until I heard the noise of the elevator.So, I called the front desk to see if their was a similar room in the same tower on the same floor. The clerk said she would check but eventually came back on the line and said the only room available was on the 30th floor. I didn't push it, but was fairly certain she was not telling the truth. I decided to stay, and deal with the slight rumbling, since the view was amazing. Yet,, I was sad to find out the rooms on the 44th floor were not all taken. I confirmed this with the housekeeping staff when I asked the housekeeper the following morning. The room was very stuffy, so I turned the air conditioner on. Then I unpacked and decided to take a walk into the Mission District. I wanted to grab a burrito this area of the city is famous for. Although the immediate area around the hotel is well lit and safe, a few blocks away is the Tenderloin district. It is not the greatest area and one should be careful in getting directions and walking around at night. I ate a delicious chicken burrito before walking about 20 minutes back to the hotel.I got back to my room and noticed the room was not significantly colder. I thought the system must be guided by a motion detector so I turned the thermostat lower hoping the room would get colder quickly. I went to check my emails and was very surprised to see the hotel did not have wi-fi. I had to use an ethernet cord at the desk. I was even more surprised to see the price of $15.99 for 24 hours worth of service. That has been the highest price I have paid for internet access, which has typically been $12.99 at Marriott's and other Hitlon properties. Oh well, nickle and dime I thought. After checking emails I went to look at the room service and mini bar menu's. Typical over-priced, inflated charges. I knew I wasn't going to pay those prices especially since there was a drug store close by for soda and munchies. Furthermore, I was glad the hotel was close to Chinatown, the Mission, and other restaurants less expensive. To the hotels credit, the in-room coffee was decent and the coffee machine easy to use. After looking at the view for a while, I decided to watch some tv and go to bed. The tv was not a flat screen, kind of surprising for this level hotel, but they had enough channels to keep my occupied. The bed, as well, was very comfortable. I fell asleep quickly and woke up feeling refreshed. I had a great nights sleep.I made some coffee, took a hot bath and got dressed, I left my room at 10:30 AM to explore the city. The Hilton is an great location. There is great shopping all around Union Square. I browsed through some of my favorite stores - Tumi, Old Navy, Macy's etc....before walking to the fairly new Contemporary Jewish Museum. The museum is unique building with an interesting history and very accomodating. After spending a few hours at the museum, I walked to China town and found a place for dim sum. I do not remember the name of the restaurant but the dim sum was delicious. I finished eating and walked back to the hotel to rest. I had a facial appointment at 4 PM at a spa located on 111 Maiden Lane. Maiden Lane is a really cool, small street with shops, art galleries, and restaurants, right off of Union Square. Alla is a fantastic skin technican and gave an excellent facial, at a lower price than the Hilton spa. My day was perfect - interesting, relaxing, with a good, reasonably priced dim sum lunch.I walked back to the hotel and went into my room. It was significantly hotter during the day, so I was surprised my room was really warm when I entered. I lowered the thermostat as low as I could and, then, called the desk to ask for an engineer to check the air conditioning. An engineer arrived promptly and started working on the system. He took about 1/2 hour and eventually said their was a broken part. I think he said it was a regulator. He told me he would need to get the part and would come back to fix the system. Boy, was I surprised when I got a call from the hotel operator saying my air conditoner could not be fixed and did I want to change rooms. I did want to change rooms but only if I could get a similar room on the same floor. He said he would check but called back soon after offereing me a room on the 30th floor. I chuckled to myself. Here we go again I thought as I asked him to check once again. My floor did not seem full so I was disappointed when he called back to say no. At tleast he asked if would I like help moving my belongings. I did not want to go through the hassle of moving knowing the room would cool down eventually at night, so I declined. I decided to full around with the windows and eventually figured out how to open two of the side windows. The room cooled down fairly quickly but I think this situation was poorly handled. It should not have been difficult to accomodate my request and I felt, because I was a Priceline guest, would not a room of similar quality. Oh well, this only meant I would most likely never stay here again, even on the company dime. Poor, discriminating, untruthful, service is simply bad policy in my book, especially when this hotel was not close to being fully occupied. Upon check-out I noticed I was charged for the water I used in the mini-bar. When I questioned the clerk to say I was told the water was free for HIlton Honor guests members, she replied in a surly fashion, Priceline guests do not get Hilton Honor amentities. I knew I would not get HH points and I replied as nicely as I could, that I was not asking for HH points for my stay. I simply wanted to get what was offered to me complimentary by the initial front desk clerk - the Nestle water. She said the front desk clerk who checked me in made a mistake, but would take the $6.00 mini-bar charge for two bottled waters off my bill. Nevertheless, in spite of the surliness, the high price for internet access and use of the fitness room, and a broken air conditioner, I had a reasonably pleasant stay. Yet, I would never, ever want to pay rack rates. Between the nickle and diming of the fitness center and internet - and the poor attitude presented to me as a Priceline guest - I would never come back to this hotel onmy or anyone else's dime ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(9207, 9221)",1,0.0,False

The valet service and the check-in were friendly and efficient, with our package details clearly spelled out. However, there was a snafu with the bags and I ended up having to go back downstairs to get them myself. The room was nicely appointed and clean. The room size was fairly small, not surprising for an older hotel but adequate for 2 people. Elevators were a bit slow, but acceptable considering the property is 80 years old.The Top of the Mark was great for late evening drinks (no kids allowed, drinks average $10 and proper dress is expected) with wonderful nighttime views of the city. Breakfast was outstanding, a high quality buffet with panaromic views stretching from downtown to Alcatraz and the Golden Gate Bridge. There is a cable car stop outside which can get you around, otherwise you are looking at a VERY steep walk to get down to Union Square and a real killer to walk back up Powell to California Street. Checkout was a bit slow, but all charges were clearly explained, unlike some earlier posters who seemed to have problems. Maybe it helps to be an InterContinental member. The car was waiting outside with no delay.Overall, if you like a place with history and class, this is a great place to stay. The package value I received was outstanding, for $219 a great room, parking ($50) and breakfast for two ($52 value) included. Classic architecture, romantic history and a fabulous view of a wonderful city make for a memorable stay. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1707, 1721)",1,0.0,False

The Ritz Carlton is a beautiful hotel! The lobby is gorgeous and the hallways are decorated with artwork from local artists that depict famous landmarks and scenes. After flying into San Fran from NYC it was late and all of the restaurants were closed luckily there is 24 hour room service! It is expensive. My husband and I ordered: (salty) chicken fingers and fries, cheeseburger/fries along with two sodas and it came to $60. I later read the fine print on the receipt and there is a $4 delivery charge so I think there is no need to tip? I did anyway. I also ordered room service the next day for breakfast which was a 3 egg omelet (cheese, spinach) along w/toast and a coffee that came to $40. After the first day no more room service, though I must say the breakfast was superb. The room was spacious and the sheets were phenomenal (400 thread count, make it hard to get out of bed). The Ritz also has different pillows to accommodate you (fluffy, soft, hard). The room had a 32' flat screen television with a wide selection of movies to order from. Wireless internet service is available. The room was also equipped with a Bose system that allowed you to plug in your ipod. Bulgari also provides all of your toiletries. I loved the turn down service! I would come back to my room exhausted and have chocolates on my bed, a copy of the latest headlines from the New York Times, and the local jazz station playing. It was so relaxing and thoughtful. The location is perfect and a 2 minute walking distance to Chinatown, Union Square (tons of shopping), bus stops, trolley stops,and Grace Cathedral.The entire staff was very knowledgeable. I needed walking directions to the murals on balmy avenue and there was a line at the concierge (also extremely helpful) so one of the bellhops just asked how can I help you? How awesome is that? He gave me directions and I was on my way. I wish I had gotten his name because he was very helpful. The cleaning staff was awesome, I think my cleaning ladies name was Yalitza? she was phenomenal.The only problem I had with my room (#360) was that it is what I would consider the bottom floor. In order to access the room you have to take the elevator one floor down to the 3rd floor (which I think is the conference room floor), then walk down some stairs to access my room. It was directly across from the kitchen? and above the beautiful courtyard. Besides the steps which is not recommended for disabled visitors, it was loud on the last 2 days of my stay. There might have been a wedding or some function that lasted what seemed like 3 in the morning. I also think hotel guests would go there to have a smoke or drink with friends which equals loud noise. To be honest I expect to have a great room at the Ritz especially for someone who pays $500 a night. I was a tad bit disappointed in the room. I am sure I could have switched rooms but it was late and I did not expect to hear noise two nights in a row. I have visited the Ritz Carlton in New Orleans and they are all beautiful hotels with attentive staff. All in all I enjoyed my stay at the Ritz Carlton and I would visit again.I hope this review helps someone.

The biggest downside was the breakfast bar was packed to capacity every morning, probably because there were 170 kids in two groups on Spring Break trips. That meant we had often had to watch like hawks to get a table and many people didn't have a clue about how to clean up after themselves. However, the breakfasts were great with doughnuts, hard-boiled eggs, fresh fruit, hot cinnamon buns, cereal, and toast/English muffins. There also isn't a laundry facility onsite so we had to go next door to the Holiday Inn (not HI Express).

In particular, the granola was excellent and the pecan rolls and almond croissants melted in your mouth.

The lobby of the tower building was very elegant and attractive, while the lobby of the main hotel maintained a nice mix of the historic architecture and modern decor.  We took advantage of the mid-week special dinner menu for St. Francis guests at Michael Mina, which was wonderful, and a fraction of the cost of the more extensive normal menu.

We're not snobs and don't expect special treatment these days while traveling for a special occasion... but not a single other hotel on our trip even went as far as saying &quot;congratulations&quot; to us at check-in or anything, whereas Hotel Carlton went above and beyond at check-in, with the gift (at no charge of course), with insisting on special treatment for us when making dinner reservations for us, to wishing us all the best when we checked out. I'm a TripAdvisor regular... I'd read the reviews before I arrived. I was kind of expecting an excellent staff coming in based on the previous reviews... but I was even more impressed than I thought I would be.This is not a hotel that will knock your socks off from a luxury standpoint - but the staff is far superior to the fanciest hotels I have ever stayed at. I'm a Gold VIP member for certain chains and couldn't dream of this kind of can-do attitude. The lobby is nice, the common areas are clean and well-appointed. There's always someone available to help.To be fair, the only remotely negative thing I can say is that the walls are a little thin - but this is a hotel that has been around for a long time, it is very very well maintained and clean - and it has preserved lots of its character. At night things were fairly quiet on the inside, any noise came from the outside with general city noise. The evening wine reception was a nice way to meet members of the staff and other travelers -- lots of people staying here in all age segments and from all around the world. Location was great - I'm from a big city and know how cities tend to be. Sure the Tenderloin area isn't very far, but it's more than a couple of blocks away and there's no reason you'd need to pass through that area to go anywhere anyway. The hotel says it's in Lower Nob Hill - I support that claim. It's about 10-12 min walk to Union Square, central to many great neighbourhoods. Sutter Street has quite a few restaurants, bars, shops. We actually quite enjoyed Sutter Street. Anyway - I would recommend this place to anyone. We paid a price that almost seems too good to be true - and we were extremely impressed. A big thanks to Theo, Gio, and the entire staff. You guys really made for a memorable last few days of our honeymoon and we appreciate it.

The rooms are nicely and elegantly decorated, and the windows are large and plentiful with good views of the city. I was dissapointed; however, that we did not recieve a room with views of the Golden Gate. I suppose I had to request this seperately. Anyway, the bed was big and comfy. Great pillows; I slept very well. The bathroom was my favorite. It had a large, deep tub overlooking the city. However, the tub is only big enough to fit one person at a time. The service was good; they were very attentive. Although I must warn you, you will get outrageously charged for everything you do. We wanted to eat at an Indian resturant, so we called the front desk and asked them directions to a nearby Indian place. They were very nice, and even printed out directions for us. However, when we checked-out, we saw that we had been charged $6.00 just for having someone tell us where to eat at. We also had room-service ordered. It was $80 for two entrees and an appetizer. Normally that wouldn't bother me if the food was good, but it was not. In fact, I couldn't even eat most of it because it was so gross. I had the pan-seared seabass. It was way over-cooked and was placed ontop of bland mashed potatoes and prego spaghetti sauce. We also had breakfast ordered the next morning. Breakfast was better, but it was still ridiculously expensive. $50 for two breakfast entrees. A glass of orange juice is $6.00! For a hotel that is so high-class, I was not expecting to pay such outrageous prices for something I could get elsewhere for much, much less. Also, everyone expetcs to be tipped. This gets tiring after a while. Oh, I should mention that in the morning we stopped by MO bar to get a water and a coke. The waiter brought out what I thought was complimentary biscottis along with our drinks because we did not request them. If I knew that we would be paying $9.00 for a water and a coke, there is no way we would have stopped at the bar.

It was the most reasonably priced hotel that we could find. At the time of booking, parking was said to be free. That policy changed, before we checked in, but the guy at the desk was very passive, and waived the fee for us. The location of the hotel is VERY close to public transportation (which was clean, convenient and safe). The first day took a little adjusting to the transient people wandering around, but then I realized that my church is located in a similar area...so no big deal. They really didn't bother us at all. The hotel itself was very clean and the staff was pleasant and helpful. Our room was a bit noisy because of the courtyard configuration (and the fact that each door &quot;bangs&quot; shut and echos through the courtyard), but it wasn't a deal breaker. The pool area was nice, but the saunas were out of service (and looked a little sketchy).

First, the location is absolutely perfect. From the hotel, Union Square is a short walk away, the Chinatown gate is within a block or two, and all of the MUNI lines are available at Market street a block or two in the other direction. It made an excellent base of operations for our many trips exploring the city.The room itself was a bit on the small side, but more than sufficient for the two of us. The decor and ambiance throughout were modern and classy. One slight downside is that our room was on the inside, so the window looked out to an open area with hotel on all four sides. I'd call it a courtyard, but it wasn't pretty, and I think it just held things like air conditioners and the like.On the other hand, if you do want to get outside without going far, the hotel has a nifty rooftop park with plants and a walking/running track. That was pretty nice to get some fresh air. There's also a complimentary wine hour, which we attended once, and didn't return since the wine was so awful. I can't really complain about free wine, but I certainly wouldn't plan my schedule around it.Overall, the Galleria Park was a very nice hotel and we had a pleasant stay there. It was pretty expensive, but that may just be SF in general, rather than this hotel specifically. Also, there's a pretty hefty charge for the valet parking, but the valets were very friendly and helpful. Besides that, no complaints, and it really is in the perfect location.

We got it from Sunday to Wednesday for $135 a night, which was a great deal and I think very good value. It's certainly worth the booking price via their own website but you can find a good deal out there for it too.The Tuscan Inn was a great place to stay. It's very close to Fisherman's Wharf, within walking distance to the Coit Tower and even Chinatown. The street cars are also only a block away. The rooms are very nice and seem recently upgraded. The beds and linens are quite nice too.The hotel staff are really friendly. We were very impressed with both of the concierges that were working and found them extremely useful. The people at the front desk were friendly save for one girl who we found consistently rude and abrasive. (ie, I brought a five dollar bill up to the front desk and before I could say anything she said &quot;we don't give change&quot; and walked away). With the exception of this one bad egg, everyone was very nice.The free wine/beer and coffee/hot chocolate/biscotti is a wonderful touch and we took full advantage of it. I would recommend making reservations at the restaurant as it quickly filled up every night and we were turned away frequently - I heard one traveller get into a heated discussion about never being able to get in for dinner.My only recommendation would be to ask for a room that's not on the first floor, or a room with a view of the garden. The street noise was pretty bad and we were woken up a few times because of this. There were a few homeless people who would sit on the street outside and make a ton of noise throughout the night. Also, the restaurant drags their tables and chairs inside at midnight or later and then outside at 7:00am. It makes a lot of noise too - just a tip.Anyway, we loved it at this hotel and were very happy. Last word of caution - if you're going to San Francisco, don't rent a car.

(St. Francis, the Palace, the Milano, Hyatts, Mariott, Sir Francis Drake, Kensington Park etc.) over the years and this was definately among the best. Many hotels will have nice lobbies, but have very ordinary rooms . The Omni had beautifully furnished luxurious rooms with every imaginable amenitiy. I would recommend it to anyone. As San Francisco is developing more and more to the east of Union Square, restaurants, shopping and attractions are near the Financial District location of the Omni. Plus, the California Cable Car line is right outside. We were in S.F. for the Chinese New Year Parade (a block away), Prom Dress Shopping, (5 min walk) and to attend an event at MoMA (10 minute walk). Nearby Belden Place offers some of San Franciscos best restaurants and a truly european bistro experience, that is entirely family friendly. We had dinner at Brindisi. Make reservations for weekends at any S.F. restaurant.. The hotel valet parking is $45 , high even for San Francisco. However, around the corner on Kearny is a 24 hour city parking lot with security. A bargain. If you join the Omni's &quot;club&quot; before your stay, you also get real pampering including morning coffee delivered to your door with the paper and free internet. We loved it!

Regardless, the service was efficient and friendly. However, the same cannot be said for evening room service. We called down for room service at about 10:30pm and received no response; concierge picked up the phone and he said he would call us back, but no return call was made!

I had brioche french toast with maple syrup and pear and my partner had a cooked breakfast. I don't go for cooked breakfasts because I find them too greasy/heavy, but his looked really good.

Several fifth floor rooms shared a common terrace, but we were afraid that the street noise at that level might be more of a problem.The concierge (Peter) suggested we eat at Colibri, a wonderful restaurant serving Yucatan specialties, rather than the more typical fare one finds at most Mexican restaurants.

Zingari, the hotel's second-floor restaurant-lounge, offers half-price appetizers and $5 house wines from 4-7 p.m. The portions were sufficiently large to serve as dinner for us the night we arrived.The continental breakfast provided excellent orange juice along with oranges, apples, muffins, croissants, breakfast pastries, tea, and coffee in the Club Room on the hotel's top floor.

And although I'm not a very demanding traveler and don't need all the perks associated with some of the more decadent/full-service oriented types, the few times I needed help the excellent service came through. A fax I was expecting was ready for me within 5 minutes, and evey time I asked the concierge to check on my flight or make restaurant reservations it was done immediately.

The bed was extremely comfortable - as was waking up to an almost 180 degree view of SF et environs every morning!! (I will have to bring my girlfriend here sometime).On the negative side, a few minor things. First, there are only 2 elevators which made for a couple minutes of waiting from time to time (usually not a problem). Also, the gym is very small and on the 4th floor with no windows which isn't ideal and not what I'm used to at other MO's (DC and NYC) which have much larger gyms with views and a pool (DC at least) - no pool here (unlike the Ritz and Four Seasons). And the hotel lobby is nice but pretty understated and small so don't expect a grand entrance - the location and views are what you pay for here. I will come back to this hotel, but as I'm a big exerciser I think that the Ritz and Four Season are also great choices if you want a larger gym and pool.

Fortunately, Southwest was offering a great DING internet fare of $45.00 each way for an upcoming weekend. I grabbed the fare and started doing some bidding on Priceline. I knew I wanted to be around Union Square and went to biddingfortravel.com for advice. Eventually, I landed the Hilton SF for $74.00 per night plus tax and fee for two nights. I thought it was a great bargain until I read the reviews on tripadvisor.com. The hotel charges for use of the fitness center/spa ($15.00) as well as accessing the internet ($15.99 for 24 hours). As a business traveler I expect to pay for the internet, but I never had to pay as much as $15.99. It was even more insulting when I got to the hotel. One connects to the internet via an ethernet cord. It is not even a wireless service for the unreasonably high price.I got to the hotel via BART from the airport. The cost was $5.30 and the BART (subway) was a few blocks away from the Hilton. It is incredibly close and convenient walk from the Powell Street station. I entered the hotel from the garage and eventually found my way to the front desk. As a silver Hilton Honors member I went to the empty Hilton Honors line. As I approached the clerk he said he had called someone from the main check-in line who had not made it to his station yet. He, in a not so nice way, said I would need to wait.No big deal, although his attitude, I could have done without. I waited and after about 2-3 minutes, went to another station staffed by a clerk came who eventually came out from the back office to check me in. She was very friendly and greeted me warmly. I knew to ask for a room on the high floor, since I had done my research on tripadvisor and the clerk was very accomodating. I politiely asked for a the quietest room on the highest floor possible. She said she would do the best she could taking note of my Hilton Honors card and Hitlon affinity credit card. Then the dreaded, I see your room is pre-paid through Priceline. came out. I feared the Priceline room but I was very pleased when she said she had a room on the 44th floor in Tower 1. I asked if it was a quiet room and if it had one bed. She assurred me it was quiet and had a king bed. The room was 1-4471. Also, she let me know as a Hilton Honors member, there were two Nestle brand water bottles in the mini-bar I could have for no charge. Nice touch, I thought. I found the elevator for Tower One and took the long ride up to the 44th floor. I was very disappointed to get a room right off the elevator but was happier once I opened the door. The room was a nice size with a spectacular view of the city and the Golden Gate bridge. The rest of the room was fairly standard with a comfortable king size bed, desk, sofa, standard tv, two telephones, mini-bar, and coffee maker. The bathroom was also of a high quality with standard Hilton bath products, big fluffy towels, a bathtub with shower, and a robe. Overall, I was pleased until I heard the noise of the elevator.So, I called the front desk to see if their was a similar room in the same tower on the same floor. The clerk said she would check but eventually came back on the line and said the only room available was on the 30th floor. I didn't push it, but was fairly certain she was not telling the truth. I decided to stay, and deal with the slight rumbling, since the view was amazing. Yet,, I was sad to find out the rooms on the 44th floor were not all taken. I confirmed this with the housekeeping staff when I asked the housekeeper the following morning. The room was very stuffy, so I turned the air conditioner on. Then I unpacked and decided to take a walk into the Mission District. I wanted to grab a burrito this area of the city is famous for. Although the immediate area around the hotel is well lit and safe, a few blocks away is the Tenderloin district. It is not the greatest area and one should be careful in getting directions and walking around at night. I ate a delicious chicken burrito before walking about 20 minutes back to the hotel.I got back to my room and noticed the room was not significantly colder. I thought the system must be guided by a motion detector so I turned the thermostat lower hoping the room would get colder quickly. I went to check my emails and was very surprised to see the hotel did not have wi-fi. I had to use an ethernet cord at the desk. I was even more surprised to see the price of $15.99 for 24 hours worth of service. That has been the highest price I have paid for internet access, which has typically been $12.99 at Marriott's and other Hitlon properties. Oh well, nickle and dime I thought. After checking emails I went to look at the room service and mini bar menu's. Typical over-priced, inflated charges. I knew I wasn't going to pay those prices especially since there was a drug store close by for soda and munchies. Furthermore, I was glad the hotel was close to Chinatown, the Mission, and other restaurants less expensive. To the hotels credit, the in-room coffee was decent and the coffee machine easy to use. After looking at the view for a while, I decided to watch some tv and go to bed. The tv was not a flat screen, kind of surprising for this level hotel, but they had enough channels to keep my occupied. The bed, as well, was very comfortable. I fell asleep quickly and woke up feeling refreshed. I had a great nights sleep.I made some coffee, took a hot bath and got dressed, I left my room at 10:30 AM to explore the city. The Hilton is an great location. There is great shopping all around Union Square. I browsed through some of my favorite stores - Tumi, Old Navy, Macy's etc....before walking to the fairly new Contemporary Jewish Museum. The museum is unique building with an interesting history and very accomodating. After spending a few hours at the museum, I walked to China town and found a place for dim sum. I do not remember the name of the restaurant but the dim sum was delicious. I finished eating and walked back to the hotel to rest. I had a facial appointment at 4 PM at a spa located on 111 Maiden Lane. Maiden Lane is a really cool, small street with shops, art galleries, and restaurants, right off of Union Square. Alla is a fantastic skin technican and gave an excellent facial, at a lower price than the Hilton spa. My day was perfect - interesting, relaxing, with a good, reasonably priced dim sum lunch.I walked back to the hotel and went into my room. It was significantly hotter during the day, so I was surprised my room was really warm when I entered. I lowered the thermostat as low as I could and, then, called the desk to ask for an engineer to check the air conditioning. An engineer arrived promptly and started working on the system. He took about 1/2 hour and eventually said their was a broken part. I think he said it was a regulator. He told me he would need to get the part and would come back to fix the system. Boy, was I surprised when I got a call from the hotel operator saying my air conditoner could not be fixed and did I want to change rooms. I did want to change rooms but only if I could get a similar room on the same floor. He said he would check but called back soon after offereing me a room on the 30th floor. I chuckled to myself. Here we go again I thought as I asked him to check once again. My floor did not seem full so I was disappointed when he called back to say no. At tleast he asked if would I like help moving my belongings. I did not want to go through the hassle of moving knowing the room would cool down eventually at night, so I declined. I decided to full around with the windows and eventually figured out how to open two of the side windows. The room cooled down fairly quickly but I think this situation was poorly handled. It should not have been difficult to accomodate my request and I felt, because I was a Priceline guest, would not a room of similar quality. Oh well, this only meant I would most likely never stay here again, even on the company dime. Poor, discriminating, untruthful, service is simply bad policy in my book, especially when this hotel was not close to being fully occupied. Upon check-out I noticed I was charged for the water I used in the mini-bar. When I questioned the clerk to say I was told the water was free for HIlton Honor guests members, she replied in a surly fashion, Priceline guests do not get Hilton Honor amentities. I knew I would not get HH points and I replied as nicely as I could, that I was not asking for HH points for my stay. I simply wanted to get what was offered to me complimentary by the initial front desk clerk - the Nestle water. She said the front desk clerk who checked me in made a mistake, but would take the $6.00 mini-bar charge for two bottled waters off my bill. Nevertheless, in spite of the surliness, the high price for internet access and use of the fitness room, and a broken air conditioner, I had a reasonably pleasant stay. Yet, I would never, ever want to pay rack rates. Between the nickle and diming of the fitness center and internet - and the poor attitude presented to me as a Priceline guest - I would never come back to this hotel onmy or anyone else's dime ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(9207, 9221)",5,0.0,False

It's right in the middle of some great shopping! Overall we enjoyed our stay with a few little hiccups along the way.The minor issues: 1. The hair dryer in the room was fried and we called the front desk to get a replacement. It never came. We had to call a second time before we got a replacement. The good thing is that at least on the second call we got a response within 15 minutes.2. We cancelled a wake-up call but they called anyway - twice. My husband was there on a conference and I chose to sleep late one morning but the wake-up call he cancelled came anyway and woke me up at 4:30am.The major issue:My husband was in the room taking a break from his conference and I was in the shower. We had the privacy sign out on the door and the privacy lock engaged. The mini-bar attendant (a man) took the sign off the door and wedged it on the wall behind our room number. He knocked briefly and then tried to come right on in. The lock prevented the door from opening more than 4 inches. Initially I was upset because if the privacy sign is out it generally means you don't want to be disturbed. The second reason I was upset was that if my husband wasn't in the room at the time and I had forgotten to engage the privacy lock, ... fill in the blanks. Since the shower is right next to the hotel door you can clearly hear it outside in the hall. My only assumption is that either the employee was trying to walk in on something or he simply disregards people's privacy.In my opinion I think this is a serious security concern. When we discussed it with a member of management, she seemed concerned and said she'd speak to the staff and security about the incident.What's interesting is that between the first phone call to the manager and the time I left the room an hour later, it happened a second time. I happened to be at the door about to go out and saw him through the peep hole. He removed the privacy sign from the door and wedged it on the wall again and then knocked. At least this time he didn't try to enter our room.Just be aware of this when thinking of booking your room there. The main lesson to learn is to always put the privacy sign out and to engage the privacy lock when you don't want anyone barging in. This could have happened at any hotel room in the world so take this lesson with you anywhere you choose to stay.Now for the fun stuff:Grand Views lounge on the 36th floor is worth the view but you'll get sticker shock when ordering any drinks. A plain martini is $12 and it had too much vermouth in it. I couldn't finish it because it was horrible but you won't go wrong with wine or beer. This is a great place to go for a quick cup of coffee to enjoy the view but there are better places to get a drink.Perry's Downtown:This place makes a great burger and is a good place to go for drinks or a good burger and a beer. It's about 2 1/2 blocks away from the Hyatt. It's a good lunch place and a good casual dinner place and is reasonable on the wallet.Steps of Rome Trattoria:North BeachThis is the best Italian food!! I had the Gnocchi alla Serentia and it was fantastic! The place doesn't look like much but the people are friendly and the food is wonderful!Pizza Chicago:Ghiradelli SquareGreat pizza joint in a casual atmosphere. Reasonable and worth every penny!La Suite:On Brannan near the Bay BridgeAmazing french food!!! It's in a higher price range but the food is awesome! The bar is trendy, the drinks very generous and the staff is friendly.Hawthorn Lane:I'm not sure where it's located but the food and atmosphere were amazing. This is among the highest priced restaurants in the city but if you love good food and excellent service this is the place for you. I had the lobster - mmm mmm!Alcatraz evening tour:Ok, so I'm not into cheezy tourist stuff but I enjoyed this tour. If for nothing else, go for the views of the city. It's a neat piece of history to check out and has incredible views of the city, the Golden Gate, Angel Island and the Bay Bridge. Bring the tripod though, and turn off the flash if you're using a small tourist digital camera for a great shot.Getting around:We only used taxi services to get to and from SFO and to go out to nicer restaurants. The rest of the time we relied on Muni buses and Cable Cars. Make sure you get a good map of the routes and stops first and you'll be prepared to get anywhere. You'll find more tourists on the cable cars and locals on the buses. You'll also find that peak times (especially weekends) will mean full cable cars and longer waits to get on.Presidio and the Golden Gate:You can either drive or take the bus to the Presidio up to the Golden Gate. There are several photo spots to get some great photos so explore further than just the initial upper level and you'll find some really pretty areas.Palace of Fine Arts:The rotunda is really pretty as was the area surrounding it.

The website says the windows are sound-proof. Ours was definitely not. Our room, a standard Queen, was tiny. It felt like 150 sq. feet. There was no chair to read in and the bed took up most of the room. They offered to move us, but we just didn't want to bother with repacking &amp; unpacking. Summary: This is one hotel where I would definitely advise booking directly by phone with the front desk to make sure you get a room (ie not facing Powell or O'Farrell) that is noise-free, and that is a decent size (the ones with sitting areas are nice). They also have good package deals which include parking ($40 a night otherwise) and a continental breakfast. ANSWERNOTFOUND",knowledgeable staff,"(116, 135)",1,0.0,False

This was a real inconvenience since my wife always takes the complimentary bath products from hotels. I found it quite difficult to pry the dispenser thing off the wall to take home. The front desk was again very helpful though and provided me with a flathead screwdriver to get the job done. - no gym - you have to pay 15 bucks to use a gym in the area. Having to pay 15 bucks and leave the hotel to find the gym was enough to convince me that I didn't really feel like working out.What's the deal with the guests chilling in the lobby?- For some unknown reason guests seemed to be always hanging out in the lobby... eating pizzas, sitting in front of the fireplace, drinking beverages, talking to each other, and reading the coffee table books.- I guess this is one of those things that makes the hotel feel super &quot;boutiquey&quot;?- MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE:- the rooms are really small; or because they serve wine at 5:30 p.m. for free in the lobby and people mull around til midnight; or because the staff are very friendly helpful, polite and super nice.- OR : - travellers on a tight budget?- thought it was weird but then again I'm not into bonding with other hotel guests.Overall - a solid place to stay in San Francisco - all my complaints are pretty superficial - I'd go back and stay at the friendly Carlton.

We did and it was indeed very quiet (although the traffic didn't seem particularly heavy in the first place).All in all, an excellent stay over 4 nights and very good value for money.

After walking around San Francisco for 3 days I didn't find another hotel or location I preferred over the Orchard Garden Hotel. It just has that perfect balance of everything: nice clean tasteful boutique hotel that isn't too big nor too small, fantastic location that's close to transit (walkable from BART which was a huge plus for getting from and to the airport) and restaurants/cafes/bars that's not in an overly busy noisy area. I wouldn't have wanted to stay at any of the hotels within a block or 2 of Union Square. The only kind of traveler it wouldn't suit would be the kind that could only feel comfortable in a large chain hotel. One of the things we really appreciated was the free Wi-fi at our rooms. I think an earlier reviewer of this hotel suggested booking directly with the hotel to get better rooms. I think that reviewer may be correct. We booked about 2 1/2 months in advance through Expedia and we got the smallest room at possibly the worst location and we didn't pay any less than others. We checked in mid-afternoon so it wasn't like we got the last room available. Still, the room wasn't too small and we were happy because it was very clean and well-appointed. The bathroom was quite large with nice bath products. We were right beside the housekeeping room (anyone accessing the housekeeping room could be heard) and we had no view with little natural light but even still, it wasn't too bad at all - we didn't spend that much time in the room!As for the staff, they were great anytime we needed them. One night time concierge recommended a fantastic restaurant to us that was closeby: E &amp; O Trading Company. It was so good we went there twice! I recommend the lamb, the satay appetizer plate and the Russian River Pinot Noir! Reservations are recommended at least a few hours in advance if going on the weekend. Speaking of restaurants, we also ate at Trademark that was located on a lane way that was just north of Bush and west of Kearney (or was it east of Kearney?). That laneway had about 5 restaurants all in a row and it gets top marks for atmosphere. It reminded me of some dining experiences in France. Go there for pretty good food and fabulous atmosphere but then also go to E &amp; O for super tasty food. Another eatery that was good was across the street called Cafe de la Presse. It's good for brunch. For brunch, one of the daytime concierges recommended Sears and also a diner that started with &quot;L&quot; I can't remember but we went there and they were just touristy 50's American style diners which didn't suit us but I'm sure many people would like that type of place. A friend who lives outside San Francisco took us to the top of Macy's where The Cheesecake Company is located. It's a super busy restaurant with a vast menu. Even though it's in Macy's, it's open until late, accessible by a private elevator. We only had dessert there - cheesecake - so I can't comment on the food but the portions were large and it draws such a huge crowd it must be pretty good or it could be just another tourist attraction? The night time view off the terrace was the best part and I recommend it for the view.One tip if taking the Powell-Hyde cable car or any cable car for that matter. Don't try to get on at the first or last stop as there will be too many people queuing to hop on. You could wait over 40 minutes to get on as the conductor won't let too many people get on at once. Walk to the next stop where there will be much fewer people waiting. You'll get on right away! We were waiting at Powell and Market to get on where there were over 100 people forming a queue and we were told the wait would be about 45 minutes to get on. I discreetly asked the conductor if I could just walk to the next stop and he discreetly said yes. We did and got on right away!Oh another nice thing about the hotel...we left our luggage there after check out for an hour and when we retrieved our bags the doorman/porter told us the maid noticed I left my ipod on the dock in the room! I really appreciated their honesty. My husband would have been pretty upset with me if I had lost it!Anyway, my husband and I had a really great time in San Francisco (first visit for both of us). It's such a pretty city and even with the many tourists it attracts, it didn't feel too crowded or too busy.

Cold demeanor, no effort to remedy the situation. I then told him that I did not want to be charged the $50 per day incidental charge and to turn off my incidentals in the room as I would not be using them (ie.pay per view movies etc.) He then proceeded to charge me for them on top of the full amount for my week and then informed me that my card had been declined. When I asked why, he claimed that he had no idea (even though he did, as i know what he is looking at on his screen) and yet no apology. He corrected it and the card went thru. The next day I emailed the General Manager and voiced my disappointment. NO response. I guess the hotel that i work for is just a whole lot friendlier as we roll out the red carpet when a Hilton employee books at our hotel. It takes so little effort. I was not looking for a free ride, but simply an upgrade to my expensive stay. My advice: If you are a Hilton employee, DO NOT expect the special treatment at this hotel.

Mind you, they are friendly and willing to help, but often there are 3 standing right in front of the doors, sometimes one is on the staircase leading into the hotel, so it feels like you are sneaking past the Secret Service every time you enter the hotel. At some hotels the doormen quickly open the door and get out of your way but here they are usually in conversation and don't notice you until you are already past.Speaking of small, the rooms are on the small side as well, which is not too uncommon for an older property. Don't waste your time on a &quot;premium&quot; room as the extra square footage is mostly in a long hallway that isn't useable. On paper these rooms are larger but they end up feeling the same size.Premium rooms also have two televisions but unfortunately the Omni is one of those hotels that has upgraded to 'high-def&quot; TVs but not high-def programming. Everything on screen is stretched wide to fill the wider screen, which ends up making everything all distorted - all the actors look squat and fat. Some hotels allow you to set the TV back to the regular aspect ratio to fix this, but not the Omni. I guess they don't want the black bars on the sides of the screens. But the result is that they can claim to have high-quality TVs while the picture quality is actually worse than your average Holiday Inn.Premium rooms offer &quot;a courtyard view&quot;. Be aware that this means you will probably get some light through the window but the actual &quot;view will be of a wall, or large machinery. Definitely nothing you would take a picture of if you aren't an HVAC engineer.If they are busy don't gamble on a smoking room unless you really don't mind the smell. The Omni gets a lot of heavy smokers so those rooms truly reek.The hotel restaurant is okay, basic big-city hotel food (at very high prices) but nothing to get excited about.All in all, if you can book during a slow period when you can easily change rooms to find one more to your liking then the Omni is an acceptable downtown hotel. But when reservations are scarce you are better off at a more reliable property. ANSWERNOTFOUND","The hotel restaurant is okay, basic big-city hotel food","(2268, 2323)",2,0.2416666666666667,False

The hotel was a perfect launching off point for our adventures in San Francisco. The &quot;old world&quot; style and charm of the hotel made it a great place for a romantic long weekend. The staff was professional, the room very comfortable despite its modest size, and the location excellent. Having read other TripAdvisor reviews, we booked a &quot;Comfy Queen&quot; and requested an upper-level room if possible. Upon arrival, we were given room 709, back and away from the elevator on the hotel's top floor. It was nicely but simply decorated, with a TV monitor and DVD player in the room. The bed was on the soft side but quite comfortable. There was a small desk and dresser, and a nice leather chair in the corner. If we had wanted to, it would have been a nice quiet spot to spend a little time reading or something.The bathroom was among the more spacious in the hotel, I'm assuming, as others have commented on their tiny size. Ours was actually quite large, with a full bath and shower as well as a separate alcove for toilet, and enough space so both of us could get ready at the same time (although we had to swap space in front of the mirror/sink). The street noise was modest for a hotel in the downtown area of a major city. I slept with ear plugs, as I usually do when I travel, and had slept like a dream. My wife had no problems without her ear plugs, and she is a fairly light sleeper. Continental breakfast will not satisfy those who insist on Americanized breakfast rooms or expect a big meal, but we very much enjoyed the assortment of muffins, croissants, butter and jam, fresh fruit, coffee, and freshly squeezed orange juice. It was nice to have trays set out to carry food back to our room. One nice touch was the captain's chairs folded and waiting in our closet--extra seating on the fly!We enjoyed a complementary glass of wine in Fino, the bar/restaurant in the lobby, one evening. We did not dine there but the food looked and smelled great. We also appreciated having water, tea, and coffee available in the lobby at all times. Location is an easy (although uphill) walk from Union Square, right in the heart of the theater district and near Nob Hill. Convenient to virtually everything, including public transport (cable cars, MUNI, BART station, etc.). The Thai restaurant across the street (Ar Roi) is also quite good, by the way!

Many hotels will have nice lobbies, but have very ordinary rooms . The Omni had beautifully furnished luxurious rooms with every imaginable amenitiy. I would recommend it to anyone. As San Francisco is developing more and more to the east of Union Square, restaurants, shopping and attractions are near the Financial District location of the Omni. Plus, the California Cable Car line is right outside. We were in S.F. for the Chinese New Year Parade (a block away), Prom Dress Shopping, (5 min walk) and to attend an event at MoMA (10 minute walk). Nearby Belden Place offers some of San Franciscos best restaurants and a truly european bistro experience, that is entirely family friendly. We had dinner at Brindisi. Make reservations for weekends at any S.F. restaurant.. The hotel valet parking is $45 , high even for San Francisco. However, around the corner on Kearny is a 24 hour city parking lot with security. A bargain. If you join the Omni's &quot;club&quot; before your stay, you also get real pampering including morning coffee delivered to your door with the paper and free internet. We loved it!

The bathrooms were huge and contained everything you could possibly need. The bed was very comfortable and I was pleased that it did not have one of those dreadful feather mattresses.

Our bathroom faced the bed, so when you opened the door, it swung out about an inch from the side of the bed. I hated that, everyone could hear you pee. It also had a huge mirror on the door, so you could also SEE yourself pee. Not all the rooms are like that though. The bed was really comfy, the shower was very nice, and I loved loved LOVED the indoor pool and hot tub. Some gripes: I'm not sure if the in-room AC was working well, but my husband opened the window a bit (which was heavy as hell, I couldn't even lift it) so that kept the room nice and cool.

A little early, no? Keep the Privacy Please sign on your door unless you're a very early riser. All in all we had a great stay. One afternoon we walked to the Haight and caught a bus that dropped us off right in front of the hotel. And it was only a few blocks to Union Square. We even walked up through China town to City Lights and that wasn't too far either. But we're young outdoorsy walking people, so a few miles up big hills is nothing. Oh and I saw that some people didn't have such great luck with service, but we found everyone there to be extremely polite, even when we did have a snafu. One of the valets even stood in the middle of traffic so we could get into the far left lane to park in another lot. Their valet parking is $50 a day, so if you don't need a car, don't get one.

But the rooms are definitely hit or miss and it is quite random whether you will get a nice accommodation. On the plus side, the hotel is conveniently located downtown in the financial district. A bit far from the convention center or tourist destinations but great if you are in town for work. The staff is generally professional and helpful.The lobby is a bit small and it can be difficult to get past all the doormen to get to the desk. Mind you, they are friendly and willing to help, but often there are 3 standing right in front of the doors, sometimes one is on the staircase leading into the hotel, so it feels like you are sneaking past the Secret Service every time you enter the hotel. At some hotels the doormen quickly open the door and get out of your way but here they are usually in conversation and don't notice you until you are already past.Speaking of small, the rooms are on the small side as well, which is not too uncommon for an older property. Don't waste your time on a &quot;premium&quot; room as the extra square footage is mostly in a long hallway that isn't useable. On paper these rooms are larger but they end up feeling the same size.Premium rooms also have two televisions but unfortunately the Omni is one of those hotels that has upgraded to 'high-def&quot; TVs but not high-def programming. Everything on screen is stretched wide to fill the wider screen, which ends up making everything all distorted - all the actors look squat and fat. Some hotels allow you to set the TV back to the regular aspect ratio to fix this, but not the Omni. I guess they don't want the black bars on the sides of the screens. But the result is that they can claim to have high-quality TVs while the picture quality is actually worse than your average Holiday Inn.Premium rooms offer &quot;a courtyard view&quot;. Be aware that this means you will probably get some light through the window but the actual &quot;view will be of a wall, or large machinery. Definitely nothing you would take a picture of if you aren't an HVAC engineer.If they are busy don't gamble on a smoking room unless you really don't mind the smell. The Omni gets a lot of heavy smokers so those rooms truly reek.The hotel restaurant is okay, basic big-city hotel food (at very high prices) but nothing to get excited about.All in all, if you can book during a slow period when you can easily change rooms to find one more to your liking then the Omni is an acceptable downtown hotel.

It is more of a functional decor, but it has a pleasant and restful appearance.My only negative of this experience was dealing with Expedia in booking the hotel.

While researching places to stay, I was impressed with the prior reviews of this location as well as the fact that the GM personally responded to one of the only negative reviews posted. When we checked in, I was pleased with the exceptional 'customer service' we received. Without inquiry, we were provided with everything we could possibly need to navigate the city. We received a map of the city, local bus and trolley routes as well as first hand advice on which roads to take and places of interest. This type of service was routine during our visit. Interestingly enough, on one of the days we were visiting, the hotel management was replacing the room furniture. Let me tell you, it was a recipe for disaster when you consider that a large moving truck had to be parked in front of the hotel and the movers needed to complete this task in a three level hotel without disturbing guests. Personally, I was pleased with how the process went. The night before the move, the GM called us to advise what was going to happen and what we should expect. Although the movers were later than expected, I was completely satisfied with the manner in which our furniture swap was handled. The pictures currently available on this site appear to have the older furniture. The new furniture is much lighter in color.A few other notable benefits of this location include free parking (which is very impressive when you look at other hotels), an abundance of restaurants nearby and the ability to walk to locations such as the Fisherman's Wharf, Chinatown, Coit Tower, Lombard St, and Union Square. Please note that I indicated the ability to walk to these locations. A few are a good 2 mile + walk so please take that into consideration.

The first room we were assigned was on the fourth floor in the &quot;executive&quot; section, which costs slightly more. Don't bother.

This was sorted out really quickly as we got our bearings, worked out which way we needed to go, which way we needed to avoid and it turned out we were perfectly central. This lovely hotel is close to Union Square, all the shops, some lovely diners and bars and we actually even walked to fishermans wharf! It was also perfect for us to hit the ground running on our nightlife spots in America, with some of the cool nightclubs either within walking distance or a short taxi ride away(happily arranged by the lobby staff)Upon walking into the hotel you're met with a beautiful lobby with a classic design and plenty of space. The lobby staff were really helpful(especially Trey) and the reception staff were great too (Hom and Catherine especially). We were given a lovely room which met all our requests and our luggage was bought up to our room. To be honest, every single call I made downstairs was helpfully and decisively addressed. The room service was perfect, as was the restaurant where we had breakfast a few mornings.The hotel have a lovely evening 'drink and greet' session between 5-7 which is really nice to sit down, have a nice glass of wine and meet some of the other hotel guests (some of which we became quite friendly with). All our excursion ideas were assisted with, and we were also given assistance on some important calls we had to make for our excursions coming up in Vegas.Overall, a fantastic hotel, a great area, friendly(you're known by name), service was impeccable, and no enquiry or request couldn't be met.

Quite possibly one of the ugliest hotels in San Francisco, inside and out. The beds in our room were the worst I have slept on in years. We woke up with sore backs. The rooms were outdated. The floor was wet in one corner of our room. The heating/AC was very very loud. Other guests were very loud and staff did not quiet them. When we asked to switch rooms, our request was denied.We found used tissues on the floor of our room upon check-in.

There is no way it deserves a 4. The service was poor. The housekeeping was poor. The look and smell of the hotel was poor.

I compared it with MANY hotels and decided it was the best deal in a very safe location. It couldn't compare with the Westin St. Francis which promises to make your children feel welcome (wecome pkg, etc.). There is not a speck of personal service or attention here. I have always thought of the Westin as a nice hotel and this trip changed my mind. It falls under the Marriott. I will admit that I stayed in a Hampton Inn overnight on a road trip, once, and the room &amp; service was as nice or nicer than this. Our children are the quietest, most well-behaved children (per others) and they said they didn't feel welcome there and actually complained when we pulled into the Westin SF Airport on our last night. Luckily, we spent most of our time out of our room, because it was nothing special and not as nice as our home. The floors were also pretty dirty. The &quot;large&quot; windows were not as large as most hotels where I've stayed and the view was bad...and I am a Starwood member; which obviously means nothing. We also had 2 charges that were not ours but they took them off without question and very nicely...they were so obviously not our charges. Room service breakfast was also speedy and friendly. You also have to ask for toiletries. Typically, one would find a shower cap and body soap, but the rooms are only stocked with shampoo and hand soap - nothing more. The recession has hit the hotels! Our room did NOT have the heavenly beds either. They were not great actually; we know heavenly beds, and did have them following our stay when we went to the airport Westin, and the difference is discernable. I can't imagine we just got a bad room.Do not take restaurant recommendations from the concierge; do your own homework! We had a restaurant picked out and the concierge told us she knew of a better one. We should have been clued in when she gave us a post it to give the owner with his name and her full name on it. It wasn't very good and was filled with tourists. Not a single ethnic person in a Chinatown restaurant!?! It was not good and she was obviously getting a kickback from them. (I believe in the form of chinese takeout!) We were unhappy.All in all, if you can get a cheap room and do not want anyone to talk to you from the hotel, stay here. If you want to feel welcome in a strange city, look elsewhere. Maybe I'm spoiled, but it would have been nice for the kids to at least get a chocolate on their pillows.

After walking around San Francisco for 3 days I didn't find another hotel or location I preferred over the Orchard Garden Hotel. It just has that perfect balance of everything: nice clean tasteful boutique hotel that isn't too big nor too small, fantastic location that's close to transit (walkable from BART which was a huge plus for getting from and to the airport) and restaurants/cafes/bars that's not in an overly busy noisy area. I wouldn't have wanted to stay at any of the hotels within a block or 2 of Union Square. The only kind of traveler it wouldn't suit would be the kind that could only feel comfortable in a large chain hotel. One of the things we really appreciated was the free Wi-fi at our rooms. I think an earlier reviewer of this hotel suggested booking directly with the hotel to get better rooms. I think that reviewer may be correct. We booked about 2 1/2 months in advance through Expedia and we got the smallest room at possibly the worst location and we didn't pay any less than others. We checked in mid-afternoon so it wasn't like we got the last room available. Still, the room wasn't too small and we were happy because it was very clean and well-appointed. The bathroom was quite large with nice bath products. We were right beside the housekeeping room (anyone accessing the housekeeping room could be heard) and we had no view with little natural light but even still, it wasn't too bad at all - we didn't spend that much time in the room!As for the staff, they were great anytime we needed them. One night time concierge recommended a fantastic restaurant to us that was closeby: E &amp; O Trading Company. It was so good we went there twice! I recommend the lamb, the satay appetizer plate and the Russian River Pinot Noir! Reservations are recommended at least a few hours in advance if going on the weekend. Speaking of restaurants, we also ate at Trademark that was located on a lane way that was just north of Bush and west of Kearney (or was it east of Kearney?). That laneway had about 5 restaurants all in a row and it gets top marks for atmosphere. It reminded me of some dining experiences in France. Go there for pretty good food and fabulous atmosphere but then also go to E &amp; O for super tasty food. Another eatery that was good was across the street called Cafe de la Presse. It's good for brunch. For brunch, one of the daytime concierges recommended Sears and also a diner that started with &quot;L&quot; I can't remember but we went there and they were just touristy 50's American style diners which didn't suit us but I'm sure many people would like that type of place. A friend who lives outside San Francisco took us to the top of Macy's where The Cheesecake Company is located. It's a super busy restaurant with a vast menu. Even though it's in Macy's, it's open until late, accessible by a private elevator. We only had dessert there - cheesecake - so I can't comment on the food but the portions were large and it draws such a huge crowd it must be pretty good or it could be just another tourist attraction? The night time view off the terrace was the best part and I recommend it for the view.One tip if taking the Powell-Hyde cable car or any cable car for that matter. Don't try to get on at the first or last stop as there will be too many people queuing to hop on. You could wait over 40 minutes to get on as the conductor won't let too many people get on at once. Walk to the next stop where there will be much fewer people waiting. You'll get on right away! We were waiting at Powell and Market to get on where there were over 100 people forming a queue and we were told the wait would be about 45 minutes to get on. I discreetly asked the conductor if I could just walk to the next stop and he discreetly said yes. We did and got on right away!Oh another nice thing about the hotel...we left our luggage there after check out for an hour and when we retrieved our bags the doorman/porter told us the maid noticed I left my ipod on the dock in the room! I really appreciated their honesty. My husband would have been pretty upset with me if I had lost it!Anyway, my husband and I had a really great time in San Francisco (first visit for both of us). It's such a pretty city and even with the many tourists it attracts, it didn't feel too crowded or too busy.

It's right in the middle of some great shopping! Overall we enjoyed our stay with a few little hiccups along the way.The minor issues: 1. The hair dryer in the room was fried and we called the front desk to get a replacement. It never came. We had to call a second time before we got a replacement. The good thing is that at least on the second call we got a response within 15 minutes.2. We cancelled a wake-up call but they called anyway - twice. My husband was there on a conference and I chose to sleep late one morning but the wake-up call he cancelled came anyway and woke me up at 4:30am.The major issue:My husband was in the room taking a break from his conference and I was in the shower. We had the privacy sign out on the door and the privacy lock engaged. The mini-bar attendant (a man) took the sign off the door and wedged it on the wall behind our room number. He knocked briefly and then tried to come right on in. The lock prevented the door from opening more than 4 inches. Initially I was upset because if the privacy sign is out it generally means you don't want to be disturbed. The second reason I was upset was that if my husband wasn't in the room at the time and I had forgotten to engage the privacy lock, ... fill in the blanks. Since the shower is right next to the hotel door you can clearly hear it outside in the hall. My only assumption is that either the employee was trying to walk in on something or he simply disregards people's privacy.In my opinion I think this is a serious security concern. When we discussed it with a member of management, she seemed concerned and said she'd speak to the staff and security about the incident.What's interesting is that between the first phone call to the manager and the time I left the room an hour later, it happened a second time. I happened to be at the door about to go out and saw him through the peep hole. He removed the privacy sign from the door and wedged it on the wall again and then knocked. At least this time he didn't try to enter our room.Just be aware of this when thinking of booking your room there. The main lesson to learn is to always put the privacy sign out and to engage the privacy lock when you don't want anyone barging in. This could have happened at any hotel room in the world so take this lesson with you anywhere you choose to stay.Now for the fun stuff:Grand Views lounge on the 36th floor is worth the view but you'll get sticker shock when ordering any drinks. A plain martini is $12 and it had too much vermouth in it. I couldn't finish it because it was horrible but you won't go wrong with wine or beer. This is a great place to go for a quick cup of coffee to enjoy the view but there are better places to get a drink.Perry's Downtown:This place makes a great burger and is a good place to go for drinks or a good burger and a beer. It's about 2 1/2 blocks away from the Hyatt. It's a good lunch place and a good casual dinner place and is reasonable on the wallet.Steps of Rome Trattoria:North BeachThis is the best Italian food!! I had the Gnocchi alla Serentia and it was fantastic! The place doesn't look like much but the people are friendly and the food is wonderful!Pizza Chicago:Ghiradelli SquareGreat pizza joint in a casual atmosphere. Reasonable and worth every penny!La Suite:On Brannan near the Bay BridgeAmazing french food!!! It's in a higher price range but the food is awesome! The bar is trendy, the drinks very generous and the staff is friendly.Hawthorn Lane:I'm not sure where it's located but the food and atmosphere were amazing. This is among the highest priced restaurants in the city but if you love good food and excellent service this is the place for you. I had the lobster - mmm mmm!Alcatraz evening tour:Ok, so I'm not into cheezy tourist stuff but I enjoyed this tour. If for nothing else, go for the views of the city. It's a neat piece of history to check out and has incredible views of the city, the Golden Gate, Angel Island and the Bay Bridge. Bring the tripod though, and turn off the flash if you're using a small tourist digital camera for a great shot.Getting around:We only used taxi services to get to and from SFO and to go out to nicer restaurants. The rest of the time we relied on Muni buses and Cable Cars. Make sure you get a good map of the routes and stops first and you'll be prepared to get anywhere. You'll find more tourists on the cable cars and locals on the buses. You'll also find that peak times (especially weekends) will mean full cable cars and longer waits to get on.Presidio and the Golden Gate:You can either drive or take the bus to the Presidio up to the Golden Gate. There are several photo spots to get some great photos so explore further than just the initial upper level and you'll find some really pretty areas.Palace of Fine Arts:The rotunda is really pretty as was the area surrounding it.

Coming from a small city to a large area like San Francisco, we were stepping outside our comfort zone so one of our main concerns was finding a safe place to stay in a safe neighborhood. A second concern was finding a reasonably priced hotel which would allow us to spend our extra cash on tours, attractions, restaurants - in short, on experiencing the city. The Castle Inn exceeded our expectations in both areas. We felt safe, and we were able to stay four days in a clean, comfortable, reasonably priced hotel. We walked EVERYWHERE from this hotel - Fisherman's Wharf, Chinatown, the Trans America Building, Coit Tower, Lombard Street, the Palace of Fine Arts, Fort Point, and the Golden Gate. Granted, some of these were rather long hikes, but we were still so pleased not to have to worry about transportation and really experience the city on foot.We enjoyed meeting and talking to Arlene, Marshall, and Varsa. In particular, we appreciate the extra work that Varsa went to in booking us a deluxe city tour with Alcatraz, and in booking us a shuttle back to the airport at the conclusion of our stay.We absolutely intend to visit San Francisco again, and we'll be booking at the Castle Inn for sure.

The decor is hip and interesting and the service from all staff is great and friendly. Also, the place is totally non-smoking, which is absolutely terrific. The location is great, close to Union Square, Financial District and SoMa.I had read on Trip Advisor about the problems with valet parking so I avoided it by parking in one of the several parking garages in the neighborhood with in and out privelages. The price of this was about $28 a day as compared to $35 a day with the Hotel Diva valet....and boy was I glad. Rarely did I pass through the lobby in 5 days and not see someone waiting anxiously for the valet to return with their car from several blocks away. Eventually this became a point of humor with my wife and I as we always overheard &quot;So how long is this going to take, we've been waiting 20 minutes?&quot; Do yourself a favor, and park your car yourself. If you don't plan on driving at all there are lots of cheaper options including the 5th &amp; Mission parking garage, which is less than a 10 minute walk away and only costs $23/day.Otherwise, this place is a great jem, right in the heart of it all.

But THIS review is more about what they put us through AFTERWARDS then during....(not putting any names in this review, but now, we knew that entire hierarchy by name, as you will later see)Our stay was starting on August 11th. My two friends and I arrive after our flight at 11AM, so we decide to drop off our bags in the lobby and go around town before check-in at 3PM. We get to the lobby, and my friend, who has major asthma, asked if we could get a peek at one of the rooms. The woman at the front desk was kind enough to give us a key to take a look. We opened the door, and the smell of mold hit us in the face like a brick. My friend was nervous, because she didn't think she'd be able to handle the smell, but we decided to wait to see if the room they gave us was the same, or if this was just a fluke.3PM comes, and we check in, and the room that they gave us is the same exact way. My friend already starts to feel a slight reaction, so we go to the lobby to see about a switch. According to the same rude and horrible Indian guy that everyone else describes working there, there are no other rooms available. I say that she cannot stay in that room because of her condition, and he says that his supervisor will be in in a half hour, if we want to talk to him. I said that we'll wait to ask about a refund, and suddenly, he had another room for us to check out. THAT room, however, was even worse! The door didn't lock fully, a light didn't work, the mold smell was even worse, and there was what seemed to be cat hair all over the single chair and the countertops. Now, the fun starts:We go back downstairs, and we say that we absolutely cannot stay there, and we want a refund. Apparently, we booked the non-refundable rate, the money was already taken out and there was nothing we could do about it. I said that we'd wait for his supervisor, and suddenly, he wasn't coming in anymore that night. He wasn't answering his phone, and we had to call back the next day between 9AM and 1PM. (Obviously, with the line of people out the door still waiting to check in with the horrible service, they didn't want any problems in the lobby) We said fine, and spent the rest of our first day in San Francisco looking for another hotel.Tthe next day, the woman who answered the lobby phone said that the supervisor DID come in about an hour after we left, and got off at 8:30 in the morning, RIGHT BEFORE we were supposed to call. I asked when he was going to be in again...she said 3:00. I asked for the manager's number. She gave me a different phone number and a different name, and asked me to explain the situation to her. I did, and she suddenly said that the supervisor wasn't coming in anymore today because he was tired, and I don't have to call the manager, but to deal with the supervisor, who will be in TOMORROW between 10 and 2. I called back at 3, and again, the Indian guy answered, and said the supervisor was around, but it was hard for him to get to a phone, and he'll do his best, but he doesn't know if he'll be able to talk. To make a long story longer, the supervisor never called back. We called the manager several times, and we are STILL being given the run around to get a refund for our non-stay. This hotel is the worst experience I have EVER had in ANY hotel. It should be closed down immediately, people should not be subjected to it, and the people at the front desk and in charge should never be allowed to work in a hotel again. I spent a total of about 20 minutes in this place, and the stress and trouble they are causing us now to get a refund for a time we didn't spend there is awful (especially since it's not like we didn't show up....we did, and they expect to just take our money for nothing, because WE have some sort of decency and hope to sleep comfortably without bed bugs, mold, and sickness).Please avoid this hotel at all costs....I would give it negative stars if possible......

I was impressed because usually pillows are way too puffy, big, and uncomfortable in most hotels. We stayed on the 6th floor and had a nice partial view of the Bay Bridge. The staff was very friendly and accommodating, and the concierge was really helpful during the entire 3 night stay. The bathroom was kind of small for this type of room in my opinion, but it was nice and the shower pressure was great and the water was hot. The lobby is pretty small and nothing too impressive, but decent enough. We also liked the location--just a few blocks from BART, and easy to catch public transportation or walk to other areas. We really enjoyed our stay here but for the following which happened twice!Our first night there after getting up at about 1:30 am to use the restroom, the guest next door was talking and laughing on her phone extremely loud. We happened to have a room with a partition, which could open up to a room next door (in those cases where you get 2 adjoining rooms). To her, it probably didn't seem loud, but it felt like she was in our room and it was really hard to get back to sleep. We almost moved to a new room the next night--the hotel was very accommodating with this request--but we figured it was just a chance of bad luck, and if it happened again we could call down and complain and the problem would be solved immediately. We should have moved!! The next night was fine. On the third night, we went to bed around 11 pm and were exhausted. To my surprise, at 2 AM, while in a DEEP sleep, I was suddenly awakened by these REALLY loud women speaking a foreign language and screaming/laughing. However, it wasn't even coming from the partition side (which is why the first night I figured we could hear the one lady) but on the other side of our room! The ladies were being really obnoxious and loud and it was unacceptable, so we called down to complain and security was sent up. The voices came down, but you could still hear people talking, even though they were not talking loud. I've never experienced that in any other hotel, unless people are in the hallway or someone is having a raging party next door. The next day I was really tired and disappointed that I didn't get a good's night sleep before traveling home.

We've stayed at this W property around 5 times now.When greeted at the front desk upon arrival, the clerks are always pleasant, but this time there were probably 4 other groups of people checking in at the same time we were (around 4 p.m. on a Friday). The only problem is that everyone standing near the front desk heard every bit of everyone else's business, including room numbers and other stuff. It was kind of uncomfortable, and I'm used to a more professional check-in environment at the W.Upon getting to our room, we had an upper floor room designated for a bay view. Well, the bay view is disappearing fast with new big buildings being built in downtown San Francisco. One high-rise in particular has blocked a huge section of the view now so it's not the same as it used to be if you haven't been there for awhile. A couple of years ago, we had the &quot;city view,&quot; which is nice, especially during the holidays when the nearby park close to the Metreon is lit.The rooms are always nice and the W hotels always have a signature smell inside, which is wonderful. I have no idea what fragrance they use (and I was told by one of the clerks in the Bliss Spa on site that it is indeed a signature scent that is not sold anywhere on the property).This was the first time we ever noticed thin walls between rooms at the W. Either the rooms next to ours in the past were unoccupied or the people were extremely quiet. This time, we could hear actual conversations in the room next to ours and it was uncomfortable to say the least. One bad thing (or good, depending on how you look at it) is that the hotel is often a &quot;party&quot; type hotel, where you have a number of 20somethings who can be very noisy. Now that we're in our late 30s, it's beginning to get kind of annoying. :-) We heard a lot of door slamming and a lot of loud laughing in the halls at times like 3 a.m. and stuff like that.The Bliss Spa on site was very nice and the staff there was excellent... helpful and friendly and I'd give them an A plus.Some drawbacks are the ridiculous prices for the honor bar in the room. A $5 Reese's peanut butter cup? Are they kidding? And there are no soda machines anywhere on the property. We called their &quot;whatever whenever&quot; number at the hotel and were told that we could order room service if we wanted a pepsi or something similar. Ugh. We ordered breakfast from room service one morning and it was pretty standard fare... good but certainly not outstanding or unique in any way.Overall, it's a very nice hotel and you can't beat the location. The rooms could use some tweaking though. There wasn't even a sleep timer on the TV, and it wouldn't hurt the W to begin investing in plasma TVs. They want to be considered upscale yet they stick with older television sets, which is kind of strange. Their bathrooms are well-designed and very nice. We will probably stay at the W again but it's not quite as fine of a property as it used to be a few years ago. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3088, 3102)",5,0.0,False

We had booked the room directly through their website, and secured a 'hot dates' rate of $99 per night. We planned to stay in San Franscico for 5 nights as the first leg of our 2-week California stay, so we definitely wanted something not too pricey but hopefully nice. The Serrano definitely fit this criteria. The lobby area of the hotel is interesting &amp; tasteful; I loved the decor of this area (sort of chic vintage Morroccan...perhaps a bit Casablanca-like &amp; old Hollywood), with all sorts of interesting things to look at. The bedrooms had a similar theme and were really quite lovely. Ours was on the fifth floor and didn't have a great view (basically the side of a concrete building) and the room wasn't terribly large, but we didn't spend much time there anyways. Contrary to what other reviews have mentioned, our bathroom was actually quite spacious, although the shelving for toiletries is a little limited (they provided Aveda toiletries, by the way, which was very nice). The tub was fairly deep although I was disappointed because it was a little short for my long legs (I am 5'10&quot;)!! The linens on the bed were lovely, I found the bed very comfortable, there was a spacious walk-in closet, terry cloth robes &amp; a huge mirror on the wall by the bed. Although we didn't buy anything (the hotel is less than a block away from a Walgreens), there was a nice selection in the mini-bar.The location of the hotel is actually quite good. Some people have complained about homeless and feeling unsafe, but I think this is a bit ridiculous. This hotel is in a very busy, bustling area of the city, full of shops and restaurants, so as long as you don't stray too far south (and you should be able to tell immediately when you have done so because things start to get shady), you'll be fine. There are always lots of people around, even at night. For breakfast, I would recommend two places: David's Delicatessen (around the corner) and the Taylor St. Coffee Shop (just down the block.) David's is a Jewish deli with 1950's style diner seating, and cooks up a mean set of Fresh Apple Pancakes and Scrambled Eggs with lox...I am getting hungry just thinking about it! But this place is a bit pricey; my boyfriend ate here several mornings with our bill totalling over $30. More reasonably priced (we saved about $10 each time we ate here) is the Taylor St. Coffee Shop. This place is smaller but very friendly. The kitchen is in the open at the front of the restaurant and every member of staff thanked us as we left each morning. My favorite was a super yummy entre of eggs with guacamole, bacon bits, tomato and hashbrowns for $6.99 - great value. Also serve a fantastic fresh OJ. This place has a retro feel with photos of Marilyn, James Dean &amp; other classic stars adorning the walls. But back to the Serrano - I think the excellent staff and the attention to customer service is one of the biggest ways this hotel is a standout. We were ALWAYS greeted by a member of staff upon entering the hotel, and even the staff taking luggage up or downstairs on the elevator were friendly enough to say hello and strike up short conversations. We missed the wine tasting one evening by a few minutes and the concierge overseeing it (didn't catch his name) was nice enough to bring us up our own bottle!!!

There was a good selection to get your day started - juice, coffee, tea, milk, cereals, toast, bagels, yogurt, bananas, eggs (either scrambled or omlette which seemed to be prepacked and microwaved), bacon and/or sausage. The hotel was full on the weekend and the breakfast bar was quite busy at times. I felt the hotel did a great job of refilling things and we never had to wait long for anything. We always also managed to find a table for our group of 4.There were a couple of minor things we noted. While the hotel looked great, it is very basic and didn't have any nice little &quot;extras&quot;. I thought it would have been nice to have coffee/tea service in the lobby area throughout the day, not just until 9:30 am - we've had this at other Holiday Inn Express hotels and basic type hotels such as Quality Inns, etc. Some aspects of service could have been a little better as well. I wanted to have a tea in my room early one evening. I had forgot to take a milk back up to the room in the morning - tea with powdered whitener just isn't that great. I had hoped that the front desk could get me a milk - the breakfast room was just a few steps away - but they were unable to help as their &quot;house man&quot; was not on duty. While I was waiting at the front desk an older man approached and indicated that they had just returned from their day out and their room hadn't been cleaned. The gentleman at the front desk indicated that he &quot;couldn't understand how that could happen, it had never happened before&quot;. He asked the guest if he was sure he didn't leave his Do Not Disturb sign on the door. The guest replied he was sure he hadn't. The front desk clerk then proceeded to tell the gentlemant there was nothing he could for him as the cleaning staff were gone for the day and again, the house man was not in. The front desk clerk didn't offer anything to the guest for the inconvenience - he just restated he couldn't understand how that could happen. To me, surely someone could have gone up and emptied the garbages and at least gave them clean towels? Also, don't forget that parking is very expensive, as is pretty standard with wharf area hotels. We didn't have a vechicle but noticed that the valet parking was over $40 per night.

We reserved a &quot;deluxe king corner guest room&quot;, which was on the 7th floor. Compared to the last SF hotel I stayed at (Hotel Triton), the room was *huge*. The Joie De Vivre/Hotel Adagio website gave a pretty accurate preview and 360 degree virtual tours of what we could expect with respect to our room, the lobby, etc. Our bathroom was oddly shaped, but was also ginormous compared to what you might expect from an older property. (We theorized our room--which was not a suite--was actually two tiny rooms remodeled into a larger one. Again, this isn't a complaint.) If you're an Aveda user, you'll like the complementary shampoo and soap. ;-) The lobby was very chic and modern, spacious, really quiet, and the staff was friendly enough. PROS*The hotel is super-convenient to Union Square, the fancy new Westfield SF Ctr. with a brand new Bloomingdale's, ritzy food court, and the world famous Nordstrom with the curving escalator. Macy's, Saks Fifth Ave., and Neiman Marcus are only a few blocks away as well.*The Powell St. BART/MUNI station is probably a 7-minute walk to/from the Adagio. This was key for us because we could board the cable cars at Powell St., or take public transportation to the Castro or the Mission District (via BART) or the new DeYoung Museum in Golden Gate Park (via MUNI).*There's FREE WI-FI in the lobby, and FREE internet in the hotel rooms. (They'll even lend you an ethernet cable if you don't have one!) Since paying for internet connectivity at the other chain 4-star hotels annoys me to no end, I am so appreciative of the Adagio's free internet. Additionally, if you didn't bring a laptop, there are 3-4 computer terminals in the &quot;business center&quot; (really a quiet hallway behind the lobby) which are free for guests to use.*My boyfriend and I didn't take advantage of them, but the Adagio offers several complementary walking tours of SF with fun themes like &quot;hidden local cafes and breakfast spots,&quot; &quot;gay SF&quot;, a &quot;foodie tour,&quot; etc.*The entire property is non-smoking. Hooray. CONS*Not really a criticism of the hotel, but SF's homeless problem is well-documented. The Adagio is in the &quot;Theater District&quot; (is this a bona fide SF neighborhood, or the tourism board's spin?), which is only a couple blocks from Union Square--but also only a couple blocks from the Tenderloin. We never felt uncomfortable (we're from Seattle, and there's a noticeable homeless presence there too), but really--if you're staying in the city's most popular tourist destination, you should expect that panhandlers will naturally congregate in that area as well. MY TIPS*If you're a light packer, you can take Air BART/BART from Oakland to the Powell St. BART/MUNI station for less than $10 one way. Just be prepared to walk a few generous blocks to/from the hotel. (Believe me, it's an invigorating walk, not the Bataan Death March. Really.)*The Adagio offers free internet connectivity, both wired and wireless. We like free.*There's complementary tea and coffee in the lobby, or you can go a block and a half east to the Starbucks located directly next to the Hotel Diva. There's a Walgreen's less than a block from the hotel.*In the aformentioned Westfield SF Ctr., there's the *world's ritziest food court*, with a reasonably priced food (for SF) and a Beard Papa's (a Japanese chain selling yummy creme puffs), as well as a fancy-schmancy Bristol Farms supermarket.*We bought a 3-day MUNI &quot;passport&quot;, which costs $18 and gives unlimited MUNI transport. If you factor that round-trip fare on the cable cars = $10, you're already ahead. Also, my pass was good for $2 at the DeYoung Museum.In short, the Adagio was a very clean, spacious, and--dare I say--hip hotel, without much attitude.

Since we'd leave the room at 9 a.m. and not return until 10 p.m., the price was right for this type of accomodation.

I requested a North facing room because these rooms have heavenly views of the San Francisco Bay, Alcatraz and Coit tower. We had booked three rooms, and no one received a North-facing room. On the second night we all obtained North facing rooms, however these were all on lower levels (i.e. floor 27 and lower). This wasn't a problem for us, as we still had Regency club access and were still high enough to have a lovely view. The rooms were average at best. Nothing that special, except that the beds were fantastic. Small TV in bathroom was a nice perk.REGENCY CLUB: If you have the extra $$$, by all means upgrade to the Regency club. There is breakfast every morning (i.e. croissants, bagels, cereal, TONS of fresh fruit, cheese, ham, juice, coffee etc) and a cocktail hour from 4-7 pm which includes hot appetizers, dips, sodas (wine/spirits $4.00/each). But the real reason to join the regency club is: the view fantastic overlooking Coit Tower, the Bay. Who wouldn't want to wake up to this every morning?!

San Francisco was lovely and the people everywhere were very friendly, possibly a little too much!! However, the hotel is in desperate need of a make over and looks absolutly awful from the outside. Our room was street facing which subsequently meant that we got absolutly no sleep for the week that we were there. Unless you enjoy the constant horn pressing, the bizarre bin emptying at 3am and the odd screaming match between taxi drivers, who have cut each other up. You, too will end up sleep deprived.

After walking around San Francisco for 3 days I didn't find another hotel or location I preferred over the Orchard Garden Hotel. It just has that perfect balance of everything: nice clean tasteful boutique hotel that isn't too big nor too small, fantastic location that's close to transit (walkable from BART which was a huge plus for getting from and to the airport) and restaurants/cafes/bars that's not in an overly busy noisy area. I wouldn't have wanted to stay at any of the hotels within a block or 2 of Union Square. The only kind of traveler it wouldn't suit would be the kind that could only feel comfortable in a large chain hotel. One of the things we really appreciated was the free Wi-fi at our rooms. I think an earlier reviewer of this hotel suggested booking directly with the hotel to get better rooms. I think that reviewer may be correct. We booked about 2 1/2 months in advance through Expedia and we got the smallest room at possibly the worst location and we didn't pay any less than others. We checked in mid-afternoon so it wasn't like we got the last room available. Still, the room wasn't too small and we were happy because it was very clean and well-appointed. The bathroom was quite large with nice bath products. We were right beside the housekeeping room (anyone accessing the housekeeping room could be heard) and we had no view with little natural light but even still, it wasn't too bad at all - we didn't spend that much time in the room!As for the staff, they were great anytime we needed them. One night time concierge recommended a fantastic restaurant to us that was closeby: E &amp; O Trading Company. It was so good we went there twice! I recommend the lamb, the satay appetizer plate and the Russian River Pinot Noir! Reservations are recommended at least a few hours in advance if going on the weekend. Speaking of restaurants, we also ate at Trademark that was located on a lane way that was just north of Bush and west of Kearney (or was it east of Kearney?). That laneway had about 5 restaurants all in a row and it gets top marks for atmosphere. It reminded me of some dining experiences in France. Go there for pretty good food and fabulous atmosphere but then also go to E &amp; O for super tasty food. Another eatery that was good was across the street called Cafe de la Presse. It's good for brunch. For brunch, one of the daytime concierges recommended Sears and also a diner that started with &quot;L&quot; I can't remember but we went there and they were just touristy 50's American style diners which didn't suit us but I'm sure many people would like that type of place. A friend who lives outside San Francisco took us to the top of Macy's where The Cheesecake Company is located. It's a super busy restaurant with a vast menu. Even though it's in Macy's, it's open until late, accessible by a private elevator. We only had dessert there - cheesecake - so I can't comment on the food but the portions were large and it draws such a huge crowd it must be pretty good or it could be just another tourist attraction? The night time view off the terrace was the best part and I recommend it for the view.One tip if taking the Powell-Hyde cable car or any cable car for that matter. Don't try to get on at the first or last stop as there will be too many people queuing to hop on. You could wait over 40 minutes to get on as the conductor won't let too many people get on at once. Walk to the next stop where there will be much fewer people waiting. You'll get on right away! We were waiting at Powell and Market to get on where there were over 100 people forming a queue and we were told the wait would be about 45 minutes to get on. I discreetly asked the conductor if I could just walk to the next stop and he discreetly said yes. We did and got on right away!Oh another nice thing about the hotel...we left our luggage there after check out for an hour and when we retrieved our bags the doorman/porter told us the maid noticed I left my ipod on the dock in the room! I really appreciated their honesty. My husband would have been pretty upset with me if I had lost it!Anyway, my husband and I had a really great time in San Francisco (first visit for both of us). It's such a pretty city and even with the many tourists it attracts, it didn't feel too crowded or too busy.

Throughout our week there, they were, without exception, friendly, helpful and down to earth, calling us by name all week. I found myself tipping well and often. The hotel was built in 1926 by C.P Huntington, one of the &quot;Big 4&quot; railroad tycoons along with Hopkins, Stanford and Crocker. Having spent some of my career at Mr. Huntington's shipyard in Virginia, the choice was a natural for me. I was not disappointed. The hotel is historic, but updated in most respects. Smaller than the other Nob Hill hotels, the lobby is intimate and dining choices are limited to the &quot;Big Four&quot; Restaurant, highly rated by Zagat. Our dinner there was both very good and expensive...a &quot;special occasion&quot; venue unless on expense account. We also followed the doorman's recommendation of the Nob Hill Cafe, a quick 2 block (horizontal!) walk. Excellent choice with good food and reasonable prices. We booked one of the standard rooms through Expedia for $121 per night...a bargain by any standard. The King bed was comfortable and the room was immaculate. The bathroom looked newly renovated with wall to wall mirrors and a window that could be opened to let in the bay breezes. A caffeine addict, I was annoyed that there was no in-room coffee maker. Free coffee is available in the lobby only from 5-7 am...ok for the businessman, but not if you're on vacation. If you miss the deadline, it's $3 for an 8 oz paper cup in the restaurant. Internet access is $9.95 a day, ending at 1 pm. No free WiFi as I have become accustomed to. Another minor annoyance is the lack of ice machines. You have to call the bellman and have it delivered.. The minibar was empty, but I don't use those anyway...it was handy for storing leftovers. Another unexpected bonus...the Huntington has an agreement with Hertz rental car...your paperwork can be completed by the concierge and faxed to Hertz. And for an additional $20, you car will be waiting at the front door of the hotel and when returning, just hand the key to the doorman and walk in. Just make your reservation ahead of time to ensure there's a car available. Conveniently located on the cable car line ($5 per person), we found it more convenient to take a cab everywhere...$8 to Fisherman's Wharf and $10 to the Museum. The cabs are safe and the drivers the friendliest I have found. All in all, we were very pleased with our stay and left feeling like friends rather than customers...everyone was so helpful from the front desk to the doorman to the housekeeper.

Bedding was adequately comfortable, but not &quot;ahhhh.&quot; My bathroom had shower beginning to show signs of wear (cracking tiles), but tile and grout were perfectly clean. The 4th floor rooms open onto what I call a &quot;hanging courtyard&quot; running the length of the building, which is very nice for sitting with coffee in the morning. I was told that the upper floors (where others from our group stayed) had great views. The hotel is a good value for the price. There are several places to eat nearby on Market Street, including a &quot;mom and pop&quot; style diner, Burger King, and a coffee place. To sum up, if you want a good, functional, convenient hotel that's nicer than a motel, this is the place. If you want a nice, pampering experience, then you need to splurge somewhere else.

We booked it based on TripAdvisor reviews. I'm very glad I found this hotel here because the only way to book is directly through the hotel (no Orbitz, hotels.com, etc). The hotel is very easy to get to and is in a great neighborhood. I was a little worried that there might not be much around the hotel since it's not near Union Square or Fisherman's Wharf, but there's actually quite a few little shops and at least 30 restaurants within a 2 block radius of the hotel. The first night we were there, we walked to the bay - it was a quick 1/4-1/2 mile walk - which was a great way to look at all the million-dollar houses in the area (what beautiful architecture!) It's an upscale neighborhood and I always felt safe outside.There are several bus stops within 2-3 blocks. We used the bus system the entire time we were there - it's definitely the easiest way to get around. We did get a rental car, but only used it to get to/from the airport and for a trip to Muir Woods one day. The hotel does have free parking.Our room was cleaned very well every day. We didn't have any interaction with hotel staff other than check-in and check-out. I recommend bringing a key chain because all they give you is a loose key.We did not have any problem with noise, however my husband often falls asleep with the TV on, so the two of us are probably just used to some noise. Our room was on the first floor facing Steiner street (I've attached a photo taken from our window, facing the corner of Steiner and Lombard).Things that didn't add or take away from our stay, but I would recommend to the hotel management:- The pictures on the website seriously need to be updated. The ugly wallpaper in those pictures is no longer in the rooms. Our room was much more pleasant looking in person than in the website pictures.- It would've been nice to have a comfy chair or small couch in the corner of our room. The bay window is lovely, but there's just this big empty space next to it. Our room had a single king bed, so the double bed rooms probably fill this space better.- I wouldn't book my stay on the website because it does not have a secure server (http vs. https).- When I went to check out at 5:30am, no one was at the front desk. After a few minutes, I thought I heard someone rustling in back, so I called out &quot;Hello??&quot; That did the trick. :o) I think if employees are going to hang out in back during slow times, a bell on the door or on the desk would be an easy solution.We ate at many of the restaurants close to our hotel and enjoyed them all:- Country Sky Chinese (across Steiner street) - We loved this place! Our food was fantastic and the staff was incredibly sweet.- Barney's Gourmet Hamburgers (next door on Steiner) - Food was good, but the wait was long (and the restaurant wasn't full). I'd still recommend this place - it seems as though the entire town is short on wait staff, and everyone works very hard.- Izzy's Steak and Chops (across Steiner street) - This was a treat. I had Swordfish and just loved it, my husband had lamb and said it was good, but not the best he'd had. This was the most expensive place we visited.- Mel's Diner (across Lombard street) - This is a 50's style, jukebox diner. Food was good, milkshakes were great. We enjoyed our meal, but it didn't really make me think of &quot;San Francisco&quot;.- Squat and Gobble (on Chestnut, about a 2 block walk from the hotel) - We had lunch here and it was fantastic. Lots of salads and crepes.- Korean BBQ (I can't remember the actual name of the restaurant, but it's right next to the hotel on Steiner street) - We got take-out one night and ate it in our hotel room. My husband really enjoyed this, but it was the first time either of us had eaten Korean food, so I can't tell you how authentic it was.

This made me worry about the rest of the room's cleanliness. We had only one robe, and no wash clothes. Housecleaning had to bring them up for us at our request apologizing that they just got out of the dryer, and the robe looked like it just came out of the dryer all wrinkly. There was one tea bag (just a regular store brand) and the floor didn't look like it had been vacuumed in a while. We complained and got a room in the adjoining building with no balcony, though the room was about the same size. That night a group in the hotel decided to party on their balcony at 3:00 in the morning and were shouting down to the courtyard which echoed into our room. It was the most obnoxious night I've had in a hotel. The front desk was responsive once we called them and the &quot;guests&quot; went back into their room, though I'm sure the neighboring room was not too happy since we were able to hear EVERYTHING next door to us.

I've stayed in the Four Seasons and the Ritz and many other hotels in SF. Four Seasons may have better rooms in terms of architecture and the modern facility, but the location is not desirable (too many homeless wandered nearby and didn't feel safe at night). Nothing stands out at the Ritz; it has no view and its location is mediocre; services were good but the decor is a bit stuffy, old school like, typical of the Ritz chain. The view, services, and location at the MO makes it the best choice for me.I stayed at the Bridge to Bridge View room in July 2006 and the Golden Gate Bridge Mandarin King in August 2007. The main difference is that the Mandarin King has a bathroom with the tub by a large window with fantastic view. From the 48th floor, watching clouds rolling in below us and birds flying by the window, we felt like we were in an airplane. The sky bridge on every floor provides panoramic view of the entire city. Check out my photos for the amazing view.The services at the MO are always top notch. It's not the kind of hotel to nickel and dime its guests (unlike many other five star hotels). The business center offers computers with free internet access and printing (FS and the Ritz charge like $10 for 15 minutes). Also, I called up the room service to inquire about the name of the complementary wine we received upon arrival and was instead offered another complementary bottle. Housekeeping services were good and discreet.Its location is the best compared to the the FS and the Ritz. It's close to Embarcadero and the clock tower, next to a cable car line and the Bart station, within walking distance to Chinatown and the downtown shopping area.The food from the room services were quite good but the taxes, services charges, and gratuity accounted for a third of the bill. I didn't like the fact the the invoice include both 18% gratuity and services charges of $2.5/person, it seems like double charging but at least it's disclosed properly.Overall, the hotel is worth splurging for the best rooms and we plan to come back every summer.

On arrival at the hotel, we were impressed by the warm welcome and efficient check-in and even more impressed by our room size and its amenities. We found that we had a view of the Golden Gate, but i have to say that much of the time this view was obscured by the San Francisco fog. The nautical decor of our room was very striking, but I, personally, loved it and felt it to be in perfect keeping with the hotel's geographical location. We were delighted to find that the hotel was providing us with complimentary continental breakfast and that there was a free wine reception between 5 and 6 pm every day - this proved to be a very congenial event that we appreciated very much after each day of sightseeing in this fabulous city. They also provided free, unlimited internet access.Throughout our stay, we found the staff to be very helpful and friendly and we enjoyed breakfast and several evening meals in the hotel's restaurant. The menu consisted of mainly fish and seafood (as could be expected) and we found the food to be of good quality and reasonably priced. The hotel's location is perfect for visiting San Francisco as it is adjacent to the cable car turnaround on Fisherman's Wharf and also very convenient for hopping onto the great 'streetcars'. Pier 39 is a short and pleasant stroll away.I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to explore this beautiful city and I can't wait to book another stay there so that I can explore the area at my leisure.

The hotel was a perfect launching off point for our adventures in San Francisco. The &quot;old world&quot; style and charm of the hotel made it a great place for a romantic long weekend. The staff was professional, the room very comfortable despite its modest size, and the location excellent. Having read other TripAdvisor reviews, we booked a &quot;Comfy Queen&quot; and requested an upper-level room if possible. Upon arrival, we were given room 709, back and away from the elevator on the hotel's top floor. It was nicely but simply decorated, with a TV monitor and DVD player in the room. The bed was on the soft side but quite comfortable. There was a small desk and dresser, and a nice leather chair in the corner. If we had wanted to, it would have been a nice quiet spot to spend a little time reading or something.The bathroom was among the more spacious in the hotel, I'm assuming, as others have commented on their tiny size. Ours was actually quite large, with a full bath and shower as well as a separate alcove for toilet, and enough space so both of us could get ready at the same time (although we had to swap space in front of the mirror/sink). The street noise was modest for a hotel in the downtown area of a major city. I slept with ear plugs, as I usually do when I travel, and had slept like a dream. My wife had no problems without her ear plugs, and she is a fairly light sleeper. Continental breakfast will not satisfy those who insist on Americanized breakfast rooms or expect a big meal, but we very much enjoyed the assortment of muffins, croissants, butter and jam, fresh fruit, coffee, and freshly squeezed orange juice. It was nice to have trays set out to carry food back to our room. One nice touch was the captain's chairs folded and waiting in our closet--extra seating on the fly!We enjoyed a complementary glass of wine in Fino, the bar/restaurant in the lobby, one evening. We did not dine there but the food looked and smelled great. We also appreciated having water, tea, and coffee available in the lobby at all times. Location is an easy (although uphill) walk from Union Square, right in the heart of the theater district and near Nob Hill. Convenient to virtually everything, including public transport (cable cars, MUNI, BART station, etc.). The Thai restaurant across the street (Ar Roi) is also quite good, by the way!

I hated to have her see America as a place where all these poor souls who clearly need to be in hospitals or institutions have fallen thru the cracks of our frayed social safety net and are living on the streets. Oh, well, I guess truth hurts. The unintelligible shouting beneath our windows kept us awake, the stench of urine in the exterior corners of most buildings made walking to the streetcar a punishment, and the constant sense of menace from filthy people who were obviously not in their right minds was most uncomfortable.I do not recommend this hotel to anyone traveling alone, particularly females.

We thought it was pretty funny and if we hadn't been so exhausted, would have gotten changed and checked out the scene. The heated pool was small, but very funky. It is open late, which is nice, and their were young kids playing in the pool, right near all these hip young party-goers, which was neat to see.The hotel is so funky - decorated with lots of interesting art. The rooms are standard '60s motel rooms repainted and furnished to make them seem hip and current. The room was big and comfortable.

I think they close down at 2 a.m., we had no trouble getting to sleep, but the big windows don't block out all the noise. We had fun listening to drunk people try to carry on conversations and pick up girls/boys. I woke up around 4 a.m. and could still hear people talking outside.We took advantage of the continental breakfast by the pool. A very nice spread for a continental breakfast and it was nice to have it right out the door by the pool. They have these cool &quot;cabana&quot; type things set up with curtains and people were having their breakfast there. We opted for poolside chairs. The best part was that they included Pop Tarts in the offerings - how cool is that?!Overall, it was a fun experience. The neighborhood was not a great one and it was bit off-putting to get a note about car vandalism and theft when you got your parking tag. I'm not sure I would rush back to stay here next time I'm in San Francisco, but I'm not disappointed I tried it. If you are young, like to party, and can appreciate the kitchy fun atmosphere, I say, go for it!!! ANSWERNOTFOUND",Parking was difficult,"(302, 323)",5,1.0,True

It started when booking, when their staff member was blatantly rude on the phone (ok, I said, he's probably just busy/stressed). My rooms were held on credit card, to be paid when checking in by cash. However, the (international) credit card was charged against my wishes, significantly adding to the overall cost. When checking in, the staff member was disoriented and smelled of marijuana (as did the check in office). Myself, my colleagues, and another couple checking in simultaneously, immediately began having problems with the head staff member (who, whislt I attempted to make a formal complaint about the discourteousness of the staff, turned out to be the owner!!). Whilst we were all trying to iron out the creases in our bookings (there was little chance of finding something convenient immediately because of all the city's festivities) - the owner made a few expletives, to the obvious embarrasment of his staff. The rooms themselves were ok, good for a city stay when someone isn't spending much time in their room.

Once thru the line we were quickly checked in and head up to our room on the 26th floor. It is definitely worth the little extra for a higher room because of the view, but mainly because of the glass elevator ride each time you go to and from the room.

The rooms are in excellent condition, and the maid service is first class. The staff are very helpul and courteous at all times, ensuring our stay went without a hitch. The only small complaint we have is that the one and only bar in the hotel (Bobs bar) is very small and gets very crowded from approx 5pm onwards, and getting a seat was almost impossible around those times. However it is no reason not to stay here. When we first arrived after our lengthy journey from Scotland, we were informed that our room (booked and paid for 8 months previousley) had been cancelled by Octopus travel who we had booked the room through. The hotel staff could not have been more helpful in rectifying the situation.San Francisco is well worth a visit and has plenty to offer for all. We would recommend visiting Alcatraz and taking the coach tour of the city, however book your Alcatraz tickets online as far in advance as possible to ensure you get the dates you require. We also hired bikes from Blazing Saddles and rode over the Golden Gate bridge to Tiburon via Sausilto. This is a fantastic way to see the bridge and surrounding area (weather allowing). Sausilto is a must see when you are there and can be accessed by Ferry if you prefer not to bike it, dining is recommeded at Angelino's while you are there.

One caveat, it is an atrium design - the bar and lobby are on the 3rd floor - our rooms were on the 6th floor. Saturday night was very loud due to a roudy bar crew - I called the front desk and the noise quickly died down. If you sleep lightly - higher is better.

Moreover, hair (not the kind on your head) that was clearly not mine were laying in the coverlet. The bedding smelled like someone had already slept in it before and no one had changed the sheets.As if it couldn't get any worse, the bathroom had hair (again, not from your head) on the walls and floors (at least 5 I could count, which is 5 too many).I got my room changed to one that was not in the fire escape. The person at the front desk who helped me, I think his name was Burney, was very nice.

Originally I was supposed to stay at the Hotel Monaco for only 4 nights but on my last day in San Francisco I fractured my leg and needed to have surgery.

Everything felt fresh and new and I thought that the color scheme was really fun!! The bed was extremely comfortable, and I'm rather picky about these things. The main reason I didn't give this hotel a 5 is because there was no Continental breakfast included (although the hotel went out of its way to compensate for the fact that its restaurant was not open on Christmas Day). I never would have thought a thing like this would have mattered so much, but all the nearby restaurants, especially that of the hotel, were REALLY expensive and that really made a big impact on our budgeting. People who are concerned about this might want to plan accordingly and bring cereal or something. There is a mini-bar fridge that had enough extra room in it that it definitely could have accommodated some milk. Of course, we didn' t think of this until afterward.

The rooms were old and a little rough around the edges, but spacious and most importantly: clean. I was in a room not facing the street, and it was very quiet. Our friends were in a room facing the street, so they had quite a bit of street noise, and they complained about water pipe noise as well, which we didn't hear. The have two free computers in the lobby, plus WIFI and comfy chairs in the lobby. Breakfast was nice (donuts, pasty, fruit, coffee, tea) but won't wow you. (There is a tasty crepery down the street). The wine in the afternoons is a nice touch, and they even let me take my glass upstairs so I could drink wine and soak in the jacuzzi tub. Oh, the honor bar prices were very reasonable, as well.The location was great for us. We took Bart from Oakland airport to the Powell street station, then walked to the hotel (we each only had a small bag). We had no trouble walking to the Ferry Building Farmer's market, chinatown, or fisherman's wharf from the hotel. There are plenty of bus stops nearby, for those who aren't walkers. We ran into some panhandlers when we were walking around at night, but we never felt unsafe.Cons: I don't think they have air conditioners, which could ba a problem sometimes (we kept our window open all night in early march to keep a breeze going), the staff wasn't terribly friendly, but they weren't bad.

I stay in the city often on business, and the views from the lower floors of this hotel are not as good as those from The Ritz Carlton, The Fairmont or The Mandarin Oriental, all in the same class of hotel.

The service is fabulous, the food terrific, and the location for walking where most travelers want to go can't be beat. It is without doubt on the pricey side (for instance: 2 beers, a glass of red wine and one small filet mignon (a la carte) was $100 -- reminds me of Tokyo, but I suppose Tokyo would be even more expensive). However, in this class the room rate itself is quite reasonable, and unlike other hotels, guests may use the four story Sports Club/LA (in the same building, with its own entrance for hotel guests) for free. Other hotels have no such amenity attached, and if they send you to one of the upper end health clubs, there is a day pass charge.

The hotel staff in general are very helpful and polite. We were lucky in that we were given what I guess is a larger room with king bed. Room was probably 20X12. The room was painted in soothing shades of creams/tans with white woodwork, coved ceiling and lots of crown moulding, a crystal chandelier, and large flat screen tv.

The attendant Jacob (?) was most accomodating in every way with an unusual ability to do so without making me feel crowded or rushed or uncomfortable that he's just bucking for a tip. It's a little difficult to explain, but in hindsight I believe it's because their customer service for us kept being incredibly helpful throughout our stay. And that's a thing about GP that needs your consideration.We were informed at noon that our room was not yet ready but that we had been upgraded to a larger room. Why? I don't know, but wonder personally if it is because I kept my reservation during a time when the online's (for a period of about one week) dramatically cut the rates per night by $50-75. We noticed this for other hotels we were considering too. With the jitters in the economy for some, I wonder if the hotels needed to fill up. It didn't seem crowded in SanFran/Napa at all. (March 29-April 4) Our room was very much like the website shows. See my pictures for our room (715). The room is clean and daily maid service did well. The bathroom is small with no counter space at all. The shower pressure was awesome and the temp good. Why don't hotels install fans in the bathrooms? Linen is good. Floors are good. The hotel is old, but it's been redone. It is fine. Our king bed was good, but not great. The pillows were the same. It really was fine, but not exceptional. This is where it differs from Campton Place or The Ritz. It's a hotel room that has been as well done over as could be in an old facility. We don't camp out in the room when we are on vacation, so really, don't you just need a good room in a nice place that is above average? GP is a good choice for that. We did feel comfortable and safe here. The staff does make a difference when you're away from home in unfamiliar territory. Studying and planning make the difference. Chinatown is close, the cable cars are close, cabs are available without much ado, etc., etc. I'll be writing an overall review of our visit in SanFran. I will say that Mr. Toad's tours are THE one you want. They dropped us off right at the GP saving us another ride from the wharf. The bottom line is this: If you can get a good deal, it is a good deal. I would stay here again if I could be sure to get this larger type room. Reading other recent reviews makes me believe that the hotel's smaller rooms would have compromised my impression quite a bit as we have been in such smaller type of rooms at other hotels in the past and they are not good. No, no, no. We require a certain level of luxury when we travel and our room at the GP met that level no problem. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3642, 3656)",1,0.0,False

The concierge was fantastic, suggesting restaurants (all good), making reservations and even arranging for the hotel car to drive us. Room service was fast and tasty, housekeeping was excellent and unobtrusive and our car was always ready within minutes of phoning the parking valet.

Unfortunately they camped in the tram/bus shelters of a night time and kept up a constant barrage of abuse and yelling into the early hours of morning.

The bed was not exceedingly comfortable, but wasn't bad either. The rooms are edgy but cold. The bathroom was huge but felt like a hospital and had a serious issue with the water from the shower ending up in the hallway.The lobby is fantastic and the Redwood Room Bar and Asia De Cuba restaurant are some of the cooler spots in the entire city. We returned nightly to long lines of people waiting to get past the ropes into the bar, but the staff remembered us by sight and let us through quickly with a pleasant hello. Most staff remembered our names even though we were only here for 4 days. The staff were as good as any Four Seasons or Peninsula. Surprisingly the incredibly loud bar scene of the lobby did not make it to our room on the 5th floor. Street noise, however, had no problem at all getting into our room at all times and woke us up every morning. The location is excellent.Ultimately the hotel will guarantee a pleasant and exciting stay- but not a quiet and luxurious one. Like most Ian Schrager properties (hotel owner) the aim is for a Cool, Hip, Edgy feeling, not pampering. The staff are great though- no edge at all just awesome service. We knew what we were getting into and liked it. Probably would have been more appropriate for another type of trip, rather than a 1 year anniversayr because &quot;romantic&quot; doesn't come to mind- but we had a great time anyway.No spa onsite.

My husband and I spent a month travelling around California in September and early October. San Francisco was one of our early stops. Supposedly it was to be the highlight at the end of a relaxing 10 day trip up the PCH before we headed off to Lake Tahoe and then Yosemite and Death Valley. Figuring we'd be exhausted after moving on every 2 days we booked the Handlery for 4 days. I've visited San Francisco twice before - but the most recent time was 7 yrs ago. And BOY has the city changed! When booking a hotel I avoided Fishermans Wharf area because it was a real dive the last time I was in the city. Instead, I remembered how central and relatively nice Union Sq was. I read trip advisor reviews and the Handlery seemed to be a good option at the time - plus I managed to get a park and pay deal, which when parking is around $40 a day is a big saving across 4 days.Clearly 7 years is a very very long time. I found the city reversed! Sure Fishermans Wharf is now a not very authentic tourist area but compared to Unions Sq it seemed slightly more pleasant - and generally the hotels were a good deal cheaper. Unions Sq was wall to wall beggars - literally one every 10 feet on the sidewalks and had an overriding stench of urine. I work in London, UK so I'm not exactly immune to city life but this has to be the worst case of vagrancy in any city I have ever visited - and the San Francisco I knew 7-10 yrs ago was nothing like this. Now, I have no idea if this is a real problem, although some guide books advised that the beggars ship themselves in from the suburbs and this is their job. I have no idea but the city needs to do something - both to clear up the city and to help those in need.Anyway, as for the Handlery. Well, the staff were mostly nice although not very helpful - except the guy who worked on the front door, i think he was called a &quot;loss prevention officer&quot;! He was really great - the only employee in the hotel with an ounce of initiative. He seemed to continually keep an eye out for people who were needing attention and then just help them even though it was clearly not his job. For example, one day the bellhops desk was completely unattended yet he came over, asked us the problem - which was just that we wanted to drop off some laundry (another rant by the way - $4.50 for a pair of underwear? I don't think so!) and off he went with our laundry and came back a minute later with the receipt. I really wish I remembered his name because somebody should give the guy a raise. The concierge on the other hand should be given a talking to - useless and rude.The first room we were given on the 7th floor was tiny, dark and right by the lift shaft - a bit like a cell. I immediately went to the front desk and to their credit they did find us another room on the 10th floor which was nicer - although still a disappointment. I don't know why but the rooms just don't live up to their pictures. It's really weird - we just got our photos back and my husband and I have been showing them to people and they're like what's wrong with it - it looks nice. I agree, it does in the pictures but in the flesh - No. The inch of dust on the skirting board didn't help. The bath towels are the size of what in the UK we call hand towels! Also, I'm sorry but someone needs to tell the hotel that they are based in a city - not having drapes or blackout blinds is insane. The only window covering was a wood slat venetian blind which hung away from the window so people across the way - or indeed the workmen working on the exterior of the building could see inside - not great when you want to get dressed. Plus at night the light streaming in is quite disturbing. Oddly, the noise other people have complained about didn't bother me at all - probably because on the 10th floor we were far removed from it.I definitely won't be going back to this hotel and I would actively recommend against it. Frankly, I'm not sure I'll be heading back to San Francisco any time soon either. Who knows, maybe in 7 yrs it'll be back to the charming city I got to know before.

Three blocks from Chinatown, Two blocks from the Famous Cable Cars and Four blocks from BART and a heafty walk to Pac-Bell SBC (AT&amp;T) Ballpark. My girlfriend and I took our three grown children for the Chinese New Year's Celebration weekend, and were able to walk back after all the festivities without having to fight the massive crowds. The next day, we hopped on the cable car to ride down to Fishermans Wharf for sour dough bread, clam chowder, chocolate and to see the Sea Lions at Pier 39. Then we took the other line back up to Chinatown for &quot;dim sum&quot; and walked down to catch BART to go under the trans-Bay tunnel. This place is a private, members only establishment during the business week because its in the heart of the business/financial district. But on the weekends its open to those who know about it. Rooms are neat and clean but a little small for a family trip (that's why we needed two rooms), but the location is worth the cramped space (esp. if all you need is a place to sleep.) Parking is $28.50 per day in the Embarcadero Center underground garage, but the security is really good there.

After paying extra for a &quot;premium&quot; room, we felt like prize suckers when we first walked into the room. The carpet was old and dirty. The ceiling had a hole in it. The wallpaper was literally peeling off the wall. Clearly, no furniture or fixture had been updated in decades, and the room and bathroom smelled of mold. The TV didn't turn off except by unplugging the set. I had to call the front desk to confirm that we were, in fact, in a premium room and she assured us that we were. It was a dark, dank, unpleasant experience and I advise anyone to be careful to remember that you get what you pay for. Or, in this case, sometimes you get much less than you pay for. I doubt I would have found a worse room in a roadside motel. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(821, 835)",1,0.0,False

We arrived at 11am thinking we would just drop off our luggage and hit the town. The room was surprisingly ready so we were able to check-in early. Since there were no rooms with two double beds available, we were given a room on the 17th floor with a king size bed. I requested a roll-away bed and that was delivered the next day. If I had any complaints at all, it would be having to call again for the roll-away bed but this is really a non-issue.The hotel is in a great location in the financial district. We took the BART between SFO and the hotel. At $5.35 per person one way, it is more economical than a cab. The BART station is only a few blocks away in the Embarcadero area. Also, the hotel is within blocks of lots of MUNI bus and train lines so travel is convenient. In fact, I would discourage renting a car unless necessary since valet parking is $50 + taxes per night. The pillowtop bed is incredibly comfortable. I usually don't sleep well in hotels but the Le Meridien bed is an exception. Also, the hotel was extremely quiet. Our room was very close to the elevators but I did not hear people in the hallway or in the rooms next door. The lady at the concierge desk is amazing. I swear she is a human GPS. She'll give awesome recommendations for restaurants.Check-out was easy with no surprises. Overall, this upscale hotel is highly recommended and its location is hard to beat.
