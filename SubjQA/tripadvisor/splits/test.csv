I was met with by a man at the front desk (Hamid) who immediately put me on the defensive by telling me he had no reservation under my name! I immediately brought out my written confirmation and then he told me it had been cancelled! I had just reconfirmed with the front desk the week before, so I had no idea how this had happened. He did walk me in, not honoring the rate I had confirmed and gave me my key. I again questioned this to which I was told,&quot;You will have to fight it out with management tomorrow.&quot; As livid as I was I was in no mood to &quot;turn New York&quot; on him and went to my room. Room was nicely put together, king bed, desk, nice closet and on the inside right around the corner from the lobby so no traffic noise. Van Ness is terribly noisy so get one of these rooms if you stay here. Only drawback was a bigger dresser would have been nice as I stayed six nights. Bathroom was a nice size with good counter space, tub and shower were in a nice alcove. I was pleased with the room scheme and overall look. About a 1/2 hour later I received a call from the front desk from the overnight manager. She thought I was another guest who had extended and had no record of me being in the room! I immediately went to the front desk with my paperwork and couldn't have found a more accomodating and apologetic person to work this out. She was wonderful, honored my rate and also reprogrammed the key for six nights instead of only one as the guy before did. I then felt confident the rest of my stay would go smoothly, as it did. This is a wonderful hotel with nice rooms, wonderful breakfast each morning (the waffles are awesome) and close to everything.

I immediately brought out my written confirmation and then he told me it had been cancelled! I had just reconfirmed with the front desk the week before, so I had no idea how this had happened. He did walk me in, not honoring the rate I had confirmed and gave me my key. I again questioned this to which I was told,&quot;You will have to fight it out with management tomorrow.&quot; As livid as I was I was in no mood to &quot;turn New York&quot; on him and went to my room. Room was nicely put together, king bed, desk, nice closet and on the inside right around the corner from the lobby so no traffic noise. Van Ness is terribly noisy so get one of these rooms if you stay here. Only drawback was a bigger dresser would have been nice as I stayed six nights. Bathroom was a nice size with good counter space, tub and shower were in a nice alcove. I was pleased with the room scheme and overall look. About a 1/2 hour later I received a call from the front desk from the overnight manager. She thought I was another guest who had extended and had no record of me being in the room! I immediately went to the front desk with my paperwork and couldn't have found a more accomodating and apologetic person to work this out. She was wonderful, honored my rate and also reprogrammed the key for six nights instead of only one as the guy before did. I then felt confident the rest of my stay would go smoothly, as it did. This is a wonderful hotel with nice rooms, wonderful breakfast each morning (the waffles are awesome) and close to everything. The rooms are kept clean and I would liken it to a &quot;no-frills&quot; Inn with a boutique feel. I would stay here again on my next trip to San Francisco.

In the morning, a New York Times is delivered to your door. They also have free Chronicles downstairs in the lobby. It was fun to sit in the living room in front of the fireplace and read the papers while getting geeked on free Starbucks.3) There are a ton of great places to go to eat or have a drink within walking distance, including a cool bar &quot;Swig&quot; and an Irish bar a few blocks over toward the shopping area. The Olympic Cafe on the next block over doesn't look like much, but it has a good breakfast, and The Daily News Cafe (?) nearby was the best meal we had.

We ducked out of there and went to King of Thai Noodle, where we got great service for probably 1/6th of the price of a dinner back at the hotel. 4) At our request we did receive a fish, &quot;John&quot;, who made it only 2 days out of our 7-day stay. I called the front desk when the fish turned on his side -- they promised to send someone up to get the fish and return it to the big aquarium, but no one came and John checked out (permanently) not long thereafter.5) The hotel's location is great -- close to good shopping (Bloomie's, Nordstrom, etc.), the cable car lines, and all sorts of transit. I regret that we rented a car for the whole week we were there -- parking is really expensive, although the bellman did clue us into a cheaper garage around the corner from the hotel.

The price on Expedia was a better deal than what the hotel's website was directly offering so I called Nikko and they matched it. Upon arriving we checked in and were immediately helped by the very friendly staff. No lines and it took only a few minutes.Our room was 1523 and yes the room was kind of small but we were never in the room so it didn't matter. The bed was VERY comfortable and the flat screen tv was an added bonus. We didn't have a spectacular view but a hotel room isn't the reason we decided to come to San Fran. The bathroom is on the old side but served it's purpose fine. The only issue we ever had is that they didn't clean our room one day. We even called twice during the day and asked them to come clean it and when we arrived back to our room at 11pm it still hadn't been cleaned. But other than that, no problems.The location is absolutely perfect. Very easy to get to the cable cars and shopping. Taxis are always lined up on the street between the Nikko and the Hilton. We had drinks at Farleys across from Starbucks and First Crush which is on OFarrell and Cyril. Very dark and romantic and very nice service. We sat at the bar and saw a couple get engaged behind us. We never made it to Anzu although we heard it was great. Starbucks every morning and there is always a line but it goes very fast.

I had been on every website possible looking for a nice place that was safe and comfortable and affordable, logging about 4 hours a day. I found this hotel on several websites but couldn't afford the price. On a whim I went to the hotel's own website and was able to get an unbelieveable price of $149 a night for a two queen-size bed superior room. Completely worth it and then some! I would definitely stay here again. ANSWERNOTFOUND",spacious quarters,"(176, 193)",1,0.0,False

The rooms are clean, light, and tastefully decorated in a very modern style; very comfy sleigh bed with superior down and cotton bedding.

The Clift's location is not ideal for sweeping views; but this was acceptable with me when selecting the hotel.

No need for artwork that way, just the pleasant mix of colors, fabrics, glass, and contemporary furniture. Is the decor what I might select for my home? Probably not, but the change of scenery sure was fun for a evening. The room had candles and matches ready to go and the warm indirect lighting helped make this a contemporary romantic getaway.

The location of the Clift is excellent for the theatre/shopping crowd and getting a cab is not too difficult. The front desk staff and the doormen were very friendly and helpful.

The decor and the food are nice, but they must have been understaffed the morning I decided to go, although the restaurant was not even 25% full. Breakfast was included with my special package rate, so this is where I was going to dine no matter what, but I expected decent, if not excellent and courteous service at such a fine restaurant. I could barely get a refill on my iced tea. The table next to mine was getting very impatient and almost downright rude about the slow service. All in all, I would steer clear of breakfast, unless it's included in your rate. Reviews for lunch and dinner seem to be better...so maybe someday I'll check it out, but with so many other choices in the city, the Asia De Cuba left a bad impression on me and it will be some time before I return to eat there. Some people leaving reviews have complained about noise, smelling smoke in the hallways, and having no dresser in the room, but I did not encounter any problem with these. I found the closet adequate for my luggage and unpacking of my necessary items so as to reduce wrinkling. As for noise, this is the CITY, not a country getaway, so I anticipated I'd hear some noise at some point in my stay, but honestly, I was never disrupted by noise in any way.

I've generally bid on a &quot;four-star&quot; room, and have ended up in such typical business hotels as the Hilton and the Holiday Inn in the Financial District. My one bid on a &quot;three-star&quot; put me in the Pickwick, which turned out to be a decent enough experience. I turned to Priceline over Labor Day weekend after I discovered that my favorite &quot;budget&quot; hotel, the Castle Inn, could not accommodate me. I was unable to get a &quot;four-star&quot; or a &quot;boutique&quot; room on my latest attempt, and my offer of $72 a night for a &quot;three-star&quot; was finally accepted. When I was given the name of the hotel, I read the reviews here, and although I was taken aback by what I read, I hoped for the best.Unfortunately, the general consensus on the place turned out to be correct. I arrived at about midnight, and even though Priceline had guaranteed a late arrival, the desk clerk made a snide comment about my arrival time. The king room I requested was not available, and she claimed that the only room left in the hotel was a queen. She assured me, however, that I would be getting a non-smoking room, and I decided to reserve further judgment until I got upstairs.I knew I would be disappointed as I walked down the hall to the room--the wallpaper was marked and dirty, and the paint on the doors was marred and chipped. When I arrived at my room (659), I was greeted by a broken switchplate and the odors of both mildew and cigarette smoke. The lights came on to reveal cheap, scratched furniture with cigarette burns, worn and dirty carpet that was well overdue for replacement, and a rock-hard bed with a worn bedspread. The tub had rust stains, and the vanity was stratched and burned as well. The ventilation system was literally decades old, and during my entire four-day stay, I could not get any airflow in the room.The service was no better. Both the night and the morning desk clerks insisted that no other rooms were available, and since I was preoccupied with business matters, I eventually gave up and resigned myself to staying in the room. For two of the four nights there, I received no linen service, and my call to housekeeping went unanswered. Garage parking was $23 per night, including tax, which was well in keeping with prices throughout the city.I realize that $72 isn't a lot of money for a hotel room in SF, and I don't have a problem staying in budget accommodations. However, I do have a problem with the place being advertised as a &quot;three-star&quot; establishment, which, according to both Priceline and AAA, is one that offers special amenities. Quite simply, the hotel is in desperate need of renovation (both the physical plant and the front office), and unless you have no other option, I would give it a wide berth.

When I was given the name of the hotel, I read the reviews here, and although I was taken aback by what I read, I hoped for the best.Unfortunately, the general consensus on the place turned out to be correct. I arrived at about midnight, and even though Priceline had guaranteed a late arrival, the desk clerk made a snide comment about my arrival time. The king room I requested was not available, and she claimed that the only room left in the hotel was a queen. She assured me, however, that I would be getting a non-smoking room, and I decided to reserve further judgment until I got upstairs.I knew I would be disappointed as I walked down the hall to the room--the wallpaper was marked and dirty, and the paint on the doors was marred and chipped. When I arrived at my room (659), I was greeted by a broken switchplate and the odors of both mildew and cigarette smoke. The lights came on to reveal cheap, scratched furniture with cigarette burns, worn and dirty carpet that was well overdue for replacement, and a rock-hard bed with a worn bedspread. The tub had rust stains, and the vanity was stratched and burned as well. The ventilation system was literally decades old, and during my entire four-day stay, I could not get any airflow in the room.The service was no better. Both the night and the morning desk clerks insisted that no other rooms were available, and since I was preoccupied with business matters, I eventually gave up and resigned myself to staying in the room. For two of the four nights there, I received no linen service, and my call to housekeeping went unanswered. Garage parking was $23 per night, including tax, which was well in keeping with prices throughout the city.I realize that $72 isn't a lot of money for a hotel room in SF, and I don't have a problem staying in budget accommodations. However, I do have a problem with the place being advertised as a &quot;three-star&quot; establishment, which, according to both Priceline and AAA, is one that offers special amenities. Quite simply, the hotel is in desperate need of renovation (both the physical plant and the front office), and unless you have no other option, I would give it a wide berth.

You can tell that the building is older, so there is wear and tear (e.g., a small rip in the couch cushion and trim along bedroom floor coming off the wall). However, the structure itself is very sturdy. I believe that the place was originally a condo (there are currently some residents who still reside there), so the walls are thick and we never heard our neighbors (although I could hear from the hallway that they had a young and loud child). Given the bedroom, the dining area and the living room, we had plenty of space for the 5 of us.

One block from both the Powell and California cable lines, about 3 blocks from Chinatown, and two blocks from the Grace Cathedral and a great little park. The park has a playground and is the place where local Nob Hill residents take their dogs to play. We took our 5yo to this park a lot to burn off energy and watch the antics of the dogs playing with each other. As other reviewers have noted, it is on Nob 'Hill', so you get a great view, but even if you take the trolley, you will have at least one block of an uphill hike. Given how much we ate during the vacation, this wasn't a bad thing for us. Speaking of places to eat, other than Chinatown, we didn't find too many places really close by (although you can easy access them by cable car). The exception is the Nob Hill Cafe which is about 3-4 blocks and has great Italian food. The hotel offers a continental breakfast, with juices, cereals, bagels, and fresh pastries every morning.

There is also a laundry room in the basement with 5-6 washers and dryers. There is a gated parking area behind the hotel isolated from the street.

My wife and I had often stayed at the old Clift Hotel before it was taken over and renovated by the Ian Schrager group. The old Clift may have been showing its age, but it had spacious, elegantly furnished rooms in a convenient part of town. What a disappointment it was to see what has been done to this once great hotel ! We booked an Studio Jr. Suite which was described as an &quot;L&quot; shaped room. We quickly discovered that this was one of the former spacious rooms from the old Clift that we remembered so fondly, but it had been chopped up into two rooms ... creating a window-less bedroom area and very cramped sitting area. The decor makes abundant use of petroleum based synthetic materials (think plastic draperies, plastic night stands &amp; tables, plastic covered furnitiure) and has most opposing walls covered floor to ceiling with tinted mirrors. The mirrors tend to give the room a subtle feeling of nausea and the hard bench type furniture was uncomfortable. The bedding was of good quality but they must have contracted with a lumber company for the mattresses. My wife was particularly disappointed in the bathroom. It was cramped, with barely enough room for one person to turn around. There was no counter space and even the tub was scaled down to fit in such a small space. The old Clift had spacious, well appointed, marble bathrooms.The lobby and public areas have very dim lighting, which seemed stylish and attractive at first, but then became annoying. The elevator compartment was so darkened you could not even see the person standing next to you.They have even ruined the famous Redwood Room Bar. All of the warmth and intimacy of the old Redwood Room is missing, replaced by garish lighting and hard, uninviting bench type seats. The hostess greeted us at entrace with &quot;Oh .. are you here to inquire about reservations?&quot;. Acutally, we just wanted a glass of wine before going to dinner, but after seeing what has been done to the ambiance, I was almost in tears.Unless you are attacted to dark spaces and synthetic materials, I would give this hotel a pass.

The old Clift may have been showing its age, but it had spacious, elegantly furnished rooms in a convenient part of town. What a disappointment it was to see what has been done to this once great hotel ! We booked an Studio Jr. Suite which was described as an &quot;L&quot; shaped room. We quickly discovered that this was one of the former spacious rooms from the old Clift that we remembered so fondly, but it had been chopped up into two rooms ... creating a window-less bedroom area and very cramped sitting area. The decor makes abundant use of petroleum based synthetic materials (think plastic draperies, plastic night stands &amp; tables, plastic covered furnitiure) and has most opposing walls covered floor to ceiling with tinted mirrors. The mirrors tend to give the room a subtle feeling of nausea and the hard bench type furniture was uncomfortable. The bedding was of good quality but they must have contracted with a lumber company for the mattresses. My wife was particularly disappointed in the bathroom. It was cramped, with barely enough room for one person to turn around. There was no counter space and even the tub was scaled down to fit in such a small space. The old Clift had spacious, well appointed, marble bathrooms.The lobby and public areas have very dim lighting, which seemed stylish and attractive at first, but then became annoying. The elevator compartment was so darkened you could not even see the person standing next to you.They have even ruined the famous Redwood Room Bar. All of the warmth and intimacy of the old Redwood Room is missing, replaced by garish lighting and hard, uninviting bench type seats. The hostess greeted us at entrace with &quot;Oh .. are you here to inquire about reservations?&quot;. Acutally, we just wanted a glass of wine before going to dinner, but after seeing what has been done to the ambiance, I was almost in tears.Unless you are attacted to dark spaces and synthetic materials, I would give this hotel a pass. We certainly will not be back. ANSWERNOTFOUND",bedroom area and very cramped sitting,"(668, 705)",1,0.0,False

We had room 608, which had a queen bed with bathroom and closet. The room was neat and clean with stylish, modern decor, but it was extremely tiny, although I expected that from reading other people's reviews. Just be prepared for a 2-3 foot perimeter around the bed, and that's it. Not much of a view, but you're in the city center, so that was also expected. It was reasonably quiet, in any case. Nice TV with cable, CD player, a chair or two, trashcan, and a nighttable was all that was in the room. There is no A/C, so we kept the windows open, which was fine. San Francisco usually has pretty temperate/cool weather.The bathroom was also tiny; standard tub, toilet crammed in right next to it, and sink across from that. Decent water pressure, plenty of hot water. I didn't much care for the sink though. It is about the size of a urinal, and there is a shelf right above it, so you can't splash your face with water without hitting your head on the shelf. Also hard to spit when brushing your teeth. Overall, it wasn't too bad though; just annoying.The lobby looked really nice, and the staff were friendly and pleasant. Breakfast was minimal - just coffee and muffins in a basket in the lobby, but the muffins were pretty good. We went around the corner to Mel's Diner on Mission St to supplement our breakfast - great food, cheap. Annabelle's Bistro was right next to the hotel, so we stopped in there for drinks in the evening, and it seemed like a good, local hangout. The location was good in the center of downtown. It was one block to Market Street with tons of shopping, restaurants, big office buildings, just a few blocks from San Francisco Bay. You can get to/from the SFO airport easily using the BART subway system, which has a stop just around the corner from the hotel on Market St; it was a $6 ticket/25 minute ride straight there. We used the MUNI system of trolleys to get around otherwise, which was also just around the corner and cheap at $1.50 anywhere you want to go on the line. The F line was our friend and goes all the way out to Fisherman's Wharf in about 15-20 minutes with stops at the piers along the way. We paid cash (exact change required) to the driver each time, but you can also get a MUNI card, which might be a little cheaper, depending on how many rides you take. As far as fun things to do, we had a car for two days ($35/day to park at the Mosser) and traveled to the Napa/Sonoma area one afternoon and hit a few of the wineries for tastings. It took about an hour to get there, and most of them close by 5 pm, so don't get up too late. Beautiful scenery, nice wines, tons of vineyards to try. The next day we drove to Muir Woods, which is an ancient sequoia forest with a walking trail. That was amazing; I felt like a dinosaur would come lumbering out from amongst the giant trees at any moment. We also hit the five-course Cirque du Soleil-style dinner show, Teatro Zinzanni at Pier 27/29; great food, great show - not cheap, but we thought it was worth it; book ahead. My favorite sidetrip was a bike ride across the Golden Gate Bridge to Sausalito. We rented bikes from Blazing Saddles at Fisherman's Wharf for around $45 each, and it was a simply astounding ride past Ghirardelli Square to Fort Point, over the bridge, and down to the cute, little village of Sausalito, where we took the ferry back across (ferry ticket included in price). Took about 2-3 hours total.  Okay, back to the hotel. We also stayed four nights at the Queen Anne in Pacific Heights about 1.5 miles away, and both of us liked the Queen Anne better to be honest. The price was about the same (~$150/night), but the Queen Anne seemed more authentic to San Francisco, extremely cool, relaxed neighborhood (Fillmore district) with lots of neat boutiques and no chains, the rooms were 5x bigger, they had a better, more expansive breakfast, better bathrooms, and very reasonable access to transportation. However, if you really want to be in the bustling city center, convenient access to everything is the most important factor for you, and you don't mind being in a more corporate-y area, then the Mosser is the place for you, and is very reasonably priced for its location, especially if you get the rooms with the shared bathroom in the hall.

It is about the size of a urinal, and there is a shelf right above it, so you can't splash your face with water without hitting your head on the shelf. Also hard to spit when brushing your teeth. Overall, it wasn't too bad though; just annoying.The lobby looked really nice, and the staff were friendly and pleasant. Breakfast was minimal - just coffee and muffins in a basket in the lobby, but the muffins were pretty good. We went around the corner to Mel's Diner on Mission St to supplement our breakfast - great food, cheap. Annabelle's Bistro was right next to the hotel, so we stopped in there for drinks in the evening, and it seemed like a good, local hangout. The location was good in the center of downtown. It was one block to Market Street with tons of shopping, restaurants, big office buildings, just a few blocks from San Francisco Bay. You can get to/from the SFO airport easily using the BART subway system, which has a stop just around the corner from the hotel on Market St; it was a $6 ticket/25 minute ride straight there. We used the MUNI system of trolleys to get around otherwise, which was also just around the corner and cheap at $1.50 anywhere you want to go on the line. The F line was our friend and goes all the way out to Fisherman's Wharf in about 15-20 minutes with stops at the piers along the way. We paid cash (exact change required) to the driver each time, but you can also get a MUNI card, which might be a little cheaper, depending on how many rides you take. As far as fun things to do, we had a car for two days ($35/day to park at the Mosser) and traveled to the Napa/Sonoma area one afternoon and hit a few of the wineries for tastings. It took about an hour to get there, and most of them close by 5 pm, so don't get up too late. Beautiful scenery, nice wines, tons of vineyards to try. The next day we drove to Muir Woods, which is an ancient sequoia forest with a walking trail. That was amazing; I felt like a dinosaur would come lumbering out from amongst the giant trees at any moment. We also hit the five-course Cirque du Soleil-style dinner show, Teatro Zinzanni at Pier 27/29; great food, great show - not cheap, but we thought it was worth it; book ahead. My favorite sidetrip was a bike ride across the Golden Gate Bridge to Sausalito. We rented bikes from Blazing Saddles at Fisherman's Wharf for around $45 each, and it was a simply astounding ride past Ghirardelli Square to Fort Point, over the bridge, and down to the cute, little village of Sausalito, where we took the ferry back across (ferry ticket included in price). Took about 2-3 hours total.  Okay, back to the hotel. We also stayed four nights at the Queen Anne in Pacific Heights about 1.5 miles away, and both of us liked the Queen Anne better to be honest. The price was about the same (~$150/night), but the Queen Anne seemed more authentic to San Francisco, extremely cool, relaxed neighborhood (Fillmore district) with lots of neat boutiques and no chains, the rooms were 5x bigger, they had a better, more expansive breakfast, better bathrooms, and very reasonable access to transportation. However, if you really want to be in the bustling city center, convenient access to everything is the most important factor for you, and you don't mind being in a more corporate-y area, then the Mosser is the place for you, and is very reasonably priced for its location, especially if you get the rooms with the shared bathroom in the hall.

The location is not bad, though, not right on the cable car line, it is close enough. Be sure and visit the hotels &quot;partner&quot; restaurant, the Fly-Trap. It is just around the corner. Nice place for a martini and their 3 oysters on the half shell starter while enjoying very smooth live jazz. The room was extremely clean! Spotless! Not fancy at all...just what you needed. The sink area outside the bathroom was very small. Not a bad size room for the Union Square area. Really enjoyed the outside courtyard in the lobby area. Never a problem getting an elevator. Service was extremely fast in all areas. Inside the hotel itself was very quiet. I like the fact that the window opend a bit..not much but just enough to feel the outside air. We live in the mountains and enjoy the noise of the city which is so different than home. We did not find the street noise bad at all. Only two things that I was disapointed with...The pool area was sans decor. Looked like it was planned to be hosed out 5 times a day. Very stark and cold feeling. With a few people there it got very loud. The best times to go to any hotel pool seems to be early in the morning and later at night. As someone had mentioned before, the pool water was not warm but after getting in, it was refreshing. It was very nice not to have to pay more to use the exercise area. Actually we were happy to have the pool and spa, not many hotels have a pool in this area. I think only 5 or 6. Again very clean.The one place I would have to give the hotel a black mark would be with the food. We ate breakfast in the Jasime room. Again the staff were lovely...but the food was not excepional. The menu was dull. The second day we ordered breakfast in our room. The fruit plate was dried out and looked very nasty. The Warwick Regis has an amazing fruit plate! Now, that hotel has the best chef! San Francisco has so many fantastic places to eat who would want to eat room service in your room? We do on occasion and this is not the place to order it! For dinner, hop in a cab and take a 5 minute ride to John's Grill for the Oysters Wellington. Ohsogood! I recomended this hotel as high as I did mostly because of the staff and the cleanness.

One drawback was the wc (toilet) was loud when flushed. it appeared to be just like you would see in public bathrooms. Service was standard with the request you save your towles to save on water. The tub on the other hand was big and deep, great for a relaxing bath.In the lobby is a tour stand, that you can get setup for tours, I highly recommend the hop on hop off as it gave you great access to most tourist locations including a drive across the Golden Gate Bridge.

It is also very close to the underground subway which brings you to airport. If you look at the map, Powell Hotel is at the centre of almost everything. It's within walking distance to Union Square, and along the walk, there are plenty of shops and small restaurants. It's the typical San Francisco life-style. You can experience it better in here, rather than the 5-star hotels (the four Big Four hotels in SF).//RoomPowell Hotel is a bit old. It's special because it's old.

And again, you really don't need to stay in those posh hotels to experience San Francisco unless you stay in your room 24/7.//ServiceThe staff were all very helpful and kind. I took a lot of brochures and information booklets from the counter. Tour arrangement can also be made at the helpdesk. However, I do recommend visitors to do their own research and review before deciding on which tour and agent to choose. There are a lot of agencies and prices do differ.

Near Powell Hotel is a nice Indian restaurant which I highly recommend. The Thai restaurant nearby was fabulous as well. I'm a Malaysian and I've had plenty of experience with Indian, Malay, Thai and Asian cuisine.

This location is primarily intended for business travelers and has few tourist amenities. The rooms were clean comfortable and affordable. They feature large flat screen TVs and free wired Wi-Fi. In the lobby there is a Starbucks that is open during the day till 2pm. Our room was on the top floor and had some nice bridge and city views. The hotel also has a small snack bar next to the front desk. The hotel restaurant and bar looked much underused on the weekend but San Francisco has too many good food choices in any price range to consider hotel food. We did try an Indian fast food restaurant and a Chinese restaurant that were two blocks away and open weekends. Both were very good and inexpensive.The Hotel is very centrally located in the financial district. This means on weekends, restaurant choices are limited and the streets are quiet in the evening. The hotel is walking distance to a trolley line, bus lines and the Montgomery BART station. We purchased a three day MUNI bus and trolley pass at the airport and had no problem getting to all of the sights.If you are a tourist seeking a clean, comfortable inexpensive place this hotel fits the bill. Be sure to check out the special weekend rates. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The rooms were clean comfortable and affordable,"(266, 313)",1,0.75,True

The rooms were obviously recently remodeled and were very nice. But the physical characteristics of the room was not the star...that belonged to the view!A beautiful, stunning view was waiting for us when we opened the blinds.Picture this. A view of Chinatown to your extreme left. Alcatraz to your middle left. Coit Tower in the middle. The San Francisco Bay to your right and Treasure Island to your extreme right. By far, the greatest view I've ever had in my numerous trips to SF. I have thought about that view at least ten times a day since leaving. You must ask for a higher floor when staying. It's essential!From that point on, our trip and our hotel stay were a dream. The amazing king bed with a featherbed mattress was to die for! These beds rival the Ritz Carlton in Half Moon Bay and Quail Lodge in Carmel (routinely known as the best beds in the area)! Room service was fast and effecient, plus the food quality was above average. All requests to the front desk were fulfilled promptly and swiftly. Now, you may be wondering why I would give the hotel 4 stars after an obvious 5 star review. Well, like all hotels in SF, the Hilton institutes a ridiculously overpriced parking fee. This time, it was $44 nightly and then there is a $6 parking tax on top of that! That's right folks, $100 for the &quot;privilege&quot; of parking. Luckily, I got a great deal on the room rate to compensate for this. But until SF hotels change their ways and institute REASONABLE parking charges, I will not give any hotel 5 stars in SF. Upon check-out we did have a minor issue. We were never given a ticket when we handed the car to Valet. We figured it would be sorted by room number. So after we checked out, we were asked for our ticket. When I explained we didn't have one, the valet service was quite rude and said, &quot;Oh YOU WERE GIVEN A TICKET!&quot;, like I would lie about it LOL.

The cable car line turnaround is at the end of the street and the the street car/tram/trolley whatever you want to call them right behind that. Transport was a breeze. There is a booth near the Cable Car turnaround where you can get a daily transport passport giving you unlimited rides on all the buses cable cars and street cars for 11 bucks. Hotel Check-in/staff: The staff were absolutley fantastic. Hillary the concierge was fantastic, its not often that you there service is so good that you can remember the persons name. There was a problem with our airport connection (we had a really early flight out ) and when they contacted the hotel through the night she rebooked our transfer for us so as not to disturb us. Housekeeping left the room spotless. The hotel is definitely well run. Amenities: No Gym or Pool but this didnt worry us at all there, is an adjoining italian restaurant which was delicious. Complimentary internet/PC use was so helpful. In room safe (many hotels are reverting to only having deposit boxes at reception - worth checking). Everything in this hotel was new - nothing dodgy at all. Room: The king size bed was divine, decent linen, funishings were new with a decent size bathroom - (Loccitane products). Room wasnt large but this is usual in nearly all the San Fran hotels I've stayed in. If you are a light sleeper they also have an inside room option it was nice to open up the window and watch the world go by outside. Noise: The hotel is away from the cable car line however there is a nightclub just across the road, and it did get a bit noisier on Saturday night, not from music but people out on the street. If you are a light sleeper take your earplugs or request an inside room. Shopping : Westfield San Francisco Centre is a minute away and union Square is just up the hill.

There is a croissant/bun shop ('Les Croissants') just across the road from the hotel entrance, I'd recommend buying breakfast from there. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(514, 528)",2,0.0,False

The representative was nice and offered us an upgrade but told us to check the &quot;Petite room&quot; before we upgrade. So we went and checked the room we originally bought. The room is very petite. The hallway from the door to the actual bed is very tiny. The bed was horrible. We sat on the bed and we could literally feel the springs on the bed. So we decided to go for an upgrade. Upgrade of &quot;Petite&quot; was &quot;Deluxe&quot; and then &quot;Club room which comes with a continental breakfast&quot;. We decided to check the Club room. One thing we noticed was that all three rooms had a 19 inch tv despite the size of the room. Club room was very spacy but the bed felt the same. Bathroom was ok with usual stall shower and a bathtub.

The hotel is nicely kept and clean. The building has some interesting architectural details. Still, it is an old and somewhat tired property and some of the remodeling is not the best. Same for the fitness center -- the room and equipment are older, but meet my needs. The food is good, but overpriced. If you are bothered by traffic notice, ask for a quiet room in back. The rooms in front overlook Market, which is a busy street. The staff, the price and the BART station make the difference for me.

Having said that, being a &quot;historic&quot; hotel does mean it has character and beautiful tall ceilings and big open hallways and nice wood work. All of this is common on the East coast, but not so much in California.Also, San Francisco has A LOT of homeless people. You won't see as many in New York or Boston because of the weather, it is much easier to be homeless in San Francisco where you won't freeze to death at night.So if you are visiting from rural America or Europe and haven't seen the homeless before, than you will if you visit San Francisco and that has nothing to do specifically with the Hotel Whitcomb.As there have been many reviews it has already been pointed out that the hotel is in a great location for getting around San Francisco via public transportation. It took about 30-35 minutes to get there from SFO airport via the BART (Bay Area Rapid Transport). It was also an easy walk to the Marcone Center where I was attending a conference.Walking back to the hotel from the conference late at night I did pass some homeless and some adult themed establishments, but I felt completely safe as the streets are well lit and there were plenty of people around.Near the hotel are plenty of small places to eat and a Walgreens and also a post office. Considering the excellent price I got, this is by far one of the best deals I've ever had and would be happy to stay at this hotel in the future. I will definitely recommend it to others.The hotel gym was adequate, the cardio machines are on the old side, but worked. The gym did have a nice view of the street.I did notice the hotel seemed to have quite a few Asian tour groups staying there, which I take as a good sign as those tend to be a little more choosy/picky about where they stay.From my experience the only word of caution I would have is to check out your room before you unpack and make sure it is o.k. I was on the third floor and my room overlooked the duct work/exhaust system for the hotel. See the picture below.Because of this there was always a constant humming sound in the room. It wasn't too loud, but it was there. I found it soothing, almost like the constant roar of the ocean at an waterside hotel, but I could see how others would find it bothersome.Also, the window had decorative drapes, a thin curtain, and then light blocking shades. In my room the light blocking shades had a huge gap when I tried to close them, a good 8 inches! I was able to over come this by pulling one of the deocrative drapes across the window. However, again for sensative sleepers who need it to be completely dark, this would be a problem.The fact that these two little things are the only negatives I have to mention should make it clear how nice this hotel is!Also, if you stay here definitely check out the Hall of History.

I've stayed at Westins, Four Seasons, Ritz Carltons, Pan Pacific Hotels, and Intercontinentals as well as small hotels in Europe and on the complete opposite end of the spectrum there have been the occassional Holiday Inns and the like.I also know San Francisco quite well and am there a few times every year. This trip was last minute and I could not get into the usual St. Francis or W or Palace due to the convention having them all booked.The Serrano was on the convention hotel list and the day before the convention a room did open up for $199 a night. The price without a convention in town, I understand, would be $149 and I'm sure much less for travelers able to use priceline or similar sites. For this location in this city, and the quality of the accommodations here, you just cannot beat this hotel for the price. I don't know where to begin. The location is perfect, a 2 minute walk from Union Square with it's transportation and everything else and about 15 minutes at most to the Moscone center. The lobby is absolutely beautiful but small enough to feel like a vey large living room, especially during the free coffee service from 5 a.m to 10 a.m. daily and the free evening wine reception.It's great fun to talk to and meet other people during these times and I imagine for the single recreational traveler this would be quite a plus. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful, unlike say, the St. Francis which has suffered a severe drop in service points with me during the past few years. At the Serrano, if you have a whim they will make every effort to indulge it. When I emerged from the taxi in front a bellman was there, immediately asked my name, and has remembered it ever since (I'm still here as I write). The front desk staff upon check in were joking and so friendly that I felt like I was coming to visit my cousins or friends who I have known forever.My room is slightly small, but has a king bed with desk large enough to spread my work out on, a well-stocked minibar, and is beautifully decorated. The bathroom is quite small with powder-room sized sink and toilet, but also beautifully appointed with leopard bathrobe and Aveda toiletries. The tub is deep, although a bit more narrow than average. If an extremely large person wanted to take a bath rather than shower it may be problematic. But some rooms here do have jacuzzi tubs for two. There is little space to put your own toiletry kits but that's fine, I put mine on the floor under the sink. Small inconvenience considering everything else. Everything is spotlessly clean.I am on a higher floor and asked for a quiet room but since the windows are double paned I don't think lower floor rooms would have a noise problem. I can't even hear sirens going by. I see them but can't hear them. Today I worked in my room all morning and did not hear the housekeeping staff banging around in the rooms next to me. Didn't hear them rumbling through the hall. But they must have because when I finally left at noon, all the rooms on the floor had been done and they were just waiting for me. There is a couple with a toddler of I would say almost two, across the hall. I have seen her at the elevator, I've seen her in the lobby, I've never heard her once while in my room, morning or night.The bed is extremely comfortable with feather pillows and mattress topper for softness. The heat/ac works well and is not loud. I have heard extremely little noise from the rooms on the other sides of my walls and have been here three days. I have heard no one else's tv, alarm clock, or phone. And I know there are people in those rooms.For the business traveler, if you worry that you will miss some amenities you are used to at the bigger more expensive chains-don't! The HUGE plusses for business are the FREE high speed internet in every room and the business center where there are computers in case yours dies, also with free internet, and get this folks: FREE printer and fax. No charge at all. The business center is small but so is the hotel so it's not crowded. You needn't go searching for a place or pay to print something, just take your disk or memory stick downstairs and you can print. Oh yes, the little business center is open 24 hours! There is also an iron and ironing board, essential for the business person, and a cordless phone which is nice. The only drawbacks I see for business purposes is the lack of a coffemaker in the room and the fact that room service and the restaurant are not 24-hour and both open at 7 a.m. So, if you have a very early meeting and have to leave before that, at least you can have coffee from the lobby beginning at 5 a.m. But, since there is the minibar you can always walk the half block to Walgreens and buy your breakfast yogurt and apple or danish or whatever and keep it in your room for the next day.For any kind of traveler, the other interesting plusses are the yo-yo, mini etch-a-sketch, cards, and puzzle games in the room. They are open and free to use, you only pay if you take them with you. Also each room is furnished with an oversized umbrella, also free as long as you don't take it home. There are games in the lobby as well and the front desk stocks a large number of board-type games you can borrow for FREE-great for families. And for couples, well, they do offer Twister and well, um, given the size of my particular room the only place I can imagine putting the Twister mat would be um, atop the king-sized bed. Ahem. ok enough of that. There is a small, but adequate fitness room with two treadmills, two recumbant bikes, free weights, and a universal machine. It is well-stocked with towels, reading material, water, and a nice plasma tv on the wall. Everytime I checked in there, it wasn't crowded, maybe one other person. Oh yes, and unlike most OTHER hotel fitness rooms, this one is open 24 hours. And of course, it is FREE. I keep being astounded at the FREE internet and business center. Those bigger expensive chains charge an arm and a leg for these things and dopes that we are, we pay it because we think we need it so badly. Well, now that I know it can be had for FREE.....This hotel is fond of yoga and you may watch the instructional 24-hour yoga channel on the television, do the relaxing yoga poses detailed in the booklet on your desk, or for a very reasonable fee, get a yoga basket with mat/yoga pillow etc from the front desk. For a fee, they also offer in room massage, manicure, pedicure. If traveling with children you may want to ask the size of the rooms that have two double beds as putting a rollaway in the room I have for just one child would be rather cramped, I think. But it could be done. In a few reviews I read here that helped me decide to book the Serrano, people complained of the location-well, everyone who has been to this city a couple of times knows not to walk too far past Taylor St. from Union Square or else you are in the Tenderloin but really, I am female and am quite comfortable walking back to the Serrano at 11 p.m. alone as I am coming from the direction of Union Square. But I know the city pretty well. Yes, there are tons of homeless in the Union Square area and there always have been but they are harmless and this is where the tourist or business person wants to be. They are outside the hotels that cost $400 a night too. I never give them money BUT, when coming back from a business dinner I always ask for a box for my leftovers and as I don't plan to stuff them into my little minibar, I give them to one of the homeless people. I've never had one single person refuse or not be extremely delighted. The hotel restaurant, Ponzu, has a small menu but the asian-fusion dinner entrees are fantastic-they do border on the Thai in terms of spicy so keep that in mind. There are so many other fantastic restaurants at every price range within a few blocks that no one should have any problem finding something to suit.The only complaint I have, is that I did once have breakfast at Ponzu and the service was extremely slow. Perhaps they were short-staffed or something. But, having said that, I must mention that my waitress bent over backwards to explain every tiny delay (&quot;I'm sorry I think we are out of grapefruit juice it will take me a minute to check,&quot; &quot;I apologize, but that table over there has been waiting longer and as soon as I get their meals from the kitchen I will check on how yours is coming,&quot;) and she was constantly freshening my coffee &quot;so it doesn't get cold on you&quot; and so forth. So that made up for the slowness. I write for a living and do tend to go on but really, I've never stayed at a Kimpton hotel before but definitely now want to try them all. The Serrano is rated as a four-star but I would say it deserves a 4.5. I sometimes come to San Francisco for fun, not work, and after staying here I think I would rather spend $149 a night to stay here than to use my frequent guest points and stay at the St. Francis for free. The Serrano is that pleasant!I just can't say enough. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(9178, 9192)",1,0.0,False

There were numerous shops and restaurants in the next street.Although close to busy roads and the Broadway Tunnel, we were never disturbed by traffic noise. I would recommend the Castle Inn to anyone wanting a decent hotel in San Francisco at a reasonable price. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(844, 858)",5,0.0,False

Yes, there are some homeless people walking around, but they do not bother you! They are mostly around the touristy parts (near Union Square, etc.).

The BART drops you off right in front of the hotel, it's about a 3-block walk to catch the trolley/cable car, or you can catch the street car right in front of the hotel to Market and Powell, where you catch the cable car. Also, another tip that we found out while we were there, yes ride the cable cars because of the novelty, but the &quot;F&quot; Street street car goes directly to Fisherman's Wharf and back.

Since I am a Hilton Honors Diamond level member, I was able to enjoy the higher floor and the fitness center without paying extra. The maid service was quite good (don't forget to tip daily if you want VIP treatment). The Urban Tavern restaurant offers interesting fare and some nice wines at usual center city hotel prices. There is a Starbucks in the lobby, priced higher than most of course. The rooftop pool and hot tub looked lovely, but it was too cold outside to take a dip. Those things aside, the downside to this Hilton is threefold. 1. Do not stay at this hotel if you want to use the fitness center and are not a Hilton Diamond or higher as the hotel charges $15 per day for the privelege of entering the Spa fitness center. This is not stated on their website; you just see the little fitness center icon. 2. The neighborhood is really the Tenderloin district, quite a down-and-out neighborhood, not really Union Square area as advertised. Walk to the east when leaving the hotel, and avoid the streets to the left and behind the hotel. 3. If you need to rent a car, the hotel charges a ridiculous upcharge to arrange a rental.

The Castle Inn does offer free parking though, which is a real bonus in SF! Parking throughout SF is difficult, pricey &amp; hard to find. For this trip, we purchased 3-day Muni Passes at the airport when we arrived, &amp; used those to travel the city on busses &amp; cable cars - a good value if you don't mind the challenges of riding city busses! Make sure you get a bus route map when you purchase your Muni Passes!Rooms at the Castle are clean &amp; comfortable - not fancy or large, but decent &amp; reasonably priced compared to many SF hotels. Our 2-bed room had a hairdryer, small fridge, coffee maker, free cable tv &amp; table with 2 large chairs. Our 3rd floor room overlooked a lovely yard of trees next door &amp; we could just see a bit of the Golden Gate Bridge in the distance. There is a nice little continental breakfast (coffee, cocoa, yogurt, fruit, pastries, granola bars) in the lobby. The best feature of the Castle Inn is our favorite hostess, Versa! She is always so pleasant, accomodating &amp; knowledgeable with good advice about the city. They also gave us a chart showing busses/stop locations to go to various tourist locations throughout the city.

We have stayed there on 2 occasions &amp; the wonderful staff, convenient location, &amp; clean, quiet rooms keep us coming back! Located at Broadway &amp; Van Ness, Castle Inn is in a nice neighborhood with drug store, grocery, cafes &amp; cute shops within close walking distance. It's also right on the bus line &amp; is a straight shot down to Fisherman's Wharf. My dad &amp; I stayed for 4 quiet &amp; comfortable nights. We rented a car on our previous trip, but found that with a little planning, getting around on the bus was an easier &amp; less costly option. The Castle Inn does offer free parking though, which is a real bonus in SF! Parking throughout SF is difficult, pricey &amp; hard to find. For this trip, we purchased 3-day Muni Passes at the airport when we arrived, &amp; used those to travel the city on busses &amp; cable cars - a good value if you don't mind the challenges of riding city busses! Make sure you get a bus route map when you purchase your Muni Passes!Rooms at the Castle are clean &amp; comfortable - not fancy or large, but decent &amp; reasonably priced compared to many SF hotels. Our 2-bed room had a hairdryer, small fridge, coffee maker, free cable tv &amp; table with 2 large chairs. Our 3rd floor room overlooked a lovely yard of trees next door &amp; we could just see a bit of the Golden Gate Bridge in the distance. There is a nice little continental breakfast (coffee, cocoa, yogurt, fruit, pastries, granola bars) in the lobby. The best feature of the Castle Inn is our favorite hostess, Versa! She is always so pleasant, accomodating &amp; knowledgeable with good advice about the city. They also gave us a chart showing busses/stop locations to go to various tourist locations throughout the city. Castle Inn also has a nice website worth checking out.If you want a clean, decent room to sleep in at night &amp; a hot shower in the morning without a lot of pricey luxury, the Castle Inn is a little gem of a motel in a convenient location to get to the tourist attractions easily.

We could hear every conversation going on in the hallway, as well as housekeeping knocking on doors first thing in the morning. We were asked multiple times by housekeeping when they would be able to get in to clean our room - even when we had the 'do not disturb' sign on our door. The actual housekeeping staff was very friendly, but due to the lack of soundproofing in the room, we got to hear them being friendly to every hotel guest on the floor.

NO wi-fi in the rooms, even for a fee? AND, $15 to use the gym? To run on a treadmill?! Seriously? The random additional charges were absolutely ridiculous.

We took a short cab ride to the Embarcadero BART station to get to the game. The valet was very helpful in getting our cab and the taxi fare was relatively inexpensive. The location is within walking distance to everything in the Fisherman's Wharf area. Our room was very nice, it was in a recently remodeled section and everything was very clean and new. The bed was very comfortable. There was a large flat-screen TV and internet access. Staff was courteous and accommodating. We did receive a bit of a shock when we looked at our hotel bill upon check-out. We expected a valet parking fee because every hotel has a fee for parking. However, a fee of $45.00 per day was added along with $6.33 in parking tax on top of that. This parking fee was not disclosed at check-in. Unfortunately, there are few options if you are driving and plan on parking. There is no street parking available so if you plan on staying, be sure to factor in this $51.33 fee per day into your hotel budget. ANSWERNOTFOUND",its convenient,"(89, 103)",2,0.0,False

The McAllister side entry of the hotel has a handful of homeless/shady people constantly loitering close by and the street itself always smells like urine.When I checked in, the hotel staff were friendly and helpful. They tried hard to accommodate their guests. I have only nice things to say about the people who work here. The hotel itself, on the other hand, is far from reproach. While the lobby area looks decent, the rooms and hallways are old and sorta dirty. They really need to change the carpet.Let's start with the problems for the rooms, in order of worst to least annoyance:1) LOUD and CONSTANT knocking sound from the radiator. It sounds like you're sleeping in a construction zone with someone banging against metal pipes with a hammer. I called the front desk to report the problem twice and was told that there's nothing they could do about the radiator noise on the 2nd floor. However, they were able to move me to the 7th floor where the noise level was extant, but much more bearable. The hotel does not turn on the heat until 8 PM and turns it off at 7AM. Their 100 years old heating system needs to be upgraded to 21st century machines.2) Non-working wireless internet. Although I read online that this hotel does not have wireless, they did. I was able to connect to the hotel wireless but could not get internet. Several calls to the front desk produced no result so they gave me an 866 (supposed to be toll-free and free of charge, see complaint #3) number to reach the internet provider directly. I sat on the phone with the support desk staff for 20 minutes while he walked me through every step to troubleshoot the problem. It was then determined that the problem lies in the routers of the hotel, not the user, and that internet will not be available for an indefinite amount of time. Basically, the hotel had no free internet access for guests.3) Phone charge. When I received the 1-866-xxx-xxxx number to contact the front desk, I specifically asked whether they will charge me to make this call. Their answer was no. When I checked out of the hotel, they charged me $1 for connection fee because I made a call using their phone. I argued for a little but decided to just give them a buck instead of wasting my time. This was a completely unfair charge considering that I was double-deceived and still unable to resolve the internet problem. I should not be charge to contact their own vendor to rectify an issue for which Renoir Hotel should be responsible.4) Baby towels. The hotel's bath towels are rough and is about the size of a small wash cloth or half the width of a regular towel.5) Hard, lumpy bed. Yes, the bed seemed clean but it was hard and lumpy.6) 13&quot; color TV with cable but a dead remote7) There is no air conditioning, just a fan. I don't think A/C is really necessary in SF because you could just open the window to get some cool air. But would I want the urine smell on McAllister street to get into my room?Overall, I think the issue lies in the hotel owner and their management issues, not of their staff.

It's an older building with a bit of charm, but everything was clean and the rooms even included a mini fridge and microwave.The location is right in the heart of the city in a cute and safe neighborhood.

This was a special occasion which we mentioned when booking online and a bottle of champagne awaited us on arrival. The breakfast on each floor is simple but nice. The staff are friendly and helpful.The complimentary glass of wine in the cosy hotel bar is a nice touch. We ate once in the restaurant and it was excellent.Our second stay was a suite situated at the front of the hotel overlooking the main street.

They recommended some great restaurants that were within walking distance. We felt very safe in the neighborhood. They do not have any parking, but there are many lots down the street. We paid $10 for overnight parking a few blocks away.Breakfast was good: muffins, bagels, juice. Nothing extrodinary, but definatley above average.

If you are coming to SF without a car, this is probably one of the best places to stay. It is next to the Powell Street Station so you can catch the MUNI or the BART without a problem. I was on this trip without a car, but parking each day is probably around $45, which seems outrageously expensive, but in all honestly, this is average for a SF hotel, especially in the Union Square area. There are parking lots within walking distance that are cheaper, but since I did not use any, I cannot recommend a specific one. If you're taking the BART in from SFO, it will cost you less than $6 to get to the hotel.Since it is close to this hub of public transportation (including the famous cable cars), and surrounded by the major shopping area of the city, you should be aware that there is a lot of city street noise through the night. If you are a light sleeper, you will need the highest floor possible to get away from the hustle &amp; bustle. If you are used to it, or can sleep through anything, you probably wouldn't even notice the noises. However, the hotel does provide ear plugs if you need them.Some people seem confused by the lobby being on the second floor, which is understandable, but don't forget this is SF and buildings are built into the hills. There are signs all over the place to direct you to the correct place to check in and elevators to get you to the second floor. There's also a great staff to assist you if you come in on the ground level, which is still under renovations.

Also, if you are on a lower level, do not expect a great view of the bay from your room like they feature on their website. You are, after all, surrounded by other tall buildings, block after block.

According to the website, every evening, hors d'oeuvres would be available from Postrio, the restaurant located in the lobby and a well-known restaurant at that.

We had a week long reservation for a queen room (all that was available at the time) and needed one night before our week started. Having looked at the photos on the website we noticed that the beds seemed really &quot;square (in our experience that means hard) and the pillows very flat in the standard rooms so we upgraded for our single night stay. Our king bed was the most comfortable we have slept on, the pillows great and the room had a pool view with a balcony (this was a premium room for $60 upgrade). I wouldn't say the staff isn't friendly, they are just &quot;job focused&quot; and not people focused. They don't make conversation easily, but after a week we managed to get smiles and a few sentences out of them. If you ask for information about the city, you do get it in a concise sentence which is what some people may consider the rudeness, but really, most people we ran into in San Francisco were the same way-not very conversational. When it came time to check into our &quot;real&quot; room with RCI the clerk asked if we would just like to stay where we were (bed upgrade and room upgrade) and that it would just be the same $60 extra per night. We agreed, paying 60 a night for a hotel in San Francisco was unheard of. Sure we could have moved to our standard room and stayed for free, but this was vacation! All in all we liked the hotel, especially the central location and nearness to the California St.cable cars just 4 blocks to the north. One warning, DON'T go walking from the hotel to Union Square via Geary or O'Farrell-this area is very dicey and really looked like the set of a New York cop show.

We had a week long reservation for a queen room (all that was available at the time) and needed one night before our week started. Having looked at the photos on the website we noticed that the beds seemed really &quot;square (in our experience that means hard) and the pillows very flat in the standard rooms so we upgraded for our single night stay. Our king bed was the most comfortable we have slept on, the pillows great and the room had a pool view with a balcony (this was a premium room for $60 upgrade). I wouldn't say the staff isn't friendly, they are just &quot;job focused&quot; and not people focused. They don't make conversation easily, but after a week we managed to get smiles and a few sentences out of them. If you ask for information about the city, you do get it in a concise sentence which is what some people may consider the rudeness, but really, most people we ran into in San Francisco were the same way-not very conversational. When it came time to check into our &quot;real&quot; room with RCI the clerk asked if we would just like to stay where we were (bed upgrade and room upgrade) and that it would just be the same $60 extra per night. We agreed, paying 60 a night for a hotel in San Francisco was unheard of. Sure we could have moved to our standard room and stayed for free, but this was vacation! All in all we liked the hotel, especially the central location and nearness to the California St.cable cars just 4 blocks to the north. One warning, DON'T go walking from the hotel to Union Square via Geary or O'Farrell-this area is very dicey and really looked like the set of a New York cop show.

We had a 3rd floor king w/ city view , nice view however if you open the windows the noise from Lombard Street is very loud , once closed noise barley audiable.

The lady on the line say its because they we a high end hotel therefore other departments took care of such things. Told us the accounting department will call us. They did not after two days!

The only other boutique hotel we've stayed at in San Francisco is the Serrano, which for some reason we were able to book amazingly cheap rooms for in 2007 (had a look at Serrano for this trip and rates were well over $200 a night). So with the Serrano as our only point of comparison, I'd say the Hotel Rex is a good value boutique hotel for San Franciso that might not knock your socks off, but for the money has enough going for it to still make it a great place to stay. Our room was stylish with contemporary linens and funky framed art, if a little on the 'cozy' side. The bathroom was also a bit small but nice enough. Room was a bit stuffy but we opened up our window (so great to be able to do that!) and used the fan that was provided in the room and I slept like a rock both nights. The window was facing the street, but we were far enough up that noise wasn't really a problem (especially with the fan going). The location is great - very central and always felt safe walking around the area. In terms of service, found everybody friendly and helpful enough, but nothing extraordinary (I think that was what had really 'wowed' us about the Serrano...)What I liked most: the fun, funky decor and being able to open our window.What I liked least: It felt a bit 'cramped' everywhere - in the hallways and the room.

(Good Points) The hotel is located right near the wharf area which would be a plus for most people. It is only a short walk to the cable cars and trolley. The hotel is new and shows no wear and tear yet. The breakfast is the typical Holiday Inn Select breakfast which I believe to be one of the best around. The hotel staff is friendly and helpful. They put out fruit on the counter in the afternoon.  (Needing improvement or that which you may want to be forewarned of) We needed two rooms. The one my son and his friend stayed in was a typical two bed room of adequate size. The one my wife and I stayed in was really small (477 I think). It reminded me of some of the smallish european rooms we have stayed in. It was adequate, but should not have been priced as high as the others. Parking your car here is 32 dollars a pop for one night. I consider that too high even for a large city. I believe you can park it cheaper at some of the local lots.

We were very satisfied and were lucky to have Varsa onsight the entire time of our stay as she was genuinely friendly andinformative about how to see the sights in the city, where to buy themuni pass, etc. Many tourists near the wharf asked where I got the convienent, small map she provided and she also provided another one for my young son who loves to have his own copy. This is not a fancy place- furnishings were on par with Days Inn type chain but the rate was great for our family (as cheap as $99/night during the week if you book directly from their website) and included free parking and free continental breakfast which easily saved us $400 plus from the places I was looking at near the wharf area. We had room 225 which was midway back from street with rooms above and below and although we could hear street and other noise as we had the air conditioning off during our stay, it wasn't excessive nor did it intrude our sleep. You are in a city. My kids loved to go to the office to retrieve a tray of food in the morning and talk to Varsa (you have to eat in your room as the office isn't big enough to eat there) and we felt the place was safe enough to let them go off by themselves this distance. There are restaurants and Walgreens, etc. within a half block on Polk Street which was convienent but not intrusive. We got popcorn and drinks to store in fridge/microwave provided in each room. The beds were rather soft but it was very clean and the linens were better than average. Enjoyed staying away from the massesdown near the wharf but within 2 blocks of the cable car or a 20 min walk to this area. Walked around at night and never felt uneasy. Again, Varsa was very kind- provided postcard stamps and looked up an address for us on the internet and the hours of business for another attraction. We arrived rather late (after the posted office hours of 11pm) but had called a week ahead to confirm that we would be accomodated and also enroute and they waited up for us. It was a great choice for our first visit to SF and would have no qualms aboutstaying at the Castle again for this princess! Thank you trip advisorcontributors for this find!

We were very satisfied and were lucky to have Varsa onsight the entire time of our stay as she was genuinely friendly andinformative about how to see the sights in the city, where to buy themuni pass, etc. Many tourists near the wharf asked where I got the convienent, small map she provided and she also provided another one for my young son who loves to have his own copy. This is not a fancy place- furnishings were on par with Days Inn type chain but the rate was great for our family (as cheap as $99/night during the week if you book directly from their website) and included free parking and free continental breakfast which easily saved us $400 plus from the places I was looking at near the wharf area. We had room 225 which was midway back from street with rooms above and below and although we could hear street and other noise as we had the air conditioning off during our stay, it wasn't excessive nor did it intrude our sleep. You are in a city. My kids loved to go to the office to retrieve a tray of food in the morning and talk to Varsa (you have to eat in your room as the office isn't big enough to eat there) and we felt the place was safe enough to let them go off by themselves this distance. There are restaurants and Walgreens, etc. within a half block on Polk Street which was convienent but not intrusive. We got popcorn and drinks to store in fridge/microwave provided in each room. The beds were rather soft but it was very clean and the linens were better than average. Enjoyed staying away from the massesdown near the wharf but within 2 blocks of the cable car or a 20 min walk to this area. Walked around at night and never felt uneasy. Again, Varsa was very kind- provided postcard stamps and looked up an address for us on the internet and the hours of business for another attraction. We arrived rather late (after the posted office hours of 11pm) but had called a week ahead to confirm that we would be accomodated and also enroute and they waited up for us. It was a great choice for our first visit to SF and would have no qualms aboutstaying at the Castle again for this princess! Thank you trip advisorcontributors for this find!

This hotel was great, and I recommend it to anyone. It is centrally located 3 blocks from Union Square and is clean and quiet. The Serrano Hotel, by contrast, although also a Kimpton Hotel, was very disappointing. My negative experience began with the reservationist who booked a King Room for us, I doubly confirmed this because I knew that the city was extremely booked at this time. When we checked in, the woman at the front desk was thoroughly overwhelmed and seemed anxious. She was very rushed and curt. Also, when we arrived we found our room to have only a queen sized bed instead of a king, and the room felt so cramped we were feeling clausterphobic as soon as we walked in. The bathroom was clean, in good working order, and had nice ammenities and fixtures but it too felt cramped. The room we stayed in was on the 4th floor and it was rectangular in shape, the foot of the queen sized bed reached the wall, not leaving much room around it. The comforter has loose threads and appeared worn, and the sheets looked dusty and had lint on them. It was extremely noisy in the area from construction and the windows did not block out any of the noise. We immediately called the front desk to inquire, and they left us on hold for so long that the line disconnected, and when I called again, another woman said the original person was on hold with someone else and she would have them call us back. However, we did not receive a call back for ten minutes so we decided to get out of the room and go to the front desk immediately.When we inquired about why we were given a queen room, we were told that all the king rooms had been booked. I assured her that we had booked a king room and she said there was nothing she could do about it. When I told her that we would like to check out and find another hotel, she said that was fine but that our credit card would be charged anyways for the stay and that there was nothing she could do about it. When I asked to speak with the original reservationist, he did some research and told us that they had no king rooms available, but that one might open up later, but they couldn't promise anything. I explained that he had not told us this from the beginning and that we should be able to leave without getting charged, since it had been their mistake. He finally said the manager would take care of us and let me go. Pam, the fron desk manager, apologized profusely and I overheard her on the phone booking restaurant reservations for a guest and she seemed wonderfully helpful. She was the only positive experience in the 45 minutes I spent in the hotel. All of that being said, if you are willing to spend $215+ during peak season for a small queen room that has a Victorian feel in the lobby, then these are the benefits:*4 blocks to Union Square*Attentive Bellman (At least the one who was there at the time, he was the only one who asked if he could be of any help)*Game tables in the lobby, a fireplace and a restaurant (we did not eat there)*Some of the higher rooms may have nice views, we were told that they did by the reservationist because they have more than 17 floors*Pam, the front desk manager, who seemed very interested in making everyone's stay a great one*Updated bathroom*Victorian feelI would definitely recommend the Hotel Palomar over Serrano, we paid less for more space, better customer service, and awesome amenities.

Great service!The had refreshments in the lobby, which varied depending on the the time of day. I tried out the pink lemonade and it was great. Very refreshing on a hot day.The location is awesome.

In my opinion it's the personal comfort level, the suitability of the accomodations for your purpose as well as exemplary customer service, the kind of service that anticipates your needs and fulfills them graciously.My business partner and I meet in SF several times a year for a few days. Three years ago we lucked upon the Hotel Rex. The remodeling wasn't complete and things were a little crazy but our room was perfect cozy for hanging out and business planning - spacious, with arty literary furnishings - and the staff bent over backwards to compensate for any inconvenience. We had forgotten toothpaste and there was none at the front desk - oh well - a knock on our door came shortly after and there stood the hotel night manager who had brought us his own toothpaste!We were hooked! Since then, remodeling complete, the Rex has turned into our cosmopolitan home-away-from-home- we have stayed there 10+ times. The restaurant is fabulous, the menu is smallish, but the food is impeccable; the bar and downstairs lounge perfect for relaxing and entertaining clients; the staff has had very little turnover and they remember us by name and treat us like family.The Rex is a boutique hotel - not a slick, high-end, luxury hotel. If that's what you crave, try The W or the St. Francis - both are wonderful.

In my opinion it's the personal comfort level, the suitability of the accomodations for your purpose as well as exemplary customer service, the kind of service that anticipates your needs and fulfills them graciously.My business partner and I meet in SF several times a year for a few days. Three years ago we lucked upon the Hotel Rex. The remodeling wasn't complete and things were a little crazy but our room was perfect cozy for hanging out and business planning - spacious, with arty literary furnishings - and the staff bent over backwards to compensate for any inconvenience. We had forgotten toothpaste and there was none at the front desk - oh well - a knock on our door came shortly after and there stood the hotel night manager who had brought us his own toothpaste!We were hooked! Since then, remodeling complete, the Rex has turned into our cosmopolitan home-away-from-home- we have stayed there 10+ times. The restaurant is fabulous, the menu is smallish, but the food is impeccable; the bar and downstairs lounge perfect for relaxing and entertaining clients; the staff has had very little turnover and they remember us by name and treat us like family.The Rex is a boutique hotel - not a slick, high-end, luxury hotel. If that's what you crave, try The W or the St. Francis - both are wonderful. But if you want a place to kick your shoes off that's close to a perfect location for ambling around The City that will leave you refreshed and happy, the Hotel Rex is the place to be.

What a wonderful place! We booked a queen room, but got a small suite at the front of the hotel - the bed was a little smaller, but it had a separate sitting room with a sofa, chair and desk and a second plasma flat screen tv. But the great thing about this inn is the extras, which are offered free of charge. First, breakfast is served each morning until 10 or so on each floor on the third and fifth floors parlours. The quality is good, with fresh high quality pastries and coffee as well as cereal, boiled eggs, bagels, cheese, fruit, tea, etc. It is served on china and cloth napkins with nice breakfast trays to take back to your room and small tables to eat in the parlour. Also, there are fresh apples and cookies in each parlour all day long. At 5 or so, they set out multiple bottles of wine with really good cheese and fruit and stemware and napkins again and welcome you to a drink before you go out to dinner. There are also other cold drinks set out. All free of charge. There is wireless internet available free of charge, as well as a small business center. At night, the maid leaves bottled water and chocolate. At the end of the weekend, we had not a single incidental charge. The staff is young and enthusiastic and they are genuinely helpful. Be warned - this is an inn more than a hotel - it is narrow and the hallways are narrow as well. The elevator is small and there is no grand lobby, just a number of small parlours. But the rooms are tastefully done with good linens and the furniture and tvs are of good quality. There is no noise from room to room, and our room was right outside the parlour where folks on our floor had breakfast. There is some noise from the street - it is 500 feet off Powell and those streetcars do make noise, so if you really like it quiet, get a room in back. The rooms in front offer a nice view to compensate for the noise. In the last five years, we have stayed at the St. Francis (fancy, but not great service), the Fairmont (grand old gem, but so big), the Villa Forence (really nice boutique hotel), the Hotel Griffon (great location, unfriendly staff) and the Holiday Inn Gateway (utilitarian, no frills). This was by far my favorite. It is for those who like privacy and value. If you want a grand lobby, you will have to cross the street to the St. Francis.
