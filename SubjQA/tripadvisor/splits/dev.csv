I got a great weekend rate at $169 a night. LOCATION: The location could not be any better. We took the BART and walked 4 blocks (10 minutes) to the hotel. Just make sure you don't have too much luggage. The hotel is also within walking distance of Union Square and Chinatown. There are also Muni lines and cable car lines very close by.HOTEL:I knew that it was an older hotel, but I guess I expected the rooms to be nicer. It is very clean, but there was no &quot;wow&quot; factor that I have seen at other hotels like Novotel Singapore or Venetian in Vegas. It was a regular room with regular t.v. with nice amenities but nothing ultra-modern. The bed was very comfortable. The rooms were very quiet, although you could hear some hallway noise, but nothing from outside the building. I guess that is why they are not considered a 5 star hotel. Minus one star for the room.SERVICE:The service was very good overall. Check in was quick and all the staff were extremely friendly. We are a select guest, so we get morning beverage service (you are supposed to get a card outside your room and you hang it out with your beverages). Since this is our first stay, we had no idea how this worked. We never got a card and got no beverages in the morning. When I called the front desk, they forwarded me to room service, and I got my beverages. I also told front desk that I didn't get a beverage card, just a room service, when they asked if I hung it outside. Well, for a #1 rated Tripadvisor and 4 star hotel, I would expect a select guest beverage card the following night, but no. So, minus one star for that. However, when I wanted coffee the next morning at 11:00 a.m. (they have a pot of coffee in Bob's every morning until 10:00 a.m.), the staff got me one, so add one star.Overall, this is a great hotel with great service. I can see why it is not 5 stars, but the service really makes it above the rest.HOTEL TIPS:Get free water and fruit in the fitness room. There is also free fruit in the afternoon and free lemonade in the lobby. There is free coffee in the morning at Bob's bar until 10:00 a.m. But, you get free beverage service delivered to your room if you sign up as a selected guest.RESTAURANT TIPS:We found two great restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. Both are highly rated on yelp. The first is Bix. It is on Gold St., which is about 5 blocks north of Montgomery (10 minutes walk). It's in a small alley, and the food is awesome and moderately priced (entrees $25 to 35 range). Their appetizers are incredible, and the atmosphere is very nice. The second is Great Eastern in Chinatown for dim sum. This place is located on Jackson St. by Kearny. It is very clean compared to the other Chinatown places, and you order off of a menu with pictures (no carts). Service is a bit slow, but if you are looking for an adventure in Chinatown, definitely try dim sum there. Go early (before 11:00) to avoid the crazy crowds!

Our room was very elegantly decorated, very clean and the bed very, very comfortable. The maid service was also great. The concierge, in addition, was ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL! The front desk staff seemed a little frustrated at their computer system, but they were very good to us. When I return to San Fran in a couple of months on business I will surely stay there again. **I will say, though, that the only reason I'm giving my review 4 stars and not 5 stars has to do with the porter. We dealt with two porters: an extremely kind and helpful gentleman from east Africa and a snotty, 20-something white kid. My partner is from Latin America and has a slight Spanish accent. He is, however, Ivy League educated and speaks perfect English. The 20-something porter was so insultingly patronizing to my partner that I became rather upset.

It was my second visit to SFO but the first for everyone else. With 2 small children we wanted to stay somewhere central with easy access to transport. We were not disappointed from that respect with the Handlery. Shops galore and the cable car practically at the door step.We were in a club room so after checking in, the easiest access from and to our room was from the O'Farrell St entrance. There were renovations being undertaken at the time we stayed but we were unaffected aside from the fact we had to walk through the basement to get from the lobby to our room on the other side of the hotel.Check in was easy and staff very friendly. Our room was comfortable. Even though there were 4 of us and we had a lot of luggage given we were travelling with 2 small children, we did not feel too cramped and it was useful having a small dressing table just outside the bathroom. Our room looked over O'Farrell St and we did get a bit of street noise, including music and singing from the buskers until about 11pm to 12am but it did not really bother us and our children were able to sleep through it. Our room was just outside the lift though and they were noisy. But again we were not too bothered by it but be aware of it if you a light sleeper and noise sensitive. The beds were comfortable. The bathroom small but adequate.Our coffee maker was not working but was replaced very promptly with a new one. Our room missed being serviced on one day we stayed but clean towels were delivered to us quickly once we called for them. We also got a letter of apology from John Handlery regarding this in response to a feedback form we completed. With our 1 year old we needed to get boiled water and to be able to heat up food from time to time and the staff were very accommodating about that. We were able to access the staffroom to use the microwave.We did not find the concierge very friendly or approachable but the bell hops were very helpful and accommodating.We intended to, but did not get around to trying out the Daily Grill but there are lots of cafes and restaurants close by to try and many at reasonable prices. For breakfast Loris Diner is a good choice (we went back a few times) as is Cafe Mason. Both are just around the corner from the hotel. We had breakfast at Lefty O'Doulls one day but would not back. Food was below average compared to what else was nearby and service was not great. We tried to get into Dotties True Blue Cafe on Jones St given great reviews it got on TripAdvisor but there was a long line outside so we did not wait as we had to 2 children who were very hungry at that stage.We did a lot of walking and our 5 year old managed to keep up pretty well. If you are travelling with kids, Zeum and the Exploratorium are a must. Zeum is in walking distance (about 15 mins) and the Exploratorium accessible by bus. We went to the Aquarium which was good but not really that big and to be honest, if you have been to Kelly Tarlton's in Auckland, the Sydney Aquarium or the Aquarium in Vancouver, you won't really miss anything by giving the Pier 39 Aquarium a miss. You may want to go in any event though if you have kids as they do have some touching pools where you can touch starfish and some fish.We bought the 7 day City Pass which was very handy, and definitely worthwhile if you intend to hop on and off the cable car as otherwise the one ride or daily passes are relatively expensive.The cable car turning area at Powell and Market Streets always seemed to be busy with long lines. It seemed less of a wait at the cable car turning area at the end of the Powell Hyde line.Catch the cable car to the top of Lombard St - it stops literally right at the top where pretty gardens are - rather than approach from the bottom as walking down is definitely easier than walking up! It's easy to catch the cable car back to the city from the bottom of the street.Book your Alcatraz tickets at least a couple of days in advance even in the low season. It was not peak season when we went but we still had to wait for a couple of days before there were available spaces.We did a Wok Wizz walking tour of Chinatown - our guide was very informative and gave us lots of good tips of places to go for people wanting to purchase or see particular things. The tour included a stop at the fortune cookie factory on Ross Street (I think) where we could see how the cookies were made, sample them and of course buy. It was USD5 for a big bag. Very yummy. If you are heading to Chinatown and looking for the more authentic stores, ie the ones where the locals buy their fresh fruit and vegetables and groceries etc, head to Stockton St and Jackson St. Grant St, the street with the Chinatown gate is more for tourists. Cheap T-shirts galore - about USD2 or 3 each. Ghiradelli Square and Hyde St Pier is a good place to spend a relaxing morning or afternoon, especially if you are interested in historic ships and maritime matters. It is also where the Ghiradelli chocolate factory and shops are. Although we had 7 days in SFO, we took things reasonably slowly since we were travelling with kids, but we could probably have easily spent another few days, or even a week, to see some of the other things we didn't get to!One other thing to be aware of is that it is pretty cool in SFO, apparently at any time of the year. Even though it was mid Spring when we went, we found it at times cooler than it was back in Auckland (where it was mid Autumn). Layers are definitely recommended and I would make sure you have a fleece or similar, especially for the kids if you are going to be down near hthe pier/wharf areas. Having said that, if you forget to pack them, there are plenty of places to buy them at relatively cheap prices.For non-Americans and people who have not been to the States before, it might be useful to know that pharmacies like Walgreens, which can be found all over central city, sell almost anything that you would want from a supermarket at reasonable prices so a good place to go to stock up on bottled water, snacks and the like.

Pool/spa area on 4th floor looked nice though we only walked through to take a peek.

Since I used to live in SF and travel their quite frequently for work, I am quite familiar with the city and knew we would want to stay in union square (as my boyfriend has never been there and this is the best &quot;touristy&quot; spot). I usually prefer to stay at the Sir Francis Drake or the Westin St. Francis but both were overbooked. I was left with the Clift and Hotel Nikko. I definiately made the wrong choice even though I had heard good things about the lounge and restaurant. Since I have stayed at the Morgan (NYC) several times I assumed we would have a pleasant experience and I LOVE Asia de Cuba in NYC. I was wrong!  When we arrived at the Clift, the doorman did not even open the door or even aknowledge our pressence. Check-in was smooth but the girl was certainly rushing us and annoyed with any questions. Our original plan was to spend our first night with dinner at Asia De Cuba and start off with some early evening cocktails at the Redwood Room. BIG MISTAKE. Upon check-in we asked if we needed reservations for the Redwood Room. The girl gave us some &quot;preferred customer&quot; cards of some sort which she explained would get us right in with no problem. We approached the hostess at about 730 pm. There were a couple of guys in front of us whom the hostess was assisting. As we patiently waited, a large group came up behind us. The matron of the group approached the hostess - cutting in front of everyone else AND interrupting the conversation between the hostess and the 2 guys. Rather than telling this RUDE woman to go stand in line actually assisted her! The guys in front of us looked apalled and we were infuriated. Once it was finally our turn (like that mattered to the hostess) she very rudely told us we couldnt come in without a reservation. She said she had people arriving at 9 pm. We explained we just wanted ONE pre-dinner cocktail. At this point she got even more rude. At this point we decided this was NOT a place we wanted to spend out money anyways. They obviously dont care about their actual guests! The scene was horrible anyways. I dont think there was a patron under the age of 65 in the entire bar.... so much for a &quot;hip&quot; bar scene. We tried to complain to a manager but he was too busy having a personal conversation with one of the doormen. We decided our money is better spent elsewhere and opted against dinner in the hotel. We had a lovely meal in the Marina district then went on to drinks at Matrix where our patronage was appreciated and our drinks were not accompanied with a side of rudeness. I might also point out the martinis are $8 at Matrix as opposed to the overpriced drinks Redwood Room with serve you along with their snooty attitude. We are from LA so we are no strangers to attitude but this was just plain RUDE.  Aside from the horrible experience our first night, the hotel lobby is quite nice. The rooms are VERY small and somewhat dirty. The bathroom is appalling - dirty towels, the fan doesnt work, no standing room. On our final day, the anger from night one had worn off slightly (probably because we spent as little time in the hotel as possible). We were packing our stuff and relaxing from a morning of shopping. The day before, housekeeping entered our room even though we had the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign on the door. Since nothing was taken we ignored it. Now here we are, a mere hour from escaping the Clift, when there is a knock at the door...housekeeping. I explain we are leaving at 1 (check out time) and to please respect the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign. 15 minutes later, another knock at the door. It is the housekeeper AGAIN. I tell her &quot;we are still here&quot; and remind her of our departure time. Sure enough, another knock at the door and who could it be? The SAME housekeeper. At this point we are so frustrated my boyfriend tells her to wait outside and we gather all our stuff (half packed and all). They clearly wanted us gone so we sprinted to the elevator checked out and left the Clift behind.  Trust me, the Clift offers NOTHING to validate such horrible attitudes and behavior. I had high hopes for this place and if they had impressed me, I would have considered staying there on my monthly business trips up to SF. Forget it. I will definately tell everyone I know NOT to stay here and I will probably never stay at the Morgan again either just because of the Clift affiliation. Trust me, you are better off at the Sir Francis Drake or the Westin. At least they know you exist there and are gracious for your patronage. My advice to the Clift, perhaps you should remember that you are serving your guests not vice versa. Thank you for putting a stain on an otherwise lovely trip.

I would recommend making reservations at the restaurant as it quickly filled up every night and we were turned away frequently - I heard one traveller get into a heated discussion about never being able to get in for dinner.My only recommendation would be to ask for a room that's not on the first floor, or a room with a view of the garden. The street noise was pretty bad and we were woken up a few times because of this. There were a few homeless people who would sit on the street outside and make a ton of noise throughout the night. Also, the restaurant drags their tables and chairs inside at midnight or later and then outside at 7:00am. It makes a lot of noise too - just a tip.Anyway, we loved it at this hotel and were very happy. Last word of caution - if you're going to San Francisco, don't rent a car.

Our room had one double bed and it almost filled the room - that was fine with us as we don't need a lot of space. We actually don't spend much time in the room anyway - other than sleeping. The room was very clean, the bathroom was very clean and it had a good shower, good lighting, hot water and lots of water pressure. The bed was comfortable. Our window looked out to an inner courtyard, but mostly we could just see hotel walls and windows around the courtyard - not a good view, but that is not what we were after. The staff were all very helpful and courteous. We used the adjacent Daily Grill for our breakfasts and it was very good - food and service. We would definitely book here again and would readily recommend the hotel to others. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1178, 1192)",5,0.0,False

My husband and I spent a month travelling around California in September and early October. San Francisco was one of our early stops. Supposedly it was to be the highlight at the end of a relaxing 10 day trip up the PCH before we headed off to Lake Tahoe and then Yosemite and Death Valley. Figuring we'd be exhausted after moving on every 2 days we booked the Handlery for 4 days. I've visited San Francisco twice before - but the most recent time was 7 yrs ago. And BOY has the city changed! When booking a hotel I avoided Fishermans Wharf area because it was a real dive the last time I was in the city. Instead, I remembered how central and relatively nice Union Sq was. I read trip advisor reviews and the Handlery seemed to be a good option at the time - plus I managed to get a park and pay deal, which when parking is around $40 a day is a big saving across 4 days.Clearly 7 years is a very very long time. I found the city reversed! Sure Fishermans Wharf is now a not very authentic tourist area but compared to Unions Sq it seemed slightly more pleasant - and generally the hotels were a good deal cheaper. Unions Sq was wall to wall beggars - literally one every 10 feet on the sidewalks and had an overriding stench of urine. I work in London, UK so I'm not exactly immune to city life but this has to be the worst case of vagrancy in any city I have ever visited - and the San Francisco I knew 7-10 yrs ago was nothing like this. Now, I have no idea if this is a real problem, although some guide books advised that the beggars ship themselves in from the suburbs and this is their job. I have no idea but the city needs to do something - both to clear up the city and to help those in need.Anyway, as for the Handlery. Well, the staff were mostly nice although not very helpful - except the guy who worked on the front door, i think he was called a &quot;loss prevention officer&quot;! He was really great - the only employee in the hotel with an ounce of initiative. He seemed to continually keep an eye out for people who were needing attention and then just help them even though it was clearly not his job. For example, one day the bellhops desk was completely unattended yet he came over, asked us the problem - which was just that we wanted to drop off some laundry (another rant by the way - $4.50 for a pair of underwear? I don't think so!) and off he went with our laundry and came back a minute later with the receipt. I really wish I remembered his name because somebody should give the guy a raise. The concierge on the other hand should be given a talking to - useless and rude.The first room we were given on the 7th floor was tiny, dark and right by the lift shaft - a bit like a cell. I immediately went to the front desk and to their credit they did find us another room on the 10th floor which was nicer - although still a disappointment. I don't know why but the rooms just don't live up to their pictures. It's really weird - we just got our photos back and my husband and I have been showing them to people and they're like what's wrong with it - it looks nice. I agree, it does in the pictures but in the flesh - No. The inch of dust on the skirting board didn't help. The bath towels are the size of what in the UK we call hand towels! Also, I'm sorry but someone needs to tell the hotel that they are based in a city - not having drapes or blackout blinds is insane. The only window covering was a wood slat venetian blind which hung away from the window so people across the way - or indeed the workmen working on the exterior of the building could see inside - not great when you want to get dressed. Plus at night the light streaming in is quite disturbing. Oddly, the noise other people have complained about didn't bother me at all - probably because on the 10th floor we were far removed from it.I definitely won't be going back to this hotel and I would actively recommend against it. Frankly, I'm not sure I'll be heading back to San Francisco any time soon either. Who knows, maybe in 7 yrs it'll be back to the charming city I got to know before.

My two friends and I arrive after our flight at 11AM, so we decide to drop off our bags in the lobby and go around town before check-in at 3PM. We get to the lobby, and my friend, who has major asthma, asked if we could get a peek at one of the rooms. The woman at the front desk was kind enough to give us a key to take a look. We opened the door, and the smell of mold hit us in the face like a brick. My friend was nervous, because she didn't think she'd be able to handle the smell, but we decided to wait to see if the room they gave us was the same, or if this was just a fluke.3PM comes, and we check in, and the room that they gave us is the same exact way. My friend already starts to feel a slight reaction, so we go to the lobby to see about a switch. According to the same rude and horrible Indian guy that everyone else describes working there, there are no other rooms available. I say that she cannot stay in that room because of her condition, and he says that his supervisor will be in in a half hour, if we want to talk to him. I said that we'll wait to ask about a refund, and suddenly, he had another room for us to check out. THAT room, however, was even worse! The door didn't lock fully, a light didn't work, the mold smell was even worse, and there was what seemed to be cat hair all over the single chair and the countertops. Now, the fun starts:We go back downstairs, and we say that we absolutely cannot stay there, and we want a refund. Apparently, we booked the non-refundable rate, the money was already taken out and there was nothing we could do about it. I said that we'd wait for his supervisor, and suddenly, he wasn't coming in anymore that night. He wasn't answering his phone, and we had to call back the next day between 9AM and 1PM. (Obviously, with the line of people out the door still waiting to check in with the horrible service, they didn't want any problems in the lobby) We said fine, and spent the rest of our first day in San Francisco looking for another hotel.Tthe next day, the woman who answered the lobby phone said that the supervisor DID come in about an hour after we left, and got off at 8:30 in the morning, RIGHT BEFORE we were supposed to call. I asked when he was going to be in again...she said 3:00. I asked for the manager's number. She gave me a different phone number and a different name, and asked me to explain the situation to her. I did, and she suddenly said that the supervisor wasn't coming in anymore today because he was tired, and I don't have to call the manager, but to deal with the supervisor, who will be in TOMORROW between 10 and 2. I called back at 3, and again, the Indian guy answered, and said the supervisor was around, but it was hard for him to get to a phone, and he'll do his best, but he doesn't know if he'll be able to talk. To make a long story longer, the supervisor never called back. We called the manager several times, and we are STILL being given the run around to get a refund for our non-stay. This hotel is the worst experience I have EVER had in ANY hotel. It should be closed down immediately, people should not be subjected to it, and the people at the front desk and in charge should never be allowed to work in a hotel again. I spent a total of about 20 minutes in this place, and the stress and trouble they are causing us now to get a refund for a time we didn't spend there is awful (especially since it's not like we didn't show up....we did, and they expect to just take our money for nothing, because WE have some sort of decency and hope to sleep comfortably without bed bugs, mold, and sickness).Please avoid this hotel at all costs....I would give it negative stars if possible......

Market is a busy street so the rooms on this side will be noisy. The McAllister side entry of the hotel has a handful of homeless/shady people constantly loitering close by and the street itself always smells like urine.When I checked in, the hotel staff were friendly and helpful. They tried hard to accommodate their guests. I have only nice things to say about the people who work here. The hotel itself, on the other hand, is far from reproach. While the lobby area looks decent, the rooms and hallways are old and sorta dirty. They really need to change the carpet.Let's start with the problems for the rooms, in order of worst to least annoyance:1) LOUD and CONSTANT knocking sound from the radiator. It sounds like you're sleeping in a construction zone with someone banging against metal pipes with a hammer. I called the front desk to report the problem twice and was told that there's nothing they could do about the radiator noise on the 2nd floor. However, they were able to move me to the 7th floor where the noise level was extant, but much more bearable. The hotel does not turn on the heat until 8 PM and turns it off at 7AM. Their 100 years old heating system needs to be upgraded to 21st century machines.2) Non-working wireless internet. Although I read online that this hotel does not have wireless, they did. I was able to connect to the hotel wireless but could not get internet. Several calls to the front desk produced no result so they gave me an 866 (supposed to be toll-free and free of charge, see complaint #3) number to reach the internet provider directly. I sat on the phone with the support desk staff for 20 minutes while he walked me through every step to troubleshoot the problem. It was then determined that the problem lies in the routers of the hotel, not the user, and that internet will not be available for an indefinite amount of time. Basically, the hotel had no free internet access for guests.3) Phone charge. When I received the 1-866-xxx-xxxx number to contact the front desk, I specifically asked whether they will charge me to make this call. Their answer was no. When I checked out of the hotel, they charged me $1 for connection fee because I made a call using their phone. I argued for a little but decided to just give them a buck instead of wasting my time. This was a completely unfair charge considering that I was double-deceived and still unable to resolve the internet problem. I should not be charge to contact their own vendor to rectify an issue for which Renoir Hotel should be responsible.4) Baby towels. The hotel's bath towels are rough and is about the size of a small wash cloth or half the width of a regular towel.5) Hard, lumpy bed. Yes, the bed seemed clean but it was hard and lumpy.6) 13&quot; color TV with cable but a dead remote7) There is no air conditioning, just a fan. I don't think A/C is really necessary in SF because you could just open the window to get some cool air. But would I want the urine smell on McAllister street to get into my room?Overall, I think the issue lies in the hotel owner and their management issues, not of their staff. I will not stay at this hotel again and I do not recommend others to book your stay here unless you are limited in choice (Priceline, cost, or whatever).

During the day I enjoyed walking around to see the sites, shop and experience some of the local eateries and pubs. I loved the Adagio's Tapas restaurant and bar in the evenings. Sat at the bar.

Finally I went to another bellman and said that guy said I cant park her but I need to check in.. He said &quot;sorry&quot; and when and got my luggage. I don't know if the was a language problem or what? But it not the usual greeting I get at hotels. I complained as I checked in and got a cool response apology. It was Valentine Day weekend and stayed in the Lotus Suite. I had flowers delivered and I noticed the bell man had them in his hand in a box.. I quietly said to him why do you have the flowers in your hand in a box, it supposed to be in the room as a surprise. He seemed not to understand as he puts the flower down on the dresser, I ask can I get a vase? It was a weird start to a trip at a 5 star hotel. The trip got better because the Lotus Room was simply beautiful and the view was spectacular out each window. I say through out my 3 day stay, I didn't find the front desk to be that friendly like other 5 star hotels, but the room made up for the lack of good customer service. A week after I the trip I received a request for a customer survey like many hotels send. I gave the hotel great marks besides customer service. When I marked down customer service then the survey ask me why low on customer service and I told them what happen when I arrived. Within a week I received a scolding letter from the hotel customer service supervisor mad because I marked them down in customer service. I couldn't believe it? They were saying will we investigated and they were making excuses for the bellman and said the bellman said he was sorry. Which didn't happen the other bellman said sorry for his co worker. But it wasn't just that incident that made me give low grades on customer service, it was the overall way they treated us. They didn't greet you as you pass the lobby, didn't rush to open the door as you came and they weren't that friendly or welcoming. I wasn't going to write a review on this hotel but when I got a scolding letter from the hotel because I marked them down was very insulting. When I wrote back and told them well I thought the customer service could be better and that I never got a apology from the bell man, they NEVER wrote back or responded to my letter it was like they just want to tell me off about my survey answers.

The room was spacious for a city hotel, and nicely done, with a large, attractive bath. (This is clearly a hotel where booking a better room category makes a big difference in your experience.) Views from the Tower elevators were equally impressive, although in a different direction, and made each elevator ride a real treat. The lobby of the tower building was very elegant and attractive, while the lobby of the main hotel maintained a nice mix of the historic architecture and modern decor.  We took advantage of the mid-week special dinner menu for St. Francis guests at Michael Mina, which was wonderful, and a fraction of the cost of the more extensive normal menu. The breakfast buffet at the Oak Room was very good, with lots of fresh fruit and excellent pastries (great chocolate croissants and banana nut muffins) as well as the usual hot items. (Although not listed on the menu, the cold buffet is available for less than the full buffet.) Some mornings we just picked up good pastries and coffee from the small bar in the lobby of the tower building, with plenty of spacious seating.

I booked this hotel on Priceline for a quarter what it was selling for on the open market. From what I can tell Priceliners usually get a very cramped room with no view in the &quot;old&quot; section. That was still fine with me, as the spectacular location, gorgeous public spaces, fantastic staff, and Heavenly Bed and Bath were good enough for me. And regardless, for about $60 a night they would have upgrading into the newer section (still a good value). We checked in late and, I'm assuming as a result, were given an upgraded room in the &quot;new&quot; tower on a high floor. It was magnificent. Spacious, clean, modern and with great views of San Francisco... it transformed out trip. As I mentioned, all Westin rooms (including this one) had wonderful beds and bathrooms. The front desk staff was friendly and more importantly polished - something I find less and less of these days. The room service, cleaning staff, and doormen were all excellent as well. I find the reviews complaining about extra charges at a four star hotel a little lame. It is, in fact, really annoying to pay high fees for internet, the business center, parking, fitness, breakfast etc. However that high end hotels charge for these services is no secret - avoiding them is a big part of why so many business travelers stay at places like Courtyard or Hilton Garden Inn. While those hotels might be a better value, they simply cannot touch the heritage and, frankly, class of the Westin St. Francis and its staff. They actually succeeded in turning a hotel stay into a memorable experience for my partner and me - something very hard to come by for otherwise budget travelers.

I had a few friends meet me up there and I was excited to stay at a hotel that I thought would live up to all the standards of a 4-star hotel.Room Quality - horribleWhen we arrived in on our floor, we were disappointed to find the hallways had a musty odor. We figured it was an older property, so we looked the other way until we arrived in our room only to find the same. The room smelled very musty and the carpets looked horrible. Our view of what they call a &quot;courtyard&quot; is a view of the roof with some astroturf looking material. The bathrooms were not the cleanest and very small. And if someone can tell me why they would even leave the 1970's TV in the already small bathroom, is beyond me. The room is very outdated, with what seemed to be Hawaiian headboard, flowery-printed drapery, and asian lamps and pictures on the wall. I've seen nicer rooms at college dorms. The beds were very uncomfortable and it seems that the mattresses were extremely old (perhaps purchased at the same time as the TV in the bathroom!). I shared a bed with my sister and the bed was so saggy that we ended up rolling into the middle of the bed - making for an unpleasant evening with a lovely backache to start off the day. They did have the feather-down comforter and pillow, but that can only do so much.Poor customer service - horribleWhen I arrived at check-in, no one even greeted us to check in. I had to ask the person at the front desk for some assistance. I received a $500 Marriott Travel Card for recognition from my employer. No one on the front desk staff new how to process this card. They then tried to call the number on the back of the card to verify that I really had a $500 balance on the card. There was woman who worked at the front desk who assisted me after the initial person didn't know what to do with the travel card. I can't remember her name but she had big glasses and short spiked grey hair. She seemed impatient not only with me, but with the front desk associate who originally assisted me. I mentioned to them both that I had received and used these travel cards in the past and how they were processed. They continued to tell me that's not what they do, and then told me I would need to surrender the travel card. My two nights stay would not total $500, so I questioned why I would need to give up my card that would still have a balance remaining after my stay. Again, the front desk staff didn't know how to handle this and instead tried to credit my room with $500. After my apparent frustration, they called the manager out and he wasn't quite sure how to handle it, but said if there was a credit balance, he would just credit one of my credit cards or send me a check in the mail. I knew this was probably not supposed to work that way, but had already stood at the front desk for 15 minutes and did not want to debate with them any longer. About 15 minutes after arriving in my room, I received a phone that I needed to come down to the front desk and pick up my travel card. I went back down, picked up my card. The next morning, the message light came on, and it was the front desk telling me they needed to see me because they didn't properly obtain a credit card at check in. This was all extremely frustrating as I tried to handle all of this when I originally checked in. I had 2 guests with me, and I can honestly say that we will never stay at this property and perhaps a Renaissance property again. I also called for a wake up call, and thought I would take advantage of the complimentary hot coffee and hot chocolate service that came with the wake up call. We received the complimentary beverages 30 minutes before the 9 a.m. wake-up call (only because my friend heard them through the paper-thin walls). When the beverages arrived, coffee and tea had been delivered. We had requested hot chocolate, so I called down to the front desk to inquire about this. They said they had me down for tea. I informed them I specifically asked for hot chocolate as I do not drink tea. Their exact words were in a very abrupt and rude voice, &quot;Well it says here you requested tea.&quot; I very politely informed her that I had requested hot chocolate and wanted to see if we could have some sent up. Her response to me was, &quot;You can't have this unless you request it the night before.&quot; I then told her that I had requested this the night before, that is how I received this service in the first place. She then sighed and said she would send some hot chocolate up. The concierge staff was rude and didn't even want to try and help us. I must say however, the driver with their complimentary car service was the only highlight of our stay.I definitely would stay far, far away from this property. Thank goodness I didn't really have to spend much time in my room during the day. It really is a depressing room. Its too bad, as I stay in Marriott properties at least 15 times a year.

Would have preferred to receive USA Today rather than the local paper, and never saw the USA Today available in the lobby as was mentioned in the room, but oh well, that's no biggie.Fitness center had nice machines but there are only three (!) - one bike, one treadmill and one elliptical plus a small area with a mat and an excercise ball. I know it's not a big hotel but IMO there should be more machines available, a minimum of two treadmills and at least some free weights. Also thought it was gross that there was no sanitizer to wipe the machines with - yuck. Luckily, there is a lot of cardio available from the city itself :)Did not have room service since there are so many options nearby - Starbucks kitty corner from the hotel, Working Girl's Cafe going the other way (awesome place) and Cafe Amici down the block (wouldn't really recommend that one). Favorite restaurant of the trip? Capurro's down at the wharf - great seafood, pizza and steaks, awesome happy hour and fabulous service. We liked it so much we went there three times in four days! Had lunch at Nonna Rose down by the wharf and liked it alot, and went to the trusty Boudin for tasty and inexpensive food too. Also went to the Irish Bank Bar and Restaurant which I would never recommend to anyone - horrible food, service and the place was dirty. Two out of three of us got a stomach ache after dinner here. All in all, I would choose to stay at the Orchard Garden again. It's not my favorite hotel but it certainly fills the bill for a business trip.

There was not a problem with noise this time around and I did not hear anyone in the surrounding rooms. Room service was efficient and very good, and the quality of everything from the bed linens to the bathroom fixtures was very luxurious.Parking is expensive at $57 a day and I paid it because I needed access to my car for business appointments outside the city.

While the internet was nice and convenient and I was happy to get tons of airline miles, the hotel itself left a lot to be desired. The floors creak like you wouldn't believe, and when your &quot;neighbor&quot; takes a shower at 6 AM it sounds like a loud freight train, making it impossibile to sleep. Speaking of 6 AM, I must mention the morning they gave me an unrequested wake-up call at 6 on a Saturday. A SATURDAY. The one morning I was able to sleep in and they screwed it up. The room and the entire hotel had this really strange odor which never really went away the whole time I was here, and the TV had far fewer channels than practically every hotel I've stayed at before.The excercise room was okay. Nothing special but it had everything I needed (treadmill and stairmaster) so I can't complain too much about that. As I mentioned, the in-room wireless internet was nice but it sure did break down a bunch, at least twice a day. It was always back up and running an hour or so later, but still an inconvenience. I should also mention that the room was pretty quiet (besides the creaky floors and loud pipes), since they gave me a room that faced the &quot;courtyard&quot; instead of Geary Street, but I've heard it can get really loud if you get a room facing the street so definitely keep that in mind if you decide to stay here.The only reason I give the hotel 2 dots out of 5 instead of 1 is due to the free internet as well as the decent location.

The valet service and the check-in were friendly and efficient, with our package details clearly spelled out. However, there was a snafu with the bags and I ended up having to go back downstairs to get them myself. The room was nicely appointed and clean. The room size was fairly small, not surprising for an older hotel but adequate for 2 people. Elevators were a bit slow, but acceptable considering the property is 80 years old.The Top of the Mark was great for late evening drinks (no kids allowed, drinks average $10 and proper dress is expected) with wonderful nighttime views of the city. Breakfast was outstanding, a high quality buffet with panaromic views stretching from downtown to Alcatraz and the Golden Gate Bridge. There is a cable car stop outside which can get you around, otherwise you are looking at a VERY steep walk to get down to Union Square and a real killer to walk back up Powell to California Street. Checkout was a bit slow, but all charges were clearly explained, unlike some earlier posters who seemed to have problems. Maybe it helps to be an InterContinental member. The car was waiting outside with no delay.Overall, if you like a place with history and class, this is a great place to stay.

It was my second visit to SFO but the first for everyone else. With 2 small children we wanted to stay somewhere central with easy access to transport. We were not disappointed from that respect with the Handlery. Shops galore and the cable car practically at the door step.We were in a club room so after checking in, the easiest access from and to our room was from the O'Farrell St entrance. There were renovations being undertaken at the time we stayed but we were unaffected aside from the fact we had to walk through the basement to get from the lobby to our room on the other side of the hotel.Check in was easy and staff very friendly. Our room was comfortable. Even though there were 4 of us and we had a lot of luggage given we were travelling with 2 small children, we did not feel too cramped and it was useful having a small dressing table just outside the bathroom. Our room looked over O'Farrell St and we did get a bit of street noise, including music and singing from the buskers until about 11pm to 12am but it did not really bother us and our children were able to sleep through it. Our room was just outside the lift though and they were noisy. But again we were not too bothered by it but be aware of it if you a light sleeper and noise sensitive. The beds were comfortable. The bathroom small but adequate.Our coffee maker was not working but was replaced very promptly with a new one. Our room missed being serviced on one day we stayed but clean towels were delivered to us quickly once we called for them. We also got a letter of apology from John Handlery regarding this in response to a feedback form we completed. With our 1 year old we needed to get boiled water and to be able to heat up food from time to time and the staff were very accommodating about that. We were able to access the staffroom to use the microwave.We did not find the concierge very friendly or approachable but the bell hops were very helpful and accommodating.We intended to, but did not get around to trying out the Daily Grill but there are lots of cafes and restaurants close by to try and many at reasonable prices. For breakfast Loris Diner is a good choice (we went back a few times) as is Cafe Mason. Both are just around the corner from the hotel. We had breakfast at Lefty O'Doulls one day but would not back. Food was below average compared to what else was nearby and service was not great. We tried to get into Dotties True Blue Cafe on Jones St given great reviews it got on TripAdvisor but there was a long line outside so we did not wait as we had to 2 children who were very hungry at that stage.We did a lot of walking and our 5 year old managed to keep up pretty well. If you are travelling with kids, Zeum and the Exploratorium are a must. Zeum is in walking distance (about 15 mins) and the Exploratorium accessible by bus. We went to the Aquarium which was good but not really that big and to be honest, if you have been to Kelly Tarlton's in Auckland, the Sydney Aquarium or the Aquarium in Vancouver, you won't really miss anything by giving the Pier 39 Aquarium a miss. You may want to go in any event though if you have kids as they do have some touching pools where you can touch starfish and some fish.We bought the 7 day City Pass which was very handy, and definitely worthwhile if you intend to hop on and off the cable car as otherwise the one ride or daily passes are relatively expensive.The cable car turning area at Powell and Market Streets always seemed to be busy with long lines. It seemed less of a wait at the cable car turning area at the end of the Powell Hyde line.Catch the cable car to the top of Lombard St - it stops literally right at the top where pretty gardens are - rather than approach from the bottom as walking down is definitely easier than walking up! It's easy to catch the cable car back to the city from the bottom of the street.Book your Alcatraz tickets at least a couple of days in advance even in the low season. It was not peak season when we went but we still had to wait for a couple of days before there were available spaces.We did a Wok Wizz walking tour of Chinatown - our guide was very informative and gave us lots of good tips of places to go for people wanting to purchase or see particular things. The tour included a stop at the fortune cookie factory on Ross Street (I think) where we could see how the cookies were made, sample them and of course buy. It was USD5 for a big bag. Very yummy. If you are heading to Chinatown and looking for the more authentic stores, ie the ones where the locals buy their fresh fruit and vegetables and groceries etc, head to Stockton St and Jackson St. Grant St, the street with the Chinatown gate is more for tourists. Cheap T-shirts galore - about USD2 or 3 each. Ghiradelli Square and Hyde St Pier is a good place to spend a relaxing morning or afternoon, especially if you are interested in historic ships and maritime matters. It is also where the Ghiradelli chocolate factory and shops are. Although we had 7 days in SFO, we took things reasonably slowly since we were travelling with kids, but we could probably have easily spent another few days, or even a week, to see some of the other things we didn't get to!One other thing to be aware of is that it is pretty cool in SFO, apparently at any time of the year. Even though it was mid Spring when we went, we found it at times cooler than it was back in Auckland (where it was mid Autumn). Layers are definitely recommended and I would make sure you have a fleece or similar, especially for the kids if you are going to be down near hthe pier/wharf areas. Having said that, if you forget to pack them, there are plenty of places to buy them at relatively cheap prices.For non-Americans and people who have not been to the States before, it might be useful to know that pharmacies like Walgreens, which can be found all over central city, sell almost anything that you would want from a supermarket at reasonable prices so a good place to go to stock up on bottled water, snacks and the like.

When we made our reservation we were torn between booking two separate non-suite rooms or the adjoining two bedroom suite. We ended up going with the two separate rooms because of the giant cost difference. When we arrived at Hotel Drisco to check in, we were told that my parent's room had been upgraded to a suite, however both rooms were located in the basement, down the hall from the service entrance, across from an ice machine and the breakfast room. Our windows overlooked the kitchen of the hotel and the rooms were very dark. Needless to say we were disappointed and considered switching hotels, however the desk staff was able to move us both into an adjoining two bedroom suite on the corner of the top floor. The new rooms had beautiful light, gorgeous views of the Bay and Alcatraz and it was like we were staying in a completely different hotel. We loved, loved loved our new rooms.The adjoined two bedroom suites are great if you're traveling as a group, however one of the bedrooms in these two bedroom suites has no bathroom attached. You have to cross the private hall (to which both bedrooms in the suite have access) to get to the bathroom. If the person staying in the other bedroom is not traveling with you, you could conceivably be walking out of your shower into your room and pass a stranger in the hall. It was a bit bizarre. I would recommend this hotel ONLY if you are given a room on the top two floors. It would be quite loud otherwise, and much less private. The only problem is, you are given no guarantees as to where your room is until you check in. It's a bit of a gamble. Also, beware. The prices of rooms fluctuate. When we were moved to the double room suite, the price we were quoted at the desk was nearly $100 less per night than what we were quoted when we originally made the decision to stick with the smaller, single rooms. That said, bathrooms in both suites and non-suites were beautiful and large, the breakfast were very nice, and Thanh (sp?) the bellhop/doorman was so kind and friendly.

I have found that you are the best source to find a hotel. My family and I were traveling to Yosemite and decided to stay three days in San Francisco. It was a hard decision to make but after reading your reviews decided on the Pan Pacific in San Francisco. What a wonderful decision. The hotel' s location is great -- it is within walking distance of many many stores/shopping. It is a short distance (5 minute walk) to the cable cars, Chinatown (walking distance a little longer), if you are renting from Hertz I believe they will do that for you (at least I know they will return the car for a $5 fee), and many other restaurants for breakfast, lunch and dinner. They are also close to several drug stores and mini markets. The hotel is beautiful inside and the rooms were roomy for 2 adults and 2 children with 5 pieces of luggage. The service and concierge were exceptional and went out of their way to do extra things for us. I cannot say enough about this place and the people who are working there. After going to Yosemite and several others places we needed to return to San Francisco for our return flight home and wanted to stayed again at the Pan Pacific which we did. The concierge printed our boarding passes for our airline and even arranged for a cab to be downstairs at a certain time to take us to the airport. This hotel even offers free car service during certain times of the day and several times instead of a cab they offered us the car for our own use. We loved this hotel and its location and would definitely stay here again.

It wouldn't have been my first choice. I normally stay at a four or five star hotel. Also, this was quite a commute to Moscone.Based on other reviews, I called to request a room in the main building. On arrival, I was given a room on the business executive floor (5th). There were 3 computers available for guests on the floor. My room had free wireless internet, a small refrigerator and microwave. The room had been renovated fairly recently and was in nice shape. The bed was comfortable and with the choices from the pillow menu, I slept surprisingly well.The only downside to the stay was the small in-room safe. I had called in advance to make sure there was a safe in the room that would hold my laptop. I was put on hold for about 5 minutes while they checked. On arrival, I found that the safe was too small to hold my purse, much less my laptop. For the price paid, this was a nice hotel. It is very convenient to the touristy wharf area.

Check in was quick, actually, we checked in at 7pm on a saturday night. Anna at front desk, was nice. Americano was happening with corporate types and hipsters.The room. Wow. I mentioned on online reservations it would be an anniversary weekend for my boyfriend and I. They placed rose petals in the shape of a heart on the bedand a complimentary bottle of champagne in an ice bucket with two champagne flutes on the table, a 'happy anniversary' card, and a cd playing electronica (the more relaxing kind) on the beautifully lit bedisde table. Didn't cost me extra. It was all complimentary. We loved it. What an awesome staff.We had dinner reservations at Foreign Cinema, so we asked if they could call us a taxi. Actually, there is a shuttle car on site. It cost us $20 excluding tip. Better to take a cab if you want to save some cash, or are not going on a date. But in our case, we were on a date so we went with the Lincoln shuttle car instead.When we came back from dinner, we were actually still quite hungry. (Though tasty, yes, Foreign Cinema serves small portions).So we went downstairs to Americano. Unfortuantely they stop serving food at 11pm. The barback, Louie is a really cool person. We took our drinks outside on a small table near the heating lamp and enjoyed the ambiance on Embarcadero and the water.After that, we returned to our room at about 1 am, still a little hungry. Apparently, guests were ordering Pizza as there was a pizza delivery man going back and fourth from floor to floor delivering food.We're glad we ordered from Cable Car Pizza. Pretty darn good food for delivering at 1am. Good tiramisu too.We drank champagne, even in our beautiful rainfall shower, lol.I don't find this negative, but you can hear people in the halls.

We watched most of it while getting ready for the day. People were crowded around, taking pictures of the bikers and getting autographs. A cool thing to see.It was check out time, unfortunately. Anna, at front desk, offered to hold my bags til I got back from shopping around the city, even though I was already checked out.
