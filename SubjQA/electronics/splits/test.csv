I created the account and was presented with a new way to manage my router.  The new way has a new (and improved) management screen that makes it easy to manage, it takes some time to get used to, but it is very user friendly (I am used to the more technical way, so I have to look closer through the options to find most stuff).  The system is nice since you can access it from different computers without using your home network.  You can now use neat apps to limit the network (like content and media and protect your network), most apps are advertised and some are available for Android, but most say coming soon for iPhone.  Some look promising and the new system is neat.  I look forward to the improved version for iPhone (over Cisco Connect Home). -- One thing to point out, the Cisco Cloud will log you out if you do not stay active (kind of bad for your own router...), but the device list customization is nice and you can add custom names and images for each item (to easily recognize suspicious devices.The iPhone app is also available in the Apple App Store and is a small install.  Once I logged in (with the account I created when I launched the router page), from the app you can see the status of your network (is it connected to internet, who [what devices] are connected), you can also edit most parts of the router settings (not the more advanced stuff, like the QoS, Gaming, and Internet settings), but you can edit passwords, wireless names and passwords, and guest access.  Pretty neat, and it will be fun to see what other apps become available that make this even better.I also wanted to add that when I tried to add my USB Storage device, I ran into trouble.  I had the drive formatted in exFAT (I did not want the 4GB file size limitation of FAT 32 nor a specific to Windows or Mac (since I use both)).  I plugged in the drive and the Cloud Connect did not recognize it.  I contacted support and they informed me that the router only supports: FAT32, NTFS and HFS+ formats.  So, I wanted to let you all know, just in case you try to use it with a LINUX formatted or exFAT formatted drive.  I am going to format it into NTFS and use the network only to connect to it from my Mac.  Once it was formatted for NTFS, the Cisco Connect Cloud recognized it instantly.  The settings were easy to understand and there were easy options to setup FTP settings for accessing files over the internet (I did not want this, since I just wanted to share the drive on the local network).  When I opened Finder on my Mac I could get to my drive over the router name in Shared section.  The USB storage section also included addresses to access your storage drive.I was excited to see this router after seeing the online push and emails that Cisco has sent out advertising there new Router with Apps.  I was curious on what they would utilize with the Apps.  Since my E4200v2 and E2000 both support the Cisco Connect Express app from my iPhone.  Apparently the big app, that is what all the buzz is about is the Cisco Connect Cloud.  I looked around for it, and it is not advertised on the box or on many sites, so I finally found it on the Cisco website, but it apparently will not be available until the Summer (I always believe that stuff should not be released until all the features are available, with apps and cloud based services this type of delay has become quite prominent). So I cannot use the main new feature until later...  Cisco says once it is available the Cisco Connect app/software will alert me.  As soon as it is available I will definitely try it out, but I have a fear with that high amount of Upstream traffic will slow my network down (I have AT&T; DSL), so I am curious about it, and will update my review when it is available.Now for the router itself:Like I said, I am updating from a Linksys E4200v2 to the Linksys EA4500.  So far there is no difference.  They have the exact specs (from what I see), just the new one has app enabled (for an app that is not out yet...)So Since they are near identical routers, installation was similar.  I never like using the install CDs, since I do not want there software on my computers.  So I plugged into the router using a network cable, and went to the router's home page (192.168.1.1).  The default setting is username: admin, password: admin.  I then from the main page set up my DSL connection, so since I have AT&T; DSL, I selected PPPoE, then inserted my att email and then my password (provided by your DSL provider), it is a different approach for Cable Internet (MAC Cloning is the easiest), although if you are not sure how to do this you might want to go with the software, I am familiar with setting up networks, so it is easier to do it manually.  Set your routers IP here, and the range of addresses for leasing (you can just use the default, unless you need more than 50 devices, then change it accordingly).I then went to the Wireless tab and set up Manual WiFi settings, I like broadcasting on the 2.4 and 5GHz so I can manually connect my 5GHz devices to this network and my 2.4GHz to there network (although 2.4GHz devices cannot see the 5GHz broadcast).  I gave each network a recognizable name for my network, and then used WPA-2 Personal for encryption, make sure to use at least two combinations (numbers + letters or + symbols), it makes brute force attacks nearly impossible due to time required (I use letters + numbers + symbols).\I then set up the Guest Access (which can be done from the web interface, this was not possible on the E2000s), I gave it a name and a password and limited it to 5 guests.  Guest access creates a network separate from your main network, different IP address group for the two (for example my home is 192.168.1.XXX, and my guest is 192.168.3.XXX), this way guest cannot see my machines on my main network.  A neat feature when relatives come over.I then went over to Quality of Service and set my Media Center, Roku 2, and Skype Applications as High Priority to ensure that they work properly even if I have a lot of activity on other devices.I also went into the DHCP Reservation (Home page toward bottom), and gave my Printer a Static IP address.  To do this go to DHCP and then if you see your printer in the list check the box next to it and hit Add, then give it a name and Static address.  You then need to tell the printer to use that Static IP (this ensures proper behavior).  If you do not see your item yet in the Client list, you can get your MAC address from the device (make sure to get Wireless if you plan to connect wirelessly or Wired if you plan to connect over Wire (they are different MAC addresses, even in the same machine! [Separate network devices]).  Then in the DHCP Client type in a name, your preferred IP address and then the MAC address.  I do this for printers to ensure that computers that connect to it using its IP address stay connected even if the network reboots and issues out new IP addresses (it takes a little extra time, but is worth it to ensure devices like Printers stay active on the network).This device can have USB HDD and USB Printer plugged in to serve as a file or print server.  This is great for people who have older USB printers and want to share it across the network without keeping a PC running all the time just to host it.  The file sharing is also nice for large USB HDD that you want access to over the network.In the end this is a great router, has some great features and is easy to install and monitor (whether you use the Cisco Connect or the Web Interface), I look forward to playing with the Cisco Connect Cloud (and wish that when devices come out that their new features were available at release), but in the end if you need a router able to handle larger networks, and high entense applications (I canceled Satellite for Internet Streaming and Off Air broadcasting (HD HomeRun to Media Center Computer with Hulu Desktop) and Roku 2, and canceled home phone for a Skype subscription.  Therefore, I need a router that can handle this type of network activity, and these routers (EA4500, E4200v2) have worked perfectly and never have any problem keeping my network live!

A superior Leica lens with a high-resolution sensor, advanced image processing, and plenty of sophisticated features in a small but very solid and stylish body.PROS:- Solid metal body, stylish design, nice dark-blue color- Very convenient one-hand grip, unusual for such a small pocket-size body- Short startup time (1-1.5 sec), no shutter lag, fast auto focus- A dedicated Movie-button for instant recording- Big 3"" colorful ""juicy"" display visible even in direct sunlight- Intuitive menu plus very convenient Quick-menu with a dedicated button- Excellent quality Leica lens: sharp and contrast in the entire zoom range- Wide 25mm (35mm equiv.) is very convenient for indoors- Huge 12x optical zoom (up to 300mm equiv.) in such a compact design- Two-speed of zooming - fast/slow controlled by the lever- Smooth and silent auto focus and optical image stabilization- Best in the industry ""iAuto"" mode - you can really trust it!- New ""Intelligent Resolution"" feature greatly improves the image quality- Creative Aperture- and Shutter-priority and full Manual modes- Three independent scenery modes including ""High Dynamic"" range scene- New GPS feature for those who travel a lot- Very good movie quality in 720p AVCHD mode looks like a full 1080 HD one- High-quality stereo microphones- Accepts SD/SDHC and new SDXC huge capacity memory cardsCONS:- A mechanical lever for switching between shooting and playback modes- Some soft ""sh-sh-sh"" noise while zooming in and out (but no ""clicks"")- I wish more sensitivity for low-light shootingBUILD: The ZS7 camera looks and feels as good as it's predecessor DMC-ZS3. The design is almost as the same, just the power switch and the mode dial exchanged their places. One significant addition - a GPS mark on the top, right above the lens. The blue color is not that dark as on TZ5 and not so striking bright as on ZR1. A slight dent on the back with some prominence on the right side makes a very convenient grip to operate with one hand. A metal body looks pretty solid, however it is not that heavy.PERFORMANCE: The new camera has a pretty good performance: the startup time is a little bit more than 1 sec and with almost zero shutter lag. Taking into account a new very quick ""Sonic Speed"" auto focus, which takes about 0.35-0.4 sec, you will be able to catch virtually every spur-of-the-moment photo. And a dedicated movie button allows starting video recording at any time without any preparation.LENS: Leica lens is just excellent: unusually big for a so small body 12x zoom starting with the very convenient for indoors shooting 25mm up to telephoto 300mm (equiv.) plus a quick and precise auto focus (however might be somewhat slower in low-light), and good optical image stabilization in conjunction with the digital one which allows you to take sharp pictures in the entire zoom range and at the very low shutter speed around 1/8 and even 1/4. The auto-focusing and optical image stabilization work in absolute silence, and the only zooming produces some soft ""sh-sh-sh"" noise. Good news - without any start/stop clicks on the footage :).DISPLAY: A large 3-inch high-resolution LCD monitor with 460K pixels has a very good contrast and saturation - the pictures look very ""juicy"". The brightness also is high enough to be seen even in a direct sun-light (just a bit darker) and in a wide angle of view. All that allows to share photos and videos immediately with other people.MENU: For those who used the Panasonic P&S; cameras before the ZS7 menu looks very familiar, just some new items added. Also there is a Quick-Menu button which is very helpful for a quick access to the most frequently used settings. The new camera has such a luxury as the Aperture, Shutter speed, and Manual modes and there is a new Exposure button (next to the video one) which allows to set manually the aperture using the Left-Right buttons and the shutter speed with Up-Down buttons.AUTO SETTINGS: The best in the industry Panasonic's Intelligent Auto mode is getting better with each new model. Actually it's a whole bunch of sophisticated algorithms which help to take really nice pictures with minimum efforts. They are worth to be aware about so here is a brief list of most effective of them.""Intelligent Scene Selector"" - It quickly analyzes the light conditions as well as focusing results and selects either portrait, scenery, macro, night portrait or night scenery. It also displays a small icon of the chosen scene in the top left corner. The feature is extremely helpful when you need to shoot very fast on spur-of-the-moment.""Intelligent ISO"" - If camera detects that your subject is moving, it raises ISO and shutter speed to take shots without motion blur, otherwise it will try to keep the lowest possible ISO to reduce noise and to get nice clear pictures.""Intelligent Exposure"" - it's a kind of a small brother of the High Dynamic Range feature. If the camera sets the correct overall exposure but some areas happen to be too dark, this feature automatically increases the brightness of the dark areas to make the entire picture to look more balanced. It also pretty effective for the backlight conditions - instead of getting just a silhouette of your subject against the bright sky it makes the subject normally exposed but without washing out the nice blue sky.""Face Detection"" - is another great thing for taking good-quality pictures of people. It happened to me a number of times in the past that a presence in the frame of a more contrast element somewhere behind the person I'm taking picture of was making the camera to adjust focus at that unimportant distant object and therefore made the major person out-of-focus. The same way if there is a bright background behind the person then the camera will measure the luminance of that background while the person's image will be pretty much underexposed (dark). The Face Detection feature identifies the human faces and tells the camera to adjust focus and exposure for the faces first so the people on the picture will be looking well exposed, clear and sharp.ADVANCED FEATURES: I guess the most interesting and advanced is a new ""Intelligent Resolution"" feature. Actually it combines a sophisticated noise reduction with a new picture enhancement algorithm. This feature automatically identifies the 3 type of the picture areas: outlines, detailed textures, and smooth gradation panes and provides an optimized handling for each of them separately. As a result the photo looks sharper at the edges and more clean in between. Many old P&S; cameras had pretty fast picture quality degradation at the ISO around 300-400 and higher. The shots taken by ZS7 even at ISO 400 look pretty good on the small and even medium-size prints.IMAGE QUALITY: Imagine on a sunny day you take an outdoors picture of a wall made of the new brown bricks with a $3000 DSLR and a small P&S; camera from the distance about 6-8 feet. How could you recognize by which camera was taken a certain shot? The subject is plain so no Depth-of-Field is involved into comparison. However in this example the two characteristics will help to distinct the cameras: 1) The edges of bricks will be well outlined on DSLR shots and a kind of fuzzy on the P&S; ones; 2) The new bricks do not have any structure on their sides, they are just plane and so exactly that way they will look on the DSLR shots, while on the P&S; ones their sides will show more or less amount of noise. If you perform the same test for an evenly cut line of bushes (again DOF is not involved) you will see the same result plus the internal structure of each leaf will be more clear on the DSLR photos. So to make pictures taken with your P&S; camera looking like the DSLR ones the P&S; camera should make the outlines sharper, clean the noise on the plane or soft gradation areas, and slightly emphasize the internal structures, if any. That is exactly what the new ""Intelligent Resolution"" (IR) feature tries to do.The ""iAuto"" mode in ZS7 is organized the way that you will have decent, good photos in virtually any situation right out-of-the-box. The several hundreds shots I took by now look good on my 24"" display and so they will on the similar size prints. But if you look at them at 100% crop (magnification) then on many of them you might find some areas which do not look natural. If the IR-algorithm decides about a certain low-contrast part on your picture that it's a plane area then it will remove all the noise altogether with all the subtle details from that part of the picture. If you take a picture of a big tree with hundreds of branches (but without leaves) against a bright sky the IR-feature will treat it as a structured area and will slightly sharpen it to look clearer. But when you take a landscape picture with many distant trees in front and behind, those hundreds of crossing branches will create a low-contrast pattern which together with internal sensor's noise might look for IR-algorithm as just a noisy plain area and so it will obliterate all the details leaving only some average color in that part of the picture and so making it looking very unnatural. The thing is that unlike the previous models the noise reduction in ZS7 is pretty strong. I would not call it ""aggressive"" but it's really strong.QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS: There is a way how to get the best out of this camera while shooting landscapes on sunny days. Here is a recipe for experienced amateurs:- Switch the mode dial to the program ""P"" mode.- Press the Menu button and select the lowest ISO 80 instead of ""Auto"" (this is the key-point! If there is no enough light to set that low ISO it will not work).- Make sure you have the ""Intelligent Resolution"" feature on!- Find on the 4th page of the shooting menu the item ""PICT.ADJ."" and press the right button to go inside. You will see the 4 pictures attributes:CONTRASTSHARPNESSSATURATIONNOISE REDUCTION- A default value for each of them is ""0"". Set ""-1"" for contrast (to reduce the clipping of highlights), ""+1"" for sharpness, leave the saturation unchanged, and most important set noise reduction to ""-1"" or even to its minimum ""-2"". Take this advice as a starting point and try to play with the SHARPNESS and NOISE REDUCTION settings and see what looks more appropriate for you, because some people prefer more sharpness while the others are more concern about noise visibility, so try different settings and choose which one looks better for you.Those settings will allow you to take the most sharp and detailed pictures of landscapes, architecture, etc. if you like that. However you should be alert and check periodically the quality of pictures and if something is going wrong then switch immediately to ""iAuto"" mode. The ZS7's intelligent auto-mode is very sophisticated and might take into account the parameters you're not even aware about. For example, if you apply the full zoom then the aperture drops to a small F/4.9 value giving much less light for the sensor and additionally at that huge focal length 300mm (equiv.) the impact of your shaking hands might be as so much that the optical image stabilization can not completely compensate it and so the camera will have to increase the shutter speed to have the picture un-blurred. In that tough scenario the only high ISO around 300-400 might satisfy all those conditions and the camera will normally set it in auto-mode. But if you keep shooting recklessly at ISO 80 without getting the feedback such kind of pictures might be spoiled in some way. So, use this recipe only if you know what you're doing.Update: Having using ZS7 for a while I've identified the 3 major types of pictures depending what is most important for you on those shots: 1) The main part are the areas with soft gradations like human faces, petals of flowers on macro shots, etc; 2) Mixed content of plain areas and patterns with no central subject; 3) Landscapes with plenty of trees, branches and leaves or small flowers. The above proposed recipe is most effective for the last category - it will give you the sharpest pictures with no low-contrast areas smeared by the strong noise reduction and on the other hand the higher level of noise will be effectively hidden by the complex image structure. For the 2nd category it would be wiser to decrease noise reduction just to -1 (not -2) to make the noise less visible on some plain areas, and for the 1st category it seems better to keep the default neutral setting since to have less noise on the human's face is much more important than lack of minor details around. Anyway you'll still have the advantage of less noise at minimum ISO.I did some comparative testing of ZS7 with my Nikon D90 to find out how much that new IR technology and the above mentioned recommendations could help to improve the overall picture quality. I've uploaded some pictures and put a link into my comments dated 04/24/2010 with the title ""Compare to Nikon D90"". Don't assume, just take a look - you might be a bit surprised :-)LOW LIGHT: Recently I performed a brief comparative test of my P&S; cameras: Panasonic ZS7 and Sony TX7. Shortly - their low-light performance (in normal mode) is very similar. The medium-size 8""x10"" prints without much cropping look good up to ISO 400. At ISO 800 there is a noticeable drop of the image quality of both cameras and at 1600 the shots look decent only for 4""x6"" prints. Generally the Sony TX7's shots look smoother because of more aggressive noise reduction while the Panasonic ZS7's ones display slightly more details along with a little bit more noise. So it's the matter of taste to decide which shots look better. I would admit that at ISO 1600 while the Panasonic's shots became much more blurred because of the increased noise reduction strength, the Sony's shots became poured with much coarse noise which got even stronger at ISO 3200 making the pictures completely unusable. So neither of these cameras could be considered as great low-light performers.In case when the shots become too dark because of big lack of light you can select the ""HIGH SENS."" (sensitivity) scene. The camera will automatically choose a high ISO in the range 1600 - 6400 and decrease resolution to 3MP (it was stated 3200-6400 but in some tests my camera set ISO 1600). It will not provide better quality but at least will allow to increase the picture's brightness.NOTE! This camera is great outdoors, but if many of your pictures are indoors or in low-light environment then you'd better look for some other cameras like Panasonic LX5/LX3 or GF1, Canon S95/S90 or G12/G11, Fujifilm F80EXR, etc. which were designed especially for those conditions. The original model name of this camera is ""TZ"" which stands for ""Travel Zoom"" i.e. it was designed for travel outdoors, not for indoors.DYNAMIC RANGE: means the difference between the most light and dark areas on the picture. If you're taking the shots of your friends on a sunny day with a bright blue sky above and some bushes with green leaves aside and those bushes happen to be in the shadow of a nearby building then the difference between brightness of the sky and the bushes will be thousands of times. On the shots taken by a camera with narrow dynamic range only one element - your friends might look good, but the sky will be completely washed out to white and the bushes will be almost black. For the cameras with a decent DR like ZS7 at least two elements of that picture will look good i.e. either your friends with a nice blue sky while the bushes will be very dark, or the friends and bushes good but the sky pretty much wiped out. The new Panasonic ZS7 has the two solutions to help in such situations: the ""Intelligent Exposure"" feature and the ""High Dynamic (range)"" scene.Although both solutions aim at the same goal they work in a different way and should be used in different situations. The ""Intelligent Exposure"" feature once it is activated via the main or quick menu puts its white icon to the lower left corner and starts constantly analyzing the picture. If the difference in brightness of some significant areas of the picture exceeds a certain threshold then the icon becomes yellow and that feature decreases the overall contrast of the picture. Since that threshold is very high that feature would be mostly useful on the bright sunny days. Its effectiveness is not that big but it still can be helpful and anyway it's better than nothing so you can have it turned on all the time. The ""High Dynamic"" scene should be used only in low light conditions because even in a bright sun it will unconditionally set ISO 400 (or even higher) and decrease the shutter speed. Such a high ISO will greatly increase the amount of noise and therefore will cause a more aggressive noise reduction which will actively obliterate small details. That scene provides much more effective dynamic range compression but at the cost of significantly decreased picture quality. If you're shooting in a low-light condition you have nothing to loose, but if you're taking pictures on a nice day with a plenty of sunshine the loss of quality might greatly disappoint you, so that scene should be used only for the low-light shooting.MOVIE MODE: By now I tried only the advanced AVCHD movie mode - it looked very well. Apart from the processing the still images in this model Panasonic applied their new ""Intelligent Resolution"" feature to video recording as well and the result is just gorgeous! Because of that special processing personally its 720p HD looks even better than from my Sony TX7 with its full 1080 HD resolution.So this new Panasonic ZS7 camera is a very good device for taking nice still pictures and advanced video recording.

A superior Leica lens with a high-resolution sensor, advanced image processing, and plenty of sophisticated features in a small but very solid and stylish body.PROS:- Solid metal body, stylish design, nice dark-blue color- Very convenient one-hand grip, unusual for such a small pocket-size body- Short startup time (1-1.5 sec), no shutter lag, fast auto focus- A dedicated Movie-button for instant recording- Big 3"" colorful ""juicy"" display visible even in direct sunlight- Intuitive menu plus very convenient Quick-menu with a dedicated button- Excellent quality Leica lens: sharp and contrast in the entire zoom range- Wide 25mm (35mm equiv.) is very convenient for indoors- Huge 12x optical zoom (up to 300mm equiv.) in such a compact design- Two-speed of zooming - fast/slow controlled by the lever- Smooth and silent auto focus and optical image stabilization- Best in the industry ""iAuto"" mode - you can really trust it!- New ""Intelligent Resolution"" feature greatly improves the image quality- Creative Aperture- and Shutter-priority and full Manual modes- Three independent scenery modes including ""High Dynamic"" range scene- New GPS feature for those who travel a lot- Very good movie quality in 720p AVCHD mode looks like a full 1080 HD one- High-quality stereo microphones- Accepts SD/SDHC and new SDXC huge capacity memory cardsCONS:- A mechanical lever for switching between shooting and playback modes- Some soft ""sh-sh-sh"" noise while zooming in and out (but no ""clicks"")- I wish more sensitivity for low-light shootingBUILD: The ZS7 camera looks and feels as good as it's predecessor DMC-ZS3. The design is almost as the same, just the power switch and the mode dial exchanged their places. One significant addition - a GPS mark on the top, right above the lens. The blue color is not that dark as on TZ5 and not so striking bright as on ZR1. A slight dent on the back with some prominence on the right side makes a very convenient grip to operate with one hand. A metal body looks pretty solid, however it is not that heavy.PERFORMANCE: The new camera has a pretty good performance: the startup time is a little bit more than 1 sec and with almost zero shutter lag. Taking into account a new very quick ""Sonic Speed"" auto focus, which takes about 0.35-0.4 sec, you will be able to catch virtually every spur-of-the-moment photo. And a dedicated movie button allows starting video recording at any time without any preparation.LENS: Leica lens is just excellent: unusually big for a so small body 12x zoom starting with the very convenient for indoors shooting 25mm up to telephoto 300mm (equiv.) plus a quick and precise auto focus (however might be somewhat slower in low-light), and good optical image stabilization in conjunction with the digital one which allows you to take sharp pictures in the entire zoom range and at the very low shutter speed around 1/8 and even 1/4. The auto-focusing and optical image stabilization work in absolute silence, and the only zooming produces some soft ""sh-sh-sh"" noise. Good news - without any start/stop clicks on the footage :).DISPLAY: A large 3-inch high-resolution LCD monitor with 460K pixels has a very good contrast and saturation - the pictures look very ""juicy"". The brightness also is high enough to be seen even in a direct sun-light (just a bit darker) and in a wide angle of view. All that allows to share photos and videos immediately with other people.MENU: For those who used the Panasonic P&S; cameras before the ZS7 menu looks very familiar, just some new items added. Also there is a Quick-Menu button which is very helpful for a quick access to the most frequently used settings. The new camera has such a luxury as the Aperture, Shutter speed, and Manual modes and there is a new Exposure button (next to the video one) which allows to set manually the aperture using the Left-Right buttons and the shutter speed with Up-Down buttons.AUTO SETTINGS: The best in the industry Panasonic's Intelligent Auto mode is getting better with each new model. Actually it's a whole bunch of sophisticated algorithms which help to take really nice pictures with minimum efforts. They are worth to be aware about so here is a brief list of most effective of them.""Intelligent Scene Selector"" - It quickly analyzes the light conditions as well as focusing results and selects either portrait, scenery, macro, night portrait or night scenery. It also displays a small icon of the chosen scene in the top left corner. The feature is extremely helpful when you need to shoot very fast on spur-of-the-moment.""Intelligent ISO"" - If camera detects that your subject is moving, it raises ISO and shutter speed to take shots without motion blur, otherwise it will try to keep the lowest possible ISO to reduce noise and to get nice clear pictures.""Intelligent Exposure"" - it's a kind of a small brother of the High Dynamic Range feature. If the camera sets the correct overall exposure but some areas happen to be too dark, this feature automatically increases the brightness of the dark areas to make the entire picture to look more balanced. It also pretty effective for the backlight conditions - instead of getting just a silhouette of your subject against the bright sky it makes the subject normally exposed but without washing out the nice blue sky.""Face Detection"" - is another great thing for taking good-quality pictures of people. It happened to me a number of times in the past that a presence in the frame of a more contrast element somewhere behind the person I'm taking picture of was making the camera to adjust focus at that unimportant distant object and therefore made the major person out-of-focus. The same way if there is a bright background behind the person then the camera will measure the luminance of that background while the person's image will be pretty much underexposed (dark). The Face Detection feature identifies the human faces and tells the camera to adjust focus and exposure for the faces first so the people on the picture will be looking well exposed, clear and sharp.ADVANCED FEATURES: I guess the most interesting and advanced is a new ""Intelligent Resolution"" feature. Actually it combines a sophisticated noise reduction with a new picture enhancement algorithm. This feature automatically identifies the 3 type of the picture areas: outlines, detailed textures, and smooth gradation panes and provides an optimized handling for each of them separately. As a result the photo looks sharper at the edges and more clean in between. Many old P&S; cameras had pretty fast picture quality degradation at the ISO around 300-400 and higher. The shots taken by ZS7 even at ISO 400 look pretty good on the small and even medium-size prints.IMAGE QUALITY: Imagine on a sunny day you take an outdoors picture of a wall made of the new brown bricks with a $3000 DSLR and a small P&S; camera from the distance about 6-8 feet. How could you recognize by which camera was taken a certain shot? The subject is plain so no Depth-of-Field is involved into comparison. However in this example the two characteristics will help to distinct the cameras: 1) The edges of bricks will be well outlined on DSLR shots and a kind of fuzzy on the P&S; ones; 2) The new bricks do not have any structure on their sides, they are just plane and so exactly that way they will look on the DSLR shots, while on the P&S; ones their sides will show more or less amount of noise. If you perform the same test for an evenly cut line of bushes (again DOF is not involved) you will see the same result plus the internal structure of each leaf will be more clear on the DSLR photos. So to make pictures taken with your P&S; camera looking like the DSLR ones the P&S; camera should make the outlines sharper, clean the noise on the plane or soft gradation areas, and slightly emphasize the internal structures, if any. That is exactly what the new ""Intelligent Resolution"" (IR) feature tries to do.The ""iAuto"" mode in ZS7 is organized the way that you will have decent, good photos in virtually any situation right out-of-the-box. The several hundreds shots I took by now look good on my 24"" display and so they will on the similar size prints. But if you look at them at 100% crop (magnification) then on many of them you might find some areas which do not look natural. If the IR-algorithm decides about a certain low-contrast part on your picture that it's a plane area then it will remove all the noise altogether with all the subtle details from that part of the picture. If you take a picture of a big tree with hundreds of branches (but without leaves) against a bright sky the IR-feature will treat it as a structured area and will slightly sharpen it to look clearer. But when you take a landscape picture with many distant trees in front and behind, those hundreds of crossing branches will create a low-contrast pattern which together with internal sensor's noise might look for IR-algorithm as just a noisy plain area and so it will obliterate all the details leaving only some average color in that part of the picture and so making it looking very unnatural. The thing is that unlike the previous models the noise reduction in ZS7 is pretty strong. I would not call it ""aggressive"" but it's really strong.QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS: There is a way how to get the best out of this camera while shooting landscapes on sunny days. Here is a recipe for experienced amateurs:- Switch the mode dial to the program ""P"" mode.- Press the Menu button and select the lowest ISO 80 instead of ""Auto"" (this is the key-point! If there is no enough light to set that low ISO it will not work).- Make sure you have the ""Intelligent Resolution"" feature on!- Find on the 4th page of the shooting menu the item ""PICT.ADJ."" and press the right button to go inside. You will see the 4 pictures attributes:CONTRASTSHARPNESSSATURATIONNOISE REDUCTION- A default value for each of them is ""0"". Set ""-1"" for contrast (to reduce the clipping of highlights), ""+1"" for sharpness, leave the saturation unchanged, and most important set noise reduction to ""-1"" or even to its minimum ""-2"". Take this advice as a starting point and try to play with the SHARPNESS and NOISE REDUCTION settings and see what looks more appropriate for you, because some people prefer more sharpness while the others are more concern about noise visibility, so try different settings and choose which one looks better for you.Those settings will allow you to take the most sharp and detailed pictures of landscapes, architecture, etc. if you like that.

I initially purchased a 6ft HDMI cable made by Monster Cable for around $80 for the the connection from the receiver to the TV and needed 3 additional HDMI cables for the rest of my media centers connections. After some extensive research and shopping around I decided on these and I could not be happier. The build quality of these is exceptional. They are thick and well shielded and the picture and sound quality is equal to that of the 8x more expensive Monster cables. Also, one important consideration is that these are certified to be compliant with the HDMI 1.3 specification, meaning that they have greater bandwidth and are capable of transmitting via bitstream Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio (2 newer Lossless or uncompressed audio formats) as well as supporting xvYCC and Deep Color (essentially these 2 newer standards make colors look more vibrant and real), all necessary for today's HDTV's and for lossless audio for surround sound systems and blu-ray players that support these newer standards.Here is a link explaining the new HDMI 1.3 standard:[...]I spent a lot of money on my home theater setup and wanted to ensure I was getting high quality cables that would provide the highest throughput for the best quality picture and sound possible.

I initially purchased a 6ft HDMI cable made by Monster Cable for around $80 for the the connection from the receiver to the TV and needed 3 additional HDMI cables for the rest of my media centers connections. After some extensive research and shopping around I decided on these and I could not be happier. The build quality of these is exceptional. They are thick and well shielded and the picture and sound quality is equal to that of the 8x more expensive Monster cables. Also, one important consideration is that these are certified to be compliant with the HDMI 1.3 specification, meaning that they have greater bandwidth and are capable of transmitting via bitstream Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio (2 newer Lossless or uncompressed audio formats) as well as supporting xvYCC and Deep Color (essentially these 2 newer standards make colors look more vibrant and real), all necessary for today's HDTV's and for lossless audio for surround sound systems and blu-ray players that support these newer standards.Here is a link explaining the new HDMI 1.3 standard:[...]I spent a lot of money on my home theater setup and wanted to ensure I was getting high quality cables that would provide the highest throughput for the best quality picture and sound possible. These definitely fit the bill and saved me over $200.

Here are the best features from my perspective:1.  The range of telephoto zoom is adequate for 90% of photo opportunites.  28-135 mm telephoto in digital photography translates into 48-230 mm in SLR film photography.  Since a standard camera lens is 50-55 mm, the starting range of this zoom lens equals that and then has the added versatility of zooming up to 135 mm (or 230mm in old style camera figures).  In my opinion, this added range of framing a shot gives the photographer so much more creativity, as well as being able to bring objects into closer, more intimate range.  I mentioned that this lens is good for 90% of all general camera shots; the missing 10% are those pictures that require a better zoom (more telephoto zoom), and those pics that need a wider field of view.  You may find that for group photos in close proximity, you want to take a step backwards to get everybody in the frame.  This is not a problem unless you simply don't have the room to take that step back.  I solved this problem by switching back to the original 18-55mm lens that came with the camera.  For the more distant shots that can't be drawn into the 135mm zoom of this lens I purchased a better telephoto zoom.2.  The lens has autofocus and IS stabilization technology.  For one used to manual focus lenses in SLR film photography, the addition of a fast autofocus lens is a terrific feature! I used to miss those spur of the moment shots because I was trying to achieve focus.  With this lens, you make those shots, because within a milisecond of depressing the shutter down halfway, the picture snaps into focus!  I absolutely love this feature!  The focuser has many points of potential focus, so it adapts easily to virtually all focusing situations.  For the really difficult focusing shots, there is the option of manual focusing.  While nice to have, I rarely use this option.  The Image Stabilization feature is a handy one in the longer shots.  ""IS"" lets one get away with a bit of camera shake without too much out-of-focus smear on the picture.  Canon does not recommend using the IS feature on tripod shots, so there is a switch to turn off the IS if desired.3.  The lens takes sharp clear pictures.  I have not been disappointed with the quality of the lens at all.Drawbacks1.  While there are not too many drawbacks to this lens, I think the major one is that the lens is bigger and heavier, in fact, much bigger and heavier than the standard 17-55 mm lenses that come with SLR cameras.  For me this is not a problem, however, for one that wants to have a lighter-weight camera, this could be considered a serious drawback.  On the other hand, a SLR camera like the Canon 20D or digital Rebel is not designed to be a smaller pocket-sized camera.  It is a larger format camera and of course the lenses will be larger (and heavier) as well.2.  Cost.  At just over 400 dollars, this lens is an investment.  Again, one has to weigh the obvious financial outlay, but the 28-135 mm lens is so superior to the cheaper 18-55 mm lens, that in my opinion, it is well worth the cost to upgrade.With this product, Canon made a great everyday camera lens.

Your guest just connect to your network and automatically get asked a password (which you can set, and which is NOT your regular Wifi password) and they're connected to the internet but NOT your network. I like this for three reasons: 1) I can change my guest network if I'm worried about neighbors or WiFi hijackers. 2) I can make my regular WiFi password much more complicated and thus stronger because my guests don't have to type it in; and 3) My guests can't get access to my files so I can remove one level of password protection from my networked computers.

Then I would like to see a master list of rules with an on/off button next to them. I have three daughters each with a computer, phone and ipod. Each has different needs for internet access because their school times are different and website access and times are different for different ages.The speed check utility needs to run on ipads.The device list manager needs to work more reliably, i.e. show all devices and then only once.I would really like to see a network map.Guest Network is great! I would love to see an email notification service so I get emails when guest sign in or out. Similar to my NAS sending me error messages.Overall I think this is a well functioning device.

The Creative adds a picture mode, but still has a similar arrangement of buttons, so it is not as easy to get it to do what you want.  With the Flip, the buttons are +/-, left/right, play/trash, record and power.

After all, the lens can be measured in millimeters.  It certainly exceeds the quality of my iPhone 3GS video, which is much lower in resolution (watch out for iPhone 4!, Flip).

I only have one piece of equipment(Video camera)that uses USB B and I could not perceive any difference between the transmission speed or quality between this cable and the one I had been using.  The cable does not have gold contacts which I believe to be of little value because the gold is usually gold plated at the minimum thickness possible.  All it takes is a few connections/disconnections to wear through the gold plating to the metal conductor unserlying the gold.  A high quality steel connector is better in the long run.  Also, the wire is not unusually thick which means that it may lose conductivity with longer cable runs.  This cable is only 10 feet long and therefore is probably well within the length where any loss of signal strength is likely to be incurred.  The plastic/rubber outer coating on the cabel is quite flexible which probably means the cable shielding within the wirea is also quite flexible.  I am a person that through experience does not throw money away on cabling and I would suggest one spend the time understanding learning what types and quality of cable are necessary to produce virtually lossless sound.  For digital signals, a reasonably price cable is probably more than enough.  For non-amplified analog signals, good cable is necessary.  For amplified analog signals, regular priced shielded cable should suffice.  For unamplified signals such as electric guitar, a lower guage high quality shielded cable is absolutely necessary, particularly if you are usinf a cable of 25 feet or more.

I only have one piece of equipment(Video camera)that uses USB B and I could not perceive any difference between the transmission speed or quality between this cable and the one I had been using.  The cable does not have gold contacts which I believe to be of little value because the gold is usually gold plated at the minimum thickness possible.  All it takes is a few connections/disconnections to wear through the gold plating to the metal conductor unserlying the gold.  A high quality steel connector is better in the long run.  Also, the wire is not unusually thick which means that it may lose conductivity with longer cable runs.  This cable is only 10 feet long and therefore is probably well within the length where any loss of signal strength is likely to be incurred.  The plastic/rubber outer coating on the cabel is quite flexible which probably means the cable shielding within the wirea is also quite flexible.  I am a person that through experience does not throw money away on cabling and I would suggest one spend the time understanding learning what types and quality of cable are necessary to produce virtually lossless sound.  For digital signals, a reasonably price cable is probably more than enough.  For non-amplified analog signals, good cable is necessary.  For amplified analog signals, regular priced shielded cable should suffice.  For unamplified signals such as electric guitar, a lower guage high quality shielded cable is absolutely necessary, particularly if you are usinf a cable of 25 feet or more.

I had heard that the new software (Cisco Cloud Connect) was very intuitive and easy to use, despite some early controversy about it.  By the way, many of the 1 star reviews are based on concerns about privacy that have been put to rest by the manufacturer.This router is among a select few ""state of the art"" routers offering multiple but simultaneous operation on both the 2.4 and 5.0GHz bands - each band is capable of 3 streams (connections). This is a so called 900 router (the current gold standard for home routers).Much has been written about the new software - some of which was full of praise (including a glowing CNET review) and some of which is quite damning (including many 1 star reviews here on Amazon). The bottom line is that this software is wonderfully easy to use and any concerns that Cisco might be monitoring your internet activity have been put to rest by the manufacturer. Cisco has revised and clarified their policies to make it abundantly clear that this is a NON ISSUE. See Cisco's remarks posted right here on Amazon. So many of these 1 star reviews are quite dated.Also remember that Cisco allows you to opt out of this software altogether and administer your router locally with no connection to Cisco or the cloud (internet).What we have here is a ""top of the line"" advanced router that is very easy to set up thanks to its intuitive software.  That is exactly what I wanted ---- because routers can be quite difficult to setup/manage, particularly the very best (and most advanced) ones. The EA 4500 is very easy to setup and is a true ""set and forget"" type of device.So, what is not to like? The software and router are great and the fact that it can be managed in the cloud (meaning the router can be accessed via the internet) is largely unimportant. You will, most likely, just like me, simply set it up (using all or most of the simple software defaults) and forget about it! But for those of you who have the rare need to manage a router once it is set up , then you can access your router via any internet connection if you have passed Cisco's extensive security measures.As of August, 2012, the other competing routers you should look at are the Asus RT-N66U, WD (Western Digital) N900 and the Netgear R6300. I based my choice on Cisco's very intuitive software and very good range. While it may not always be the best (according to professional reviews), it has a better than average range.What may confuse many future buyers is that there is a new DRAFT (meaning far from finished) standard that is coming to Wi-Fi and routers. You will see, no doubt, many new routers coming to market boosting of conformance to the ""draft"" or the unfinished AC standard (802.11ac). The fact that NO clients (meaning there is NOT ONE real world receiving device) that exists for this new and yet to be finished standard is never pointed out. While meaningless, every router manufacturer will start to bring out new devices, or firmware upgrades to claim  ""compliance"" to this new DRAFT standard of AC. You can, at least for the next couple of years, largely ignore this spec.If you want a high performance router that simultaneously operates on both bands, can easily handle 3 simultaneous signals per band and works with all current standards and devices - then this is the one for you. If you want a set and forget type of device that is easy to setup ---this is also the one for you. Highly recommended.I should add this router also creates a GUEST network (a network that can never access your home files).Yet, if friends come over, they will be greeted with an easy Wi-Fi connection. You can turn off this feature easily in the setup but it is a real convenience that most people will like.  Frankly, I doubt there will be many that turn it off since it is both secure and really convenient for guests. Yet to be fair, most other new high end routers now also offer this same feature. So it is not unique to this router yet a welcome addition to the feature set of most newer high end routers.I'm hesitant to give performance figures. What I can say is that I have a large home. This router is located on the second story of my home, in the north most corner. I routinely connect on the first floor, on the south most corner, with excellent results. By accident, I had created a worse case scenario - yet I get top-notch results. There may be even better performing routers available but I'll take the easy set-up of this one versus all comers.I guess you could say I am happy with my purchase.

The kind you don't have to argue about. It's there in quantity for any need you might have. That aside, I see this SRMT as 2 headphones in one (a bargain BTW) - the extra-bass model for gaming, TV action film, house and other bass-centric music, and the hi-fi model (using bass reduction) for symphonies, folk and acoustic, jazz, rock/pop/metal, and other such delicate genres. Unless otherwise noted, all comments below apply to the SRMT using bass reduction, since I listen to music only, and my tastes are mostly towards neutral reproduction.The SRMT sounds to me like a blend of two other headphones I have - the Marshall Monitor and the Beats Mixr. The SRMT's bass is extra strong like the Mixr, and when bass reduction is used, still has a stronger bass (including the deep bass) than most so-called high fidelity headphones. The rest of the range above the upper bass sounds more like the Marshall - darker than the Mixr, especially in the &#34;presence&#34; region or lower treble. Most other reviews I've read of the SRMT don't describe the sound very precisely, comparing to other known references like the Mixr, or even the old school headphones like the Sennheiser and Beyer models. I have a feeling that any critical reviews of the SRMT by the best-known establishment reviewers will find the combination of extra strong bass and some shyness in the lower treble - that will take points off of their ratings for this headphone.In my case, using bass reduction for critical listening at home, the balance is perfect, or as near perfect as anything else I have, and that's excellent. The sound overall has a darker tonality than the average headphone, including the Beats Mixr, and it's about the same as the Marshall Monitor. The reasons I believe the SRMT is a 2-headphones-in-1 bargain is because 1) The SRMT's sound using bass reduction is excellent, with no bothersome peaks or dips anywhere in the music frequency spectrum; 2) The sound played flat (no EQ) provides the extra bass that gets lost in many portable use situations - outdoors or on public transport for example; and 3) Where most &#34;bassy&#34; headphones don't have the extra strength in the deep bass that they have in the upper bass, and using bass reduction with those headphones results in a weak lower bass, the SRMT's lower bass remains solid with good impact. The only other headphones I recall having this good of a bass response are the v-moda M100 and the Beats Mixr.The overall sound of the SRMT is very smooth from top to bottom. Unlike some reviewers who go into minute detail about the many aspects of sound the customer is likely to experience with their new headphone, I stick to the things I can explain - the things that anyone can hear on their music player, computer, or portable headphone amp etc. Besides having a bass response that's solid and detailed (given the things I noted above), and a midrange that's just right (neither forward nor recessed), the SRMT's treble is also ideal - just strong enough with enough detail for reproducing the fine upper harmonic detail in voices and instruments, but not so strong as to make sibilants or other treble irritations from lower-quality music tracks bothersome. I rarely say anything about amps except that they improve the sense of space or &#34;air&#34;, but with the SRMT and my USB DAC/amps, the highs dried up more than when playing with the iPod alone, and I got better results with the FiiO E07k through the 'Aux' port.The SRMT's soundstage seems at least average, which is good for a closed-back headphone. Isolation also seems average for a closed headphone, and the leakage is low - low enough that playing the SRMT at a moderate volume level in a cubicle next to other cubicles in a quiet office should not be a problem. The music track examples listed below will tell my impressions of the SRMT's sound with that particular music. If you should happen to read other reviews on the SRMT that describe either the mids or treble as recessed, consider that those reviewers are playing the SRMT with the bass full up and that I'm using bass reduction. The reason I'm not reviewing the sound of the SRMT played flat (no EQ) is because many other reviewers have already done that, and I want to provide an alternative for customers who'd like to have a headphone like the SRMT, but wouldn't like extra-strong bass.The SRMT comes in several colors, and my video review shows the plain black version I purchased. The SRMT seems to be mostly plastic, including the headband I think, but the headbands are user-replaceable and are easily found at retail stores. I consider the build quality to be as good as the sound - excellent. The earcups are circumaural (around-ear), and they fit around my average or larger size ears with great comfort. There are 2 main classes of circumaural earcups in my experience - the large round cups like the Beyerdynamic DT770 and other Beyer series, or the Soundmagic HP100 and HP200, to name some examples. Then there are the smaller oval earcups/earpads like the Sennheiser Momentum, the Phiaton MS400, the v-moda M100, and the SRMT. The SRMT fits me better with greater comfort than any of these other small oval earcup/earpad designs.The headband clamp is fairly light for this type of headphone, and it's also very secure on the head, but the snug and secure fit may have a price - in very warm weather the earcups may feel overly warm. The 4-ft. straight cable is detachable and double-side entry, and the 2.5mm plug that goes into each earcup looks like a stereo plug, although the extra connector may have something to do with the start/stop and volume controls. The other end for the computer or music player is an Apple-style right-angle miniplug. The SRMT doesn't come with any sort of carry case, just a thin plastic-coated bag that won't protect the headphone from anything. If you need to take this headphone with you to various places and you don't want to wear it around your neck (that works very well BTW), I'd advise taking it apart - earcups and headband and cable - and packing them into whatever protective container you can find.In other reviews I've done I've included the following music examples with comments about how the headphones sound with each track. My suggestion is instead of reading each one as an absolute unto itself, you could compare my notes here to other reviews and see how the SRMT compares with each individual track. I copied these examples from my Beats Mixr review and then went through each one in a listening session, checking for any differences I heard from what I reported for the Mixr, and found only one or two minor differences - an excellent result. The SRMT is now one of my 4 favorite headphones, which includes the Beats Mixr, the Marshall Monitor, and the v-moda M100.Animotion - Obsession (1980's New Wave/Techno): The upper bass synth should have good detail and tone, and both male and female vocals should sound natural, without favoring either. The SRMT plays this perfectly.Ben Heit Quartet - Suite-Magnet and Iron (Jazz with a Bebop flavor): The piano that leads off should sound realistic, and the sax should sound soft. The SRMT plays this music extremely well.Cath Carroll - Moves Like You (1980's New Wave/Techno): This track's percussion and voice should be crisp and well-balanced, and there should be a good sense of space or soundstage around the voices and instruments. The SRMT reproduces the space and detail very well.Chromatics - I'm On Fire (Synth-Pop, female lead): Another track with plenty of space around the voice and instruments, making for a very pleasant stereo image. The voice sounds good and the tambourine in the background is clearly identifiable.Crystal Castles - Wrath of God (Electro-Pop): The moderate level of bass in this track should reproduce with good detail, and the ambient electronic effects should maintain their separation and never congeal into a glassy, hard, or &#34;ringy&#34; sound as some headphones might produce if they have uncorrected resonances. The SRMT does this one just right.DJ Shadow - Building Steam With a Grain of Salt (Electronic/DJ): This track opens with what sounds like very high and very low piano notes, and those high notes particularly might ring a few resonances in lesser headphones. The SRMT handles those notes well, and reproduces the ambient voices with good tone and balance.Franz Ferdinand - Ulysses (Pop-Rock): The moderate level of bass in this track should reproduce with good detail, and the percussion and voice should be crisp and well-balanced. The SRMT makes this sound like what I imagine the original producers heard when they mixed it.Halie Loren - Sway (Jazz vocal): Bass instrument(s) here may sound boomy with some headphones, but the SRMT handles this perfectly. The trumpet should sound natural but soft, and the voice should have the right presence without sounding recessed or too forward. The SRMT does a great job in both respects.Hans Zimmer - Dark Knight-Aggressive Expansion (Soundtrack): The percussion hits hard here, and the SRMT handles it well. The bass tones beginning around 0:45 into the track are the ultra-deep &#34;shuddery&#34; kind that require good deep bass response from a headphone, and the SRMT reproduces those deep notes even with bass reduction enabled as described above.Kaskade - 4am (Electro-House): The bass that kicks in around 1:01 into the track is subtle, but the SRMT gets it right. The percussion and female voice should balance well with neither overwriting the other, and the SRMT aces this.Katy B - Perfect Stranger (R&B-House-Garage;): The heavy bass that begins at 0:27 into this track is played very well by the SRMT. The voice is slightly forward, but it doesn't overpower the instruments or get lost in the mix. The SRMT balances the different elements in this music extremely well.Machine Gun Kelly - All We Have (Rap/Hip-Hop): The heavy bass beats that begin at 0:23 into the track should sound like drum impacts, although they're not sharp impacts. The male and female voices should have a good balance and not overpower the music or sound recessed. The SRMT plays this as good as can be expected given the limited quality of the recording.Massive Attack - Angel (Trip-Hop): This track begins with a steady low-frequency sound and some solid deep-bass impacts. The voices should blend well with the music and have just the right presence, although the recorded quality of the instruments isn't great. The SRMT plays this as good as can be expected given the limited quality of the recording.Morcheeba - Bullet Proof (Trip-Hop): Bright percussion and medium-strength bass impacts make up most of this, with some dance-club spoken intonations thrown in. The SRMT renders the percussion treble correctly (not too bright, not harsh), and the voices sound just right.Peter Tosh - Get Up Stand Up (Reggae): The bass here has a decent but moderate impact, and the lead and backup voices have good separation that's not too narrow or wide. The SRMT renders the bass with good detail and the voices sound very natural.Porcupine Tree - Trains (Pop-Rock): This track opens with some detailed string sounds and a forward-sounding male voice with a higher-than-average register. There are also some &#34;clip-clop&#34; effects starting at 3:19 that should sound like they were made with wooden blocks of some kind. The SRMT reproduces all of these sounds faithfully.Rachmaninoff - Prelude in C-Sharp Minor Op3 No2 (Classical, Piano): Grand piano played mechanically from an original recording by the master himself. The bass is light here, but the piano tone is good quality, and the SRMT plays these notes very well.Scarlatti-Kipnis - Sonata in E Major K381 (Classical, Harpsichord): The harpsichord here is fairly bright and highly detailed, and the SRMT renders the tones and transients superbly.Trombone Shorty - Backatown (Jazz-Funk): The deep bass impacts here are unusually strong, and work very well with the horns and other instruments. The SRMT delivers the impacts with proper weight, and makes the horns sound real.William Orbit - Optical Illusion (Billy Buttons Mix) (Electronic): This is about as close as I want to get to easy-listening music. The string(?) tones beginning at 0:18 are subtle, but clearly reproduced by the SRMT. The bass isn't very strong, but still adds a good underpinning to the music. The short poetic rap at 4:14, preceded by an etherial female voice, sounds so perfect that this track could easily have been mixed using the SRMT headphone.

The reasons I believe the SRMT is a 2-headphones-in-1 bargain is because 1) The SRMT's sound using bass reduction is excellent, with no bothersome peaks or dips anywhere in the music frequency spectrum; 2) The sound played flat (no EQ) provides the extra bass that gets lost in many portable use situations - outdoors or on public transport for example; and 3) Where most &#34;bassy&#34; headphones don't have the extra strength in the deep bass that they have in the upper bass, and using bass reduction with those headphones results in a weak lower bass, the SRMT's lower bass remains solid with good impact. The only other headphones I recall having this good of a bass response are the v-moda M100 and the Beats Mixr.The overall sound of the SRMT is very smooth from top to bottom. Unlike some reviewers who go into minute detail about the many aspects of sound the customer is likely to experience with their new headphone, I stick to the things I can explain - the things that anyone can hear on their music player, computer, or portable headphone amp etc. Besides having a bass response that's solid and detailed (given the things I noted above), and a midrange that's just right (neither forward nor recessed), the SRMT's treble is also ideal - just strong enough with enough detail for reproducing the fine upper harmonic detail in voices and instruments, but not so strong as to make sibilants or other treble irritations from lower-quality music tracks bothersome. I rarely say anything about amps except that they improve the sense of space or &#34;air&#34;, but with the SRMT and my USB DAC/amps, the highs dried up more than when playing with the iPod alone, and I got better results with the FiiO E07k through the 'Aux' port.The SRMT's soundstage seems at least average, which is good for a closed-back headphone. Isolation also seems average for a closed headphone, and the leakage is low - low enough that playing the SRMT at a moderate volume level in a cubicle next to other cubicles in a quiet office should not be a problem. The music track examples listed below will tell my impressions of the SRMT's sound with that particular music. If you should happen to read other reviews on the SRMT that describe either the mids or treble as recessed, consider that those reviewers are playing the SRMT with the bass full up and that I'm using bass reduction. The reason I'm not reviewing the sound of the SRMT played flat (no EQ) is because many other reviewers have already done that, and I want to provide an alternative for customers who'd like to have a headphone like the SRMT, but wouldn't like extra-strong bass.The SRMT comes in several colors, and my video review shows the plain black version I purchased. The SRMT seems to be mostly plastic, including the headband I think, but the headbands are user-replaceable and are easily found at retail stores. I consider the build quality to be as good as the sound - excellent. The earcups are circumaural (around-ear), and they fit around my average or larger size ears with great comfort. There are 2 main classes of circumaural earcups in my experience - the large round cups like the Beyerdynamic DT770 and other Beyer series, or the Soundmagic HP100 and HP200, to name some examples. Then there are the smaller oval earcups/earpads like the Sennheiser Momentum, the Phiaton MS400, the v-moda M100, and the SRMT. The SRMT fits me better with greater comfort than any of these other small oval earcup/earpad designs.The headband clamp is fairly light for this type of headphone, and it's also very secure on the head, but the snug and secure fit may have a price - in very warm weather the earcups may feel overly warm. The 4-ft. straight cable is detachable and double-side entry, and the 2.5mm plug that goes into each earcup looks like a stereo plug, although the extra connector may have something to do with the start/stop and volume controls. The other end for the computer or music player is an Apple-style right-angle miniplug. The SRMT doesn't come with any sort of carry case, just a thin plastic-coated bag that won't protect the headphone from anything. If you need to take this headphone with you to various places and you don't want to wear it around your neck (that works very well BTW), I'd advise taking it apart - earcups and headband and cable - and packing them into whatever protective container you can find.In other reviews I've done I've included the following music examples with comments about how the headphones sound with each track. My suggestion is instead of reading each one as an absolute unto itself, you could compare my notes here to other reviews and see how the SRMT compares with each individual track. I copied these examples from my Beats Mixr review and then went through each one in a listening session, checking for any differences I heard from what I reported for the Mixr, and found only one or two minor differences - an excellent result. The SRMT is now one of my 4 favorite headphones, which includes the Beats Mixr, the Marshall Monitor, and the v-moda M100.Animotion - Obsession (1980's New Wave/Techno): The upper bass synth should have good detail and tone, and both male and female vocals should sound natural, without favoring either. The SRMT plays this perfectly.Ben Heit Quartet - Suite-Magnet and Iron (Jazz with a Bebop flavor): The piano that leads off should sound realistic, and the sax should sound soft. The SRMT plays this music extremely well.Cath Carroll - Moves Like You (1980's New Wave/Techno): This track's percussion and voice should be crisp and well-balanced, and there should be a good sense of space or soundstage around the voices and instruments. The SRMT reproduces the space and detail very well.Chromatics - I'm On Fire (Synth-Pop, female lead): Another track with plenty of space around the voice and instruments, making for a very pleasant stereo image. The voice sounds good and the tambourine in the background is clearly identifiable.Crystal Castles - Wrath of God (Electro-Pop): The moderate level of bass in this track should reproduce with good detail, and the ambient electronic effects should maintain their separation and never congeal into a glassy, hard, or &#34;ringy&#34; sound as some headphones might produce if they have uncorrected resonances. The SRMT does this one just right.DJ Shadow - Building Steam With a Grain of Salt (Electronic/DJ): This track opens with what sounds like very high and very low piano notes, and those high notes particularly might ring a few resonances in lesser headphones. The SRMT handles those notes well, and reproduces the ambient voices with good tone and balance.Franz Ferdinand - Ulysses (Pop-Rock): The moderate level of bass in this track should reproduce with good detail, and the percussion and voice should be crisp and well-balanced. The SRMT makes this sound like what I imagine the original producers heard when they mixed it.Halie Loren - Sway (Jazz vocal): Bass instrument(s) here may sound boomy with some headphones, but the SRMT handles this perfectly. The trumpet should sound natural but soft, and the voice should have the right presence without sounding recessed or too forward. The SRMT does a great job in both respects.Hans Zimmer - Dark Knight-Aggressive Expansion (Soundtrack): The percussion hits hard here, and the SRMT handles it well. The bass tones beginning around 0:45 into the track are the ultra-deep &#34;shuddery&#34; kind that require good deep bass response from a headphone, and the SRMT reproduces those deep notes even with bass reduction enabled as described above.Kaskade - 4am (Electro-House): The bass that kicks in around 1:01 into the track is subtle, but the SRMT gets it right. The percussion and female voice should balance well with neither overwriting the other, and the SRMT aces this.Katy B - Perfect Stranger (R&B-House-Garage;): The heavy bass that begins at 0:27 into this track is played very well by the SRMT. The voice is slightly forward, but it doesn't overpower the instruments or get lost in the mix. The SRMT balances the different elements in this music extremely well.Machine Gun Kelly - All We Have (Rap/Hip-Hop): The heavy bass beats that begin at 0:23 into the track should sound like drum impacts, although they're not sharp impacts. The male and female voices should have a good balance and not overpower the music or sound recessed. The SRMT plays this as good as can be expected given the limited quality of the recording.Massive Attack - Angel (Trip-Hop): This track begins with a steady low-frequency sound and some solid deep-bass impacts. The voices should blend well with the music and have just the right presence, although the recorded quality of the instruments isn't great. The SRMT plays this as good as can be expected given the limited quality of the recording.Morcheeba - Bullet Proof (Trip-Hop): Bright percussion and medium-strength bass impacts make up most of this, with some dance-club spoken intonations thrown in. The SRMT renders the percussion treble correctly (not too bright, not harsh), and the voices sound just right.Peter Tosh - Get Up Stand Up (Reggae): The bass here has a decent but moderate impact, and the lead and backup voices have good separation that's not too narrow or wide. The SRMT renders the bass with good detail and the voices sound very natural.Porcupine Tree - Trains (Pop-Rock): This track opens with some detailed string sounds and a forward-sounding male voice with a higher-than-average register. There are also some &#34;clip-clop&#34; effects starting at 3:19 that should sound like they were made with wooden blocks of some kind. The SRMT reproduces all of these sounds faithfully.Rachmaninoff - Prelude in C-Sharp Minor Op3 No2 (Classical, Piano): Grand piano played mechanically from an original recording by the master himself. The bass is light here, but the piano tone is good quality, and the SRMT plays these notes very well.Scarlatti-Kipnis - Sonata in E Major K381 (Classical, Harpsichord): The harpsichord here is fairly bright and highly detailed, and the SRMT renders the tones and transients superbly.Trombone Shorty - Backatown (Jazz-Funk): The deep bass impacts here are unusually strong, and work very well with the horns and other instruments. The SRMT delivers the impacts with proper weight, and makes the horns sound real.William Orbit - Optical Illusion (Billy Buttons Mix) (Electronic): This is about as close as I want to get to easy-listening music. The string(?) tones beginning at 0:18 are subtle, but clearly reproduced by the SRMT. The bass isn't very strong, but still adds a good underpinning to the music. The short poetic rap at 4:14, preceded by an etherial female voice, sounds so perfect that this track could easily have been mixed using the SRMT headphone.

Though for me, I at times wore around my neck, and these are not comfortable; so if you imagine yourself wearing them around your neck at all they are not good.Wrap-up:For the price these are absolutely great headphones; the sound alone competes comparably with the more expensive phones out there.

It's an excellent improvement over the Airbender 2.0.  The Airbender Pro has a thick and very protective rubber case that protects the iPad Air and the bluetooth keyboard.  It's somewhat thick, which helps to make it extra protective.  It protects all the ports and has a built in screen protector.  It also has holes for the speakers so you can still listen to music.  The case is shock and water resistant.  It is not water proof.  It would be really great to have a waterproof case.  If I am outside in the snow or rain and want to use my iPad, it would be nice to have it in a waterproof case.  The bluetooth keyboard is a full keyboard.  It pairs easily with the iPad Air.  It's very easy to type on.  The keys are comfortable.  It could use a mouse.

This case would be great for anyone in any occupation that needs a bluetooth keyboard for their iPad Air and a protective case.  This case really turns the iPad Air into a mini laptop.  I have gotten several really nice compliments from co-workers about how attractive the case is and how useful it is.  This case has a really rugged metal arm that won't break like the plastic arms that some of the cases have.  With this protective case on my iPad Air, I feel that I can take it more places.  It's also more usable with the keyboard.  Sometimes the bluetooth keyboard does make my iPad freeze up when I check my email on Microsoft Exchange.  Other than that the keyboard has been great.  Sometimes if I let the iPad sit for awhile, it will lose its connectivity to the bluetooth keyboard and I have to reconnect.  I give this case and keyboard a rating of 4 out of 5 stars.  This is definitely an excellent improvement over the Airbender 2.0.  The case on the Airbender 2.0 was thin and flimsy.  The Airbender Pro is awesome, durable, and rugged.

MicroSD cards have no write-protect tab, so I was quite surprised and worried by this.  After failing to find any workable solution by searching online, I finally put it in my Chromebook and created a new folder on it there, then stuck it back in my Windows PC and it no longer gave me a write-protect error.  If anyone has a similar problem, I'd recommend doing something similar by putting it in any other PC, laptop, camera, etc you have available and try writing to it there.----------------------------------------------This portion of my review is necessarily being written as an update to my original review of the 64 GB version of this card, since Amazon disallows multiple reviews for what they consider the same item.  This portion concerns the 128 GB version of this card:I don't need a fast card, so the speeds on this card were not that important, besides which my test PC is not exactly high-end. Therefore I didn't count off for the speed results I got below, using a USB 2.0 card adapter, but I thought they might be relevant to some readers. While the card did reach the Class-10 and/or UHS-I requirements, it came in at under 2/3 of the claimed ""read speeds up to 30 MB/s for fast file transfer.""

I did not because of the way Amazon markets the case on their site probably clarifies what you are buying. The key here is THINNESS!  And many people love a thin LIGHT case. Amazon designed this case to be the thinnest, and Amazon may very well have achieved that.  I think this is a good thing. So good, that I have given this case 5 stars.  Just know, you are buying thin.5 stars for thin and protective case... about half an inch with the FireHD 8.9.  (hard to measure, I need calipers!). I will tell you why I think some of the one star ratings are given...and they fall in two areas: One, the case looks cheap when you see the lower half inside. Two, the case can not be propped at a low angle to one's desk and still type well on it. We will look at both of these items... there are, I am sure, other reasons for low rankings, some due to perceptions of ""a good case.""First, everyone has (perhaps) their own perceptions of what a good case is:  My brother has a big Otterbox case (sturdy, shock resistant case) on his thin cell phone. I do not... I have a thin, easy to grip case. Why? Is it because I don't want my phone (and tablet) protected?  Sure I do.  But I am an adult, and I know how to take care of things. The case is there, just in case. :) But, I don't need to protect it to the level of an OtterBox case, in my view.  So that is my preference. If this is not your preference, you are going to hate this thin, beautiful case.Amazon advertises thin, and they deliver thin. And I agree with those who think if they wanted a one inch thick case around their tablet, they would have a netbook or similar, not a tablet (since tablets should be thin and light).  But... but... but... (you may object)...Yes, I know. This case doesn't look like a 50 bucks+ case.  In fact, many have said it is not even leather. I don't know for certainty, but I don't doubt that it is leather. But let me describe the construction and you will see. And why does the bottom half look like it is just plastic!? Read on.The case is a very light plastic shell... and this very thin shell can be seen on the inside of the lower half, so the perception is cheapness. But, the question should be, what is the purpose of this case and what is being accomplished by this plastic? In short, it is providing needed protection and absorbtion for drops around every square inch of the tablet... notice the complete wrap around, form-fitting shape on the bottom half.  Look closely at the bottom half, which has been structured to fit the Fire HD 8.9 like a glove, with perfectly cut openings and stylish design), on the outside of this casing is a wrap around leather covering. Once your tablet is in this case, you never see the plastic, as it is holding your Fire HD 8.9. Then, on top of the shell is a thin, very thin, leather covering that looks like it has been steam fit and glued on top of the plastic. Then a black thread has sewn the edges down so I doubt it would ever come loose.  By necessity then, the leather is not soft to the touch, since it is attached to a plastic shell.  But, it is very likely leather and the reason some think it is all plastic is because of the shell material.The sizing to the actual Kindle Fire HD is what is so amazing.  The bottom of the plastic case just snaps over the bottom of the Fire and then the top lays on the glass of the tablet. Magnets (with Auto Wake and Sleep) keep the case shut (though it might not be good enough to stay shut in a fall).THIN AND LIGHT?Now, I purchased a Moko Case from Amazon too. It was thin, as was my preference.  My Moko Case is about 5/8 of an inch with tablet). This case is 1/2 inch, plus maybe a tad more than half an inch. But, clearly, this case is thinnest of any case that I have seen.Is it lightest?  IT IS NOT. My Moco case is lighter, even though it is tad thicker. Why?  This Amazon case wraps completely around the entire tablet (it doesn't leave any edges exposed. My Moco case does. Still, the slightly thicker padding on the Moco probably provides a bit more protection... but who knows... I am not going to drop test. :) Suffice it to say they are both thin and light weight. One a tad more than the other in each area.THE STAND:The stand on this case has been where many people have commented. Here is my take.First, the stand does work well.  It may not be the best if you like to type on your tablet in a standing mode (as finger pressure would certainly knock the stand over on some surfaces).Remember thin? Well, one thing that makes many cases thicker is the stand mechanism.  Make the stand (or base) too thick and it adds bulk. Make it too thin and it just doesn't stay up.  So, this was the design challenge.  Amazon went with a LACK OF A BASE for their stand.... as well as a lack of a Kick-0ut stand mechanism.  How does it work?  Simple, just fold it over and let the case form a A shape that supports the tablet to stand. Oh, I can hear it now. ""That won't work reliably!""  Well, what they did is make the outer edge side out of a sticky, rubbery material, so that when you prop it opens, it holds quite nicely.  This saves them a lot of weight and thickness. Some don't like it... but I imagine it is people that want to type on the tablet with it propped up in standing position. I think that if the feet are kept fairly clean, they will grab onto any descent surface and hold the tablet upright... and at about any angle that you want.I like this case. I like the design. I like the thinness. The jury still out on the stand (over time) and the magnetic closure (during a potential fall).  I can't do less than five stars, because it does everything it states. Yes, I like my Moco case a bit better, but I bet this case will still be going strong long after my Moco case needs to be replaced.  And now I have a wonderful replacement.JJI will update this review over time.Update: One con is the interior material of the case (the part that hits the screen)...it is not super-soft Micro-fiber cloth, rather a thin cloth that doesn't scratch the screen. A Microfber cloth interior might help keep the screen cleaner, but it would have added thickness. I have seen one reviewer say that cat hairs stick to it. I have not had that problem, and we do have a cat.Update: Price vs. Quality.  Boy, I really wanted to stay out of this discussion. Everyone has their own comfort level with price, so I just try to review the product. But yes, if you are looking at cases in the sub-20 market, this case is pricey in comparison. But, I doubt that anyone who wanted the features of this case, would then think the given price was too much to pay. Key features again?Protective covering that covers the entire tabletConnects to the tablet all the way around, so it isn't going to pop out.Very thin (the thinnest?) and exceedingly lightExtremely easy to open, use, get access to all ports... and even easy to remove, if needed... all while being thin and attractiveLove the wonderful design for the volume rocker and power button. Nice design makes these a breeze to use (unlike my cell phone case).Leather coating (though not soft) seems durable and easy to grip.Speaker vents are perhaps the best I have seen on any case... it doesn't limit sound.Stand is simple and quick to use, because it uses a rubbery material that simply clings to most (but not all) material (I have tried on wood and formica top desks, table cloth, papers on top of a desk (not as good, but works), glass top tables, and wood and ceramic floors). The only time this failed was when I had it on the side of some rubbermaid containers... slipped on that slicker, dustier surface). You can get a nearly straight up position fairly readily, the only real issue is with a low angle such some people like for typing on a tablet. If the surface isn't ideal, the tablet will simply slip down to the table (flat), when you try to type. The benefit is that you have just about every other angle (degree) that you might want to have. That is great if your trying to avoid a glare on the screen, for instance. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(8120, 8134)",2,0.0,False

We will look at both of these items... there are, I am sure, other reasons for low rankings, some due to perceptions of ""a good case.""First, everyone has (perhaps) their own perceptions of what a good case is:  My brother has a big Otterbox case (sturdy, shock resistant case) on his thin cell phone. I do not... I have a thin, easy to grip case. Why? Is it because I don't want my phone (and tablet) protected?  Sure I do.  But I am an adult, and I know how to take care of things. The case is there, just in case. :) But, I don't need to protect it to the level of an OtterBox case, in my view.  So that is my preference. If this is not your preference, you are going to hate this thin, beautiful case.Amazon advertises thin, and they deliver thin. And I agree with those who think if they wanted a one inch thick case around their tablet, they would have a netbook or similar, not a tablet (since tablets should be thin and light).  But... but... but... (you may object)...Yes, I know. This case doesn't look like a 50 bucks+ case.  In fact, many have said it is not even leather. I don't know for certainty, but I don't doubt that it is leather. But let me describe the construction and you will see. And why does the bottom half look like it is just plastic!? Read on.The case is a very light plastic shell... and this very thin shell can be seen on the inside of the lower half, so the perception is cheapness. But, the question should be, what is the purpose of this case and what is being accomplished by this plastic? In short, it is providing needed protection and absorbtion for drops around every square inch of the tablet... notice the complete wrap around, form-fitting shape on the bottom half.  Look closely at the bottom half, which has been structured to fit the Fire HD 8.9 like a glove, with perfectly cut openings and stylish design), on the outside of this casing is a wrap around leather covering. Once your tablet is in this case, you never see the plastic, as it is holding your Fire HD 8.9. Then, on top of the shell is a thin, very thin, leather covering that looks like it has been steam fit and glued on top of the plastic. Then a black thread has sewn the edges down so I doubt it would ever come loose.  By necessity then, the leather is not soft to the touch, since it is attached to a plastic shell.  But, it is very likely leather and the reason some think it is all plastic is because of the shell material.The sizing to the actual Kindle Fire HD is what is so amazing.  The bottom of the plastic case just snaps over the bottom of the Fire and then the top lays on the glass of the tablet. Magnets (with Auto Wake and Sleep) keep the case shut (though it might not be good enough to stay shut in a fall).THIN AND LIGHT?Now, I purchased a Moko Case from Amazon too. It was thin, as was my preference.  My Moko Case is about 5/8 of an inch with tablet). This case is 1/2 inch, plus maybe a tad more than half an inch. But, clearly, this case is thinnest of any case that I have seen.Is it lightest?  IT IS NOT. My Moco case is lighter, even though it is tad thicker. Why?  This Amazon case wraps completely around the entire tablet (it doesn't leave any edges exposed. My Moco case does. Still, the slightly thicker padding on the Moco probably provides a bit more protection... but who knows... I am not going to drop test. :) Suffice it to say they are both thin and light weight. One a tad more than the other in each area.THE STAND:The stand on this case has been where many people have commented. Here is my take.First, the stand does work well.  It may not be the best if you like to type on your tablet in a standing mode (as finger pressure would certainly knock the stand over on some surfaces).Remember thin? Well, one thing that makes many cases thicker is the stand mechanism.  Make the stand (or base) too thick and it adds bulk. Make it too thin and it just doesn't stay up.  So, this was the design challenge.  Amazon went with a LACK OF A BASE for their stand.... as well as a lack of a Kick-0ut stand mechanism.  How does it work?  Simple, just fold it over and let the case form a A shape that supports the tablet to stand. Oh, I can hear it now. ""That won't work reliably!""  Well, what they did is make the outer edge side out of a sticky, rubbery material, so that when you prop it opens, it holds quite nicely.  This saves them a lot of weight and thickness. Some don't like it... but I imagine it is people that want to type on the tablet with it propped up in standing position. I think that if the feet are kept fairly clean, they will grab onto any descent surface and hold the tablet upright... and at about any angle that you want.I like this case. I like the design. I like the thinness. The jury still out on the stand (over time) and the magnetic closure (during a potential fall).  I can't do less than five stars, because it does everything it states. Yes, I like my Moco case a bit better, but I bet this case will still be going strong long after my Moco case needs to be replaced.  And now I have a wonderful replacement.JJI will update this review over time.Update: One con is the interior material of the case (the part that hits the screen)...it is not super-soft Micro-fiber cloth, rather a thin cloth that doesn't scratch the screen. A Microfber cloth interior might help keep the screen cleaner, but it would have added thickness. I have seen one reviewer say that cat hairs stick to it. I have not had that problem, and we do have a cat.Update: Price vs. Quality.  Boy, I really wanted to stay out of this discussion. Everyone has their own comfort level with price, so I just try to review the product. But yes, if you are looking at cases in the sub-20 market, this case is pricey in comparison. But, I doubt that anyone who wanted the features of this case, would then think the given price was too much to pay. Key features again?Protective covering that covers the entire tabletConnects to the tablet all the way around, so it isn't going to pop out.Very thin (the thinnest?) and exceedingly lightExtremely easy to open, use, get access to all ports... and even easy to remove, if needed... all while being thin and attractiveLove the wonderful design for the volume rocker and power button. Nice design makes these a breeze to use (unlike my cell phone case).Leather coating (though not soft) seems durable and easy to grip.Speaker vents are perhaps the best I have seen on any case... it doesn't limit sound.Stand is simple and quick to use, because it uses a rubbery material that simply clings to most (but not all) material (I have tried on wood and formica top desks, table cloth, papers on top of a desk (not as good, but works), glass top tables, and wood and ceramic floors). The only time this failed was when I had it on the side of some rubbermaid containers... slipped on that slicker, dustier surface). You can get a nearly straight up position fairly readily, the only real issue is with a low angle such some people like for typing on a tablet. If the surface isn't ideal, the tablet will simply slip down to the table (flat), when you try to type. The benefit is that you have just about every other angle (degree) that you might want to have. That is great if your trying to avoid a glare on the screen, for instance. ANSWERNOTFOUND",given this case 3 stars for some of the cons,"(17, 61)",1,0.0,False

If Netgear doesn't fix the situation, I'm upgrading to the Western Digital router which seems pretty awesome (they were at NYCC and the sales pitch was pretty good).  If you don't have any Apple devices (or are using an older iOS), then this is a good choice for you.  Just remembered, I sometimes use the wireless connection on my Mac mini and that worked fine as well.  So let me actually amend my statement to say this is great if you don't have any iOS 6 devices.

I, so far, have been proven wrong about that. The picture is excellent any way you look at it.Now, I'm not a big gamer. I'm too old for that (although I do own both an Xbox with Kinect and a Wii). So I can't verify the issues other reviewers stated about the slower refresh rate causing their video to lag while playing. As of yet, I saw no lag in anything I viewed to date. I truly believe that unless you are going to be one of those ultimately picky people that I have come across in other reviews, whether you choose to purchase this TV with the 120 hz rate of the 240, I feel you will enjoy the picture either way.One comparison I have between my Samsung 47"" and the LG 55"" is that it seems with all the reviews of these TV's, people are complaining about the light LED bleeding especially from the corners. I saw that very sugnificantly with the Samsung. But, I have to say with my experience of owning this TV in the last week, there is no such bleeding to speak of. The upper left corner seems to display a slightly lighter glow than the other three but nothing to really be annoyed about. After watching the movie ""Cowboys + Aliens"" last night, I was awe struck by the clarity of the picture and the true to life colors. No, it wasn't a blu ray copy, just the standard DVD copy and it was still awesome. I felt as if I could walk right into the screen and be part of the movie. With my theatre sound and that picture, I felt as if I was back at the theatre watching it for a second time. Oh, and it was also not in 3D mode either.I am not sure I am all that big on the local dimming option either because I was a little annoyed that when the scene went dark, and I had the room dark with just the christmas tree lights on, the picture would darken. Then when some sort of lighting would appear on screen, the picture would lighten back up to normal. I thought this was odd as to me, shouldn't the picture, in a brighter setting then become dim instead of brighter? I don't know maybe I was seeing it incorrectly, not sure.As other reviewers have commented about the 3D for this television, in a way I do find it kind of gimmicky, (if that is a word). But, that too, is still a very awesome feature for home theatre. By gimmicky, I found that while using the 3D mode during regular television viewing, if the frame of actors was still with not much movement, then the picture appeared 2D. But once the scene got more active and there was more background motion, then one can very much so see the depth of 3D. I also noticed that when viewing a program in true HD, if in 3D mode, the sharper the picture, the more the 3D depth stands out. Now, movies and videos that are shot in 3D are awesome! I have TRON Legacy in 3D. With the purchase of this TV I also purchased an LG 3D blu ray player. It was so awesome being able to view that movie feeling as if I was at the theatre watching it for the second time in 3D. It is so cool also, with the passive 3D, one can view movies and shows in 3D without worrying about a second box or if the batteries are going to die. You just put the glasses on when switched to 3D mode and totally enjoy!The LG apps are ok. There could be more. One reviewer totally put down the Netflix app. I found nothing wrong with it. It loaded my shows just fine and I actually watched and episode of ""The Munsters"" in 3D. Very cool. I dowloaded the 3D Zone app. It's a cool app if you want something to give you the feel of what your 3D watching experience should be like. The videos are streamed over the internet connection and since my wireless seems a bit hoaky at times where it is located, I had to wait for each 30 second set of video to keep downloading. I also didn't like the way the producers of these 3D vidoes felt it necessary to combine the logos for the videos with actual moving background videos. The whole experience was very annoying for me to watch with all that misplaced movement going on. Once you get passed the logos and the actual video begins to play, then it's pretty cool to watch in 3D.My whole experience with the product at this point is in one word ""Awesome""! Unless some failure happens with it or I notice other anomolies, I would definitely recommend this product to others. It's a very fun and enjoyable home theatre experience. Reviewers are mentioning how the TV cuts the resolution in half for each eye so you still get the 1080P HD picture. Well all that is way too techincal for this reviewer to worry about. All I know, from my experience the last few days, this product, whether in 3D or not, gives a very sharp, clear, wathable picture. It has a whole suite of picture setting options, some even I don't understand what they do.Oh, and I also find the magic remote quite useful. I prefer using it with the pointer on the screen as a ""one click and point"" button solution over trying to go through the menu options and trying to find all the right keys on the regular remote, especially if you can't see them in the dark. It's so much easier to use than the standard remote control. So, for me, the magic remote is a huge plus!The only drawback I found annoying, as others have mentioned, the speakers for these thin tv's have a bit to be desired. But what can one expect. I felt that once you adjust all the sound options, you can get some pretty good sound out of the built in speakers so again that function isn't even too bad. But, I want to be able to add my first sub-woofer for added bass during regular TV viewing, without having to run it through the stereo reciever where a second sub-woofer is already connected. The only option I could find on the back for an external audio out connection was the headphone jack. I tried plugging my sub-woofer into that jack but because it is labeled as a headphone jack, the tv ""smartly"" disables the on-board speakers and doesn't offer the user the option to do so his or herself. The TV warns you that you have plugged something into the headphone jack and the the speakers turn off. Then I can get some bass through my sub-woofer but now without any sound from the TV. Hmmmmm.... The Samsung at least had not a headphone jack but a labeled audio out jack and didn't disable the internal speakers unless you opted to do so through the options screen. So, now I have to research another way to get sound to my first sub-woofer without the need to turn go through my stereo receiver first.I also noticed people were complaining about the digital fibre optic output and that it didn't pass through the 5.1 audio. I haven't hooked anything up to that yet so I am not going to review or comment further unless I do.All In all, I think the TV so far is awesome and I do say go out and order it or buy it if you have the cash!!!!Update, 1.5 months after purchase....I still go with all the above except now I have tried the 5.1 optical output. I tried playing some dvd video files with 5.1 surroumd sound still encoded and the sound was produced just as it was with the original movies through all 5 speakers. I found that to be awesome!I also don't see where people FREAK out about the saying the resolution is being cut in half when viewing 3D. What exactly do you people feel your eyes are actually capable of detecting when watching television? Geez!! I felt when veiwing 3D, the picture looks every bit as sharp and clear as it did when viewing 2D. Maybe I'm not as picky as some of you but when you expect something more than your own eyes are able to detect in the first place, that is going too far in my book! Just watch it and enjoy!I personally love this television and I personally NOT going to wait a year for some other technology to come out. As far as I am concerned, the next technology will have to be when they make the images holographic and appear in the middle of my living room or viewing area without using any glasses or wearing anything extra for veiwing what-so-ever. Until they master that feet, I'm pretty satisfied with what I have now.

Well, the stand functionality leaves a little to be desired. First of all, the plastic slot in back where the leather flap is meant to insert (to create the stand) is very inflexible.

I have not seen any blemishes on the case, but I imagine that over time the flap might warp a bit, and/or if the leather smooths it might pop out of the slot. Also, trying to stand up such a small tablet (7-inch) is a bit wobbly in this case, but that is mostly due to the nature of the folds being so close together and the leather still being fairly rigid.Overall, though, a great case for the price. I like the stylish white stitching, and the case is well-built.

They are especially good at producing natural-sounding deep bass, and the overall octave-to-octave balance is excellent.

The pads that come on the MDRV6 have a non-breathable cover, and significant additional discomfort is caused by the way that the thin foam cover is glued to the pad around the inner circumference of the pad, which prevents the top and back of your ear from slipping into the space between the pad and the face of the headphone.  This forces the pad to rest on the back of the ear, which compresses the ear and eventually becomes uncomfortable.  I read on a web forum where several people had replaced the pads (which eventually come apart) with a velour pad made by BeyerDynamic, and after I did this replacement on my one pair that had a damaged pad, the increase in comfort was so great that I immediately did the other pair.  The thin cover can be glued down to the headphone face if needed to hold it in place, which then allows the top and rear of your ear to naturally  slide under the inner circumference of the pad, which is considerably more comfortable.  I can recommend this trivial modification without reservation to anyone who owns these headphones.

This is true--- there is a lack of contrast, not necessarily sharpness (at least in my copy of the lens) that you will notice.  Since I know that as a fact going in to a shoot or session, I set my aperture at F2.0, or F2.2 on my D700, or D300.  This solves the problem.  The resulting images at F 2.0 and above are amazingly sharp, and clear.  Don't get me wrong, I love my 16-35F4VR, and my 24-70F2.8 but this 50mm rocks as a standalone lens when the situation demands fast lens.

The D700 (for better high ISO performance than the D300), and my 50mm 1.8.For the price (which seems to have risen lately and rightly so) you can't go wrong.  Even if you have other zoom lenses that cover this range as I do, this lens is unbelievably useful in low light to no light situations.  Personally, I'm lazy and hate zooming with my feet, but I'd much rather do that with this lens, than either using flash, or blurring photos of important events.The lens finish is plasticy but so what?  Are you going to be banging it around on a regular basis?  My 50mm travels with me just about everywhere either in a camera bag, or in my North Face Recon backpack (not a camera backpack) just about everywhere, and I pump about 80,000 images a year per body, between landscapes, motorsports, portraits, etc.  So far, so good.  It does stand up to a beating.  I do not use any protective filter on it as the glass is relatively well recessed on this lens.When I do need to use filters such as polarizers, or ND's, I have step-up rings that take the lens from the 52mm size to 77mm which is the standard size of all my filters. It does look ""strange"" having the tiny little 50mm lens hidden behind a huge 77mm filter, but it WORKS.Again, if you are looking to make an investment -- there's that ugly word again, make that acquisition, to your photo gear you can't go wrong at this price point; If you wind up hating it, there's always the ability to return it, or sell it on eBay.Enjoy.

I originally intended it to be used for my husband's netbook; however, after it came I liked it so much that I bought another one for my Kindle, even though the Kindle is so much smaller. The reason I did this is because the case is really sturdy, very well-constructed, and convenient. The padding in it is outstanding without being bulky. Despite not having hard sides, this case has great protection (via the padding and design) for my Kindle; in the additional section I can also carry my chargers, my fountain pens, and my journal. My husband is thrilled to use it for his netbook (which is a special proprietary one for electronic medical records) and its accessories. It serves both of our needs really well.The case has two parts, one to hold the netbook or other rectangular flat electronic device, and another part with pockets to hold bulky chargers, writing implements, and other items. The way this latter part is constructed, it bulges away from the netbook part so that it will not impinge upon the netbook (this is really nice). On the outside of the case (you can see it in the picture) there is yet another pocket that opens on the front of the case with a vertical zipper. It is very well-designed. It has short handles for regular carrying and a detachable shoulder strap.

The reason I did this is because the case is really sturdy, very well-constructed, and convenient. The padding in it is outstanding without being bulky. Despite not having hard sides, this case has great protection (via the padding and design) for my Kindle; in the additional section I can also carry my chargers, my fountain pens, and my journal. My husband is thrilled to use it for his netbook (which is a special proprietary one for electronic medical records) and its accessories. It serves both of our needs really well.The case has two parts, one to hold the netbook or other rectangular flat electronic device, and another part with pockets to hold bulky chargers, writing implements, and other items. The way this latter part is constructed, it bulges away from the netbook part so that it will not impinge upon the netbook (this is really nice). On the outside of the case (you can see it in the picture) there is yet another pocket that opens on the front of the case with a vertical zipper. It is very well-designed. It has short handles for regular carrying and a detachable shoulder strap. It's very lightweight as well.This is a fine looking, very convenient, quality case.Highly recommended.***** ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1466, 1480)",5,0.0,False

The only issue I had was that it did not hold the tripod in position, it seemed to slip out more to one side or the other while walking at extended distances. To be fair I might have just not had it strapped in tight enough.Overall a great case for ANY SLR camera, I have since switched from Canon to Nikon and as you would expect the case works great.

I can fit my kindle fire hd with the case inside my inner jacket pocket while I know that I can't do that with the rest of these larger cases. Does it have the best stand? No. I would think that a stand that clicks into place would be better but this case does have rubber grips and it has never failed me. Some people may want to use the stand and push on the screen with their finger or stylus and it could be an issue there but I even use my stylus with the stand and it held up.

I originally was going to get the 24-70mm f/2.8 lens, but someone in one of the forums suggest I look at this one.  Though I lost a stop of light, I was very much sold on the IS idea (hands shake) and the cost difference between the two allowed me to invest in the Canon 430 EX II flash, which was something else I really needed to invest in, so I decided the trade-off was worth it for my purposes.I've been using the lens now for about a week, experimenting with the IS, the focus, depth of field, etc.  I wanted to be pretty sure I knew what it could do before I wrote a review.Focus and focal range:  my camera focuses very quickly with this lens, and the full-time manual focus is great for those moments when the camera ""guesses wrong"" and focuses on, say, the post beside the bird instead of the bird itself.  I was pleased that 24-105 is workable as an indoor lens on a crop sensor camera.  I didn't run into any ""have to back up to get that picture"" moments so far.  It definitely isn't an ultra-wide lens on a crop sensor body, but can be used comfortably every day.  The zoom works well for the across the room zooms when you're trying to just get the subject's face in the camera, making this a great choice as a walk-around lens for most people photography.Sharpness:  I bought this at the same time as the 70-200mm f/2.8L IS USM lens, so I have a much sharper lens (the 70-200mm f/2.8L IS II is a definite ""wow"" lens) to compare it to, so I will say this lens is acceptably, moderately sharp without a lot of post-processing.  Not as sharp as the 70-200mm f/2.8L lens (it also costs half as much), but sharper than the kit lens and the 55-250mm lens that I had with my T1i, requiring less post-processing to get a sharp image.

I originally was going to get the 24-70mm f/2.8 lens, but someone in one of the forums suggest I look at this one.  Though I lost a stop of light, I was very much sold on the IS idea (hands shake) and the cost difference between the two allowed me to invest in the Canon 430 EX II flash, which was something else I really needed to invest in, so I decided the trade-off was worth it for my purposes.I've been using the lens now for about a week, experimenting with the IS, the focus, depth of field, etc.  I wanted to be pretty sure I knew what it could do before I wrote a review.Focus and focal range:  my camera focuses very quickly with this lens, and the full-time manual focus is great for those moments when the camera ""guesses wrong"" and focuses on, say, the post beside the bird instead of the bird itself.  I was pleased that 24-105 is workable as an indoor lens on a crop sensor camera.  I didn't run into any ""have to back up to get that picture"" moments so far.  It definitely isn't an ultra-wide lens on a crop sensor body, but can be used comfortably every day.  The zoom works well for the across the room zooms when you're trying to just get the subject's face in the camera, making this a great choice as a walk-around lens for most people photography.Sharpness:  I bought this at the same time as the 70-200mm f/2.8L IS USM lens, so I have a much sharper lens (the 70-200mm f/2.8L IS II is a definite ""wow"" lens) to compare it to, so I will say this lens is acceptably, moderately sharp without a lot of post-processing.  Not as sharp as the 70-200mm f/2.8L lens (it also costs half as much), but sharper than the kit lens and the 55-250mm lens that I had with my T1i, requiring less post-processing to get a sharp image.

If all you've ever used are f3.5-fwhatever zoom lenses, you're in for a real treat with this lens.

It's simple, it's basic, and it's a joy to use.And that's the simple elegance to using a prime lens.Lenses like this and the 50mm f1.8 are small and light.  They barely add anything to the weight and bulk of just the camera body itself, especially if it's a higher-level Nikkor DSLR (D90, D300s).  It's just effortless.  Compared to some of the heavier zooms (16-85, 18-105, 18-200), it'll make your camera feel weightless.  Fantastic for all-day wandering-around photography, assuming you don't need serious wide-angle or serious telephoto.However, this lens is a 'gateway drug'.  It and the 50mm f1.8 both fall into this category.  The low price and amazing IQ hooks you.  ;-)  Use it for a while, and you'll begin to want *all* of your glass to be fast f2.8 (or better), rather than the slow 'consumer' level variable aperture lenses.

It holds the laptop at a convenient angle and makes it all the easier to use the keypad or touchpad.  Cooling efficiency is excellent with the two fans - our Lenovo and HP laptops can get a bit warm on the bottom but I found that they stay absolutely cool when on the stand.The fans are powered from a dual USB plug that lets you piggy-back any other device on it so you don't lose a USB port when the fans are plugged in.

On sale, it was the same price as the Nostromo and I am a huge Razer fan and can't live without my Naga and Vespula. That said, I have always only used Logitech keyboards and headsets and I love them just as much. This truly was a difficult decision for me and I pored over the reviews of both for days.I'm so happy with the choice I made. I can't speak to the Nostromo as I haven't used one, but I can't imagine life being any better than it is with my G13 right now. Let me say straight out, this is not as valuable for non-MMO type games which require a ridiculous number of hotkeys to perform at your best. Games like Skyrim where you're basically just moving around with WASD and attacking with two buttons will not see the huge improvements that your MMOs will experience, but it's still a very nice upgrade in terms of comfort, especially for laptop users. The G13 will serve you well in any game that requires the keyboard because it allows your wrist and arm to be in a more natural position. I can completely relax my arm rather than have to try to hover over the keyboard for long gaming sessions. I have found that the G13 works amazingly well even when not on a flat surface. I regularly play in bed on my laptop and I usually rest the base of the G13 against my thigh so that it's at an angle to the bed (if that makes sense!) and this is surprisingly awesome. I have no loss in control over playing on a flat surface and my arm can be completely relaxed at my side the entire time. It's easily tied for the best accessory you can buy for your gaming laptop, equaled only byRazer Naga MMOG Laser Gaming Mouse. Paired with aRazer Vespula Dual-Sided Gaming Mouse Matyou will only have to touch your keyboard if you use text to chat. If you use voice chat over Ventrilo or Teamspeak, your keyboard will be collecting dust from lack of use. What I love about this setup is the ability to have both of my hands at my sides when I'm using my gaming laptop and I'm supremely comfortable. Mobile gaming is the future and I want to be able to take my games with me and be comfortable wherever I play while still being as effective as possible. The G13 is a huge part of what makes this possible.Now don't get me wrong, I also love my G13 with my desktop PC. The profiles are stored on the gameboard so I can easily move it from computer to computer with no issue. It works great on a desk being nicely weighted and with a good grip on the base. It doesn't slip or give without excessive force (and no one games THAT hard!). The design is also perfect. I was truly concerned because I have smaller hands and that is actually a big factor behind this purchase. With smaller hands, it's hard to reach across a keyboard to hit all those hotkeys. I read a lot of reviews claiming the G13 is not kind to small hands but I have not found that to be the case. With my palm resting comfortably on the designated rest, I can easily reach the top row of keys. The furthest on the left and right are a bit of a stretch for constant use but I find G1 in the upper left is perfect for TAB and targeting mobs. The one just below is nice for SPACE or jump. I use the top five center keys for 1-5 and the five directly below for 6-10. I have no trouble accessing any of them at any time and I adjusted to the new positions really quickly, faster than I learned to use my Razer Naga by far. I mapped the keys near the joystick to M and L for map and quest log. And of course, the joystick has completely replaced my WASD keys for movement. Moving with a joystick is so natural, especially for console gamers, even casual ones like myself. I have none of the issues others have mentioned about it hurting their thumbs or being hard to push. A very gentle push is all that's needed to continuously move forward. Diagonals are possible also. I tend to hold forward on the joystick and mouse steer because that's what I'm used to, but I find myself turning with the joystick more and more and it works great. Now my fingers are completely free to access my primary hotkeys rather than trying to contort my hand to reach WASD keys and hotkeys simultaneously. I have my secondary hotkeys assigned to my Razer Naga and I'm good to go with split second response time thanks to all keys being within my natural reach without straining.The best tip I can give new users who are having trouble accessing keys is to remap them manually for each game that you play. It really only takes a few minutes to do and once it's done, you don't have to worry about it again. By default, WoW's map is set up so that the center keys on the gameboard are assigned to WASD. This made no sense to me because I wanted to get away from using my fingers for movement and do it all with my thumb on the joystick. The key profiling software is very user friendly and easy to understand without ever looking at the manual. You just click the G key you want to change in the interface, and then press the key you want it to be. Easy. I remapped all my keys so that they would work for ME. I appreciate all the effort Logitech put into pre-designing key layouts for so many games, but ultimately what's going to work best for you is a layout you choose yourself. Pick keys that are easy to reach (which should be most of them, even for small hands) for your primary abilities and use the ones that are a bit of a stretch (if any) to lesser used functions, like map, bag and quest log. I've seen so many reviews where people complain that the keys aren't in the right place. Change them!My only regret is that I didn't buy one sooner. The G13 has changed my gaming for the better, and with kids, school and work, I want the most out of my game time, and now I have it. Thank you once again, Logitech!

You may need to move up or down the road to find your address, when you do, save as your favorite.  This Garmin is new to me so this was unexpected as the screen shows nothing but a main road when the map is first accessed in rurual areas.  Keep in mind that if the road is not on the screen, tap the plus to get closer and it will appear.  Then tap for the address locations. I was really glad this function is available.

Keep in mind, I came straight over from primarily using HDDs for my mass storage devices, thus the difference to me was more noticeable than for someone moving between SSDs (depending on their quality, of course.) For those who are more technically inclined or interested, I will paste benchmark data for the drive's performance at the end of the review.The design of the drive is very sleek and stylish. It boasts a smooth, polished, black exterior to house the powerful internals. You see what you expect out of an SSD: a lot of performance using a very small amount of space. I was a little bummed when I had to install it out of view as it was quite pleasant to look at.Installation is simple just like any other SATA drive; plug it into your motherboard and power supply, and you'll be smooth sailing from there.I'll discuss performance in terms of what's visibly noticeable, and following the conclusion, as aforementioned I will post benchmark results.

After I log in, I am instantly able to begin opening programs, and they load quickly. Anything from Firefox or Chrome, my large Steam library, or large movie files. I have not attempted to utilize any hungry video/photo editing programs, but you can rest assured that your loading times with those would be low as well. Furthermore, I play very high performing games such as Skyrim with high-res texture mods, Battlefield 3, and Anno 2070 to name a few.When considering this SSD for purchase, keep in mind the cost per GB when thinking about what size of SSD to get. Of course, if you just want to boot your OS quickly and some important high performance programs, you are likely better off with a smaller SSD with a larger HDD to store other files. In my case, I've installed the OS, all of my programs, and games to the SSD, while having a couple of other much larger HDDs to store the large movie files, music libraries, etc. Keep in mind, I don't install all of my games simultaneously to allow more room for other purposes.

That would be the quality and flexibility of the video, the quality of the optical image stabilization, and the overall quality of the still pictures it takes.  I didn't care about the GPS as it is largely a gimmick in my opinion and all the major competitors have it now or they feel they won't be able to compete.You should realize that the GPS built into this camera (and most cameras) is NOT the same GPS you may be used to in your car or smart phone.  It does not have detailed maps, does not have a large database of places or landmarks, and is not as accurate.  It is basically for tagging your photos and videos with the latitude and longitude of where you took the image so you don't have to take notes manually to sort out what you shot and where later.  That's why I consider it largely a gimmick.Briefly then, this camera had by far, the best video quality and flexibility.  You can select AVCHD video in several quality levels including full HD at 1920 x 1080 @ 60 fps (if your computer can handle it--many can't), MP4 video in several quality settings including full HD 1920 x 1080 @ 30 fps, and even a (not too useful) 320 x 240 setting for high-speed video at 240 fps.FOR TECHIES ONLY: Note that most of these video settings output progressive video but one of them outputs interlaced (can't remember which AVCHD setting).  This makes me suspicious that the internal video circuitry may be interlaced and not progressive and they simply convert (deinterlace) the video when they create the progressive video file on the memory card.  I could not find confirmation on this anywhere and calling Panasonic support is utterly useless for something this technical--they just aren't trained to know such things.  I must say though that I didn't notice any interlaced artifacts or sharpness/quality issues with the video so I'm satisfied with the video either way.The optical image stabilization is absolutely amazing and was so far superior to the Nikon for example, that I had to keep checking that I actually had the image stabilization in the Nikon turned on!  You can literally hand-hold the camera at full 20x zoom (being very deliberate and careful) and shoot acceptable video, which is almost unheard of in a small camera like this.The still images are very high quality and have relatively low noise for a camera that has this many pixels in the sensor.  Most consumers don't realize that it's mostly the marketing departments that want to keep pushing the number of pixels in these small cameras.  The engineers know that when you put this many pixels on a small sensor, you get more noise artifacts and you can do only so much about that.  This camera is no different in that regard than all the others that are 14 or higher megapixels, regardless of what they claim in their marketing hype.And the final selling point over some of the competitors for me was that this camera, even with all its consumer ""presets"" to make this a ""point-and-shoot"" camera (actually almost too many--confusing!) still has FULL MANUAL CONTROLS and aperture or shutter priority settings for ""real"" photographers.Note that like most other pocket cameras, this one does not support RAW files but that's not what it is intended for.  Furthermore, with single images files as large as almost 13 MB in size from the 14.1 megapixel sensor, you have more than enough pixels to do some serious Photoshop work even without having RAW files to work with.This will now be my ""take everywhere"" camera when I don't need to do ""serious"" photography and don't want to lug around my full sized Canon DSLR and lenses.

You can select AVCHD video in several quality levels including full HD at 1920 x 1080 @ 60 fps (if your computer can handle it--many can't), MP4 video in several quality settings including full HD 1920 x 1080 @ 30 fps, and even a (not too useful) 320 x 240 setting for high-speed video at 240 fps.FOR TECHIES ONLY: Note that most of these video settings output progressive video but one of them outputs interlaced (can't remember which AVCHD setting).  This makes me suspicious that the internal video circuitry may be interlaced and not progressive and they simply convert (deinterlace) the video when they create the progressive video file on the memory card.  I could not find confirmation on this anywhere and calling Panasonic support is utterly useless for something this technical--they just aren't trained to know such things.  I must say though that I didn't notice any interlaced artifacts or sharpness/quality issues with the video so I'm satisfied with the video either way.The optical image stabilization is absolutely amazing and was so far superior to the Nikon for example, that I had to keep checking that I actually had the image stabilization in the Nikon turned on!  You can literally hand-hold the camera at full 20x zoom (being very deliberate and careful) and shoot acceptable video, which is almost unheard of in a small camera like this.The still images are very high quality and have relatively low noise for a camera that has this many pixels in the sensor.  Most consumers don't realize that it's mostly the marketing departments that want to keep pushing the number of pixels in these small cameras.  The engineers know that when you put this many pixels on a small sensor, you get more noise artifacts and you can do only so much about that.  This camera is no different in that regard than all the others that are 14 or higher megapixels, regardless of what they claim in their marketing hype.And the final selling point over some of the competitors for me was that this camera, even with all its consumer ""presets"" to make this a ""point-and-shoot"" camera (actually almost too many--confusing!) still has FULL MANUAL CONTROLS and aperture or shutter priority settings for ""real"" photographers.Note that like most other pocket cameras, this one does not support RAW files but that's not what it is intended for.  Furthermore, with single images files as large as almost 13 MB in size from the 14.1 megapixel sensor, you have more than enough pixels to do some serious Photoshop work even without having RAW files to work with.This will now be my ""take everywhere"" camera when I don't need to do ""serious"" photography and don't want to lug around my full sized Canon DSLR and lenses.

One was the main router and the other was an access point connected to the first via Ethernet cable. In the past few months, one of them started acting up and I decided this was a good time to upgrade. After reading lots of reviews, this was the router I chose and I bought two of them.The entire experience couldn't have gone smoother. After turning off my old routers, I opened one of these and set it up to be the main router. The order of turning things on in the manual didn't work out for me, so I just unplugged everything and started them in order from the cable: cable modem, router, then computer. Doing that, everything talked fine. I ran the quick setup, then went back to change the settings to the choices I wanted. I upgraded the firmware, set an SSID for each band, turned on WPA-Personal and set keys, played with a few other settings (setting IP and hard-coded DNS servers) and restarted everything again with all of my wired Ethernet devices plugged in. I left choices that I used to make manually, like channels, to auto. It worked perfectly right off the bat.Then I set up the second router as an access point. This router has a particularly nice feature in that you can just tell it that you want it to be an access point, rather than a full router, and it makes all the changes to the settings for you. If that's not enough, when in the access point mode, the WAN port becomes a LAN port so you don't have to waste one of your four wired ports on connecting the two routers together. Very nice! I turned off all the various server functions, gave it an IP, set it up with the same SSIDs and keys, took it upstairs, plugged in the wired peripherals and turned it on. Like the first one, it just worked.It's just been one day, so I can't speak to things like longevity, but the set up was easy and the routers seem really solid. As expected, the 2.4GHz band gives me greater range, but that range is greater than what I used to get with my old Linksys. The 5.0GHz band has about the same range as my old Linksys... perhaps a tad smaller. As it turns out, while I did have some speed problems on the old setup, both bands here give me fast, reliable connections, so I really don't see much effective difference between connecting to the 2.4GHz and 5.0GHz bands in practice. Since I run my streaming video via wired Ethernet, I guess that makes sense. I probably didn't need a dual-band router, in hindsight, but I'm happy with this.Also, the combination of this change, and a new cable modem, have resulted in about a 20% increase in my Internet speed. I can't say which component(s) are responsible, but I'm happy with the result. In the end, I can't imagine anyone asking for more in terms of ease of setup or short-term performance than this router. I recommend it.**UPDATE**January 2 2012I bought these back in August and by mid-December, I started having problems with connectivity to the Internet. Some things would work (like web browsing) and others wouldn't (like checking email). If I left it alone, eventually, it wouldn't pass along any traffic at all. Whenever it happened, a quick unplug and re-plug would solve the problem. I won't go into all the details of the troubleshooting, but it turns out that both units I bought have gone bad. I have shipped one back to ASUS for replacement and am limping along with just the one (and having to restart it all the time). When that one is replaced, then I'll send the second one back. I really like the features on these routers, but I can no longer recommend them. When two out of two have failed, then it's hard to think that it's just one of those things. I have lowered by rating from 5-stars to 3.January 23 2012The stars just keep falling on this for me. I still haven't received the one back that I sent for replacement/repair even though their web site status says it was repaired weeks ago. (They received it Jan 5.) They just won't bother shipping it back to me. In the meantime, the other one finally became unusable, so my investment in two of these relatively expensive routers has ended up for nothing. I just ordered an RMA number for the second one. Since it's not working, I may as well see if they'll actually fix it and return it. We'll see. To ASUS's credit, their tech support people are friendly and helpful and one guy did offer today to see if he can get the repair people to ship mine out. I can't live without Internet access, so I ended up buying a factory refurbished Linksys E2500 for about one-third of the price of these. It's running brilliantly and now I'm not even sure I want these ASUS routers back in service once they're fixed. I'm seriously considering buying a second Linksys and selling these when they come back. I've reduced my rating to 2-stars. What's the point of buying high-end products if they keep failing?February 16, 2012The first router is finally on its way back to me. They promise 10 day service, but by the time I get it back, it will have been 42 days. In the meantime, I bought a second refurbished Linksys E2500, and I am not putting the ASUS ones back in service when they do get back. The Linksys routers work much better, have stronger signals and (most importantly) are working reliably. My Netflix used to pause and stop to re-buffer all the time. I never knew if that was about the routers, the cable modem or the Internet service itself, but that hasn't happened once since putting the new routers in place. Yeah, the last star is falling away. I'm getting better service from routers that cost one-third of what these do, so I'll be selling these when they get back.December 3, 2012I've been using the Linksys routers as described above and had left my two Asus routers, returned from repair, in their boxes. I had intended to sell them, but never got around to it. Recently, I decided to set up a media server and thought that gigabit wired Ethernet would be a good idea (the E2500s are 10/100 routers). Cable Internet doesn't come into the house fast enough for that to matter, but moving HD video around the house might. I figured, since I have these two repaired Asus routers sitting here, I'd go ahead and swap out the Linksys ones for them. The Asus ones do have a lot more features. So I upgraded to the latest firmware (3.0.0.4.260), set them up from scratch and put them to work. The good news is that the new firmware does support IPv6 and it works fine. The bad news is, they only lasted two days before acting up again. After working Saturday night and Sunday, I sat down with my iPad tonight and, despite a 4-bar signal, it wouldn't open a web page reliably. I switched it from the 2.4 GHz to the 5 GHz network, and it worked again for a while, then stopped working again. Then I tried to play a show on Netflix from my Apple TV (wired, not wireless) and for the first time since my last update, the show kept stopping to reload the buffer. I swapped the two Linksys routers back into the network and all problems cleared up instantly. Apparently these work for some people, but even after repair and an update to the latest firmware, I am having no luck. Now I'm reluctant to sell them, since they don't really work, so I guess I'll finally write off this loss and give up on Asus altogether. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(7366, 7380)",2,0.0,False

If that's not enough, when in the access point mode, the WAN port becomes a LAN port so you don't have to waste one of your four wired ports on connecting the two routers together. Very nice! I turned off all the various server functions, gave it an IP, set it up with the same SSIDs and keys, took it upstairs, plugged in the wired peripherals and turned it on. Like the first one, it just worked.It's just been one day, so I can't speak to things like longevity, but the set up was easy and the routers seem really solid. As expected, the 2.4GHz band gives me greater range, but that range is greater than what I used to get with my old Linksys. The 5.0GHz band has about the same range as my old Linksys... perhaps a tad smaller. As it turns out, while I did have some speed problems on the old setup, both bands here give me fast, reliable connections, so I really don't see much effective difference between connecting to the 2.4GHz and 5.0GHz bands in practice. Since I run my streaming video via wired Ethernet, I guess that makes sense. I probably didn't need a dual-band router, in hindsight, but I'm happy with this.Also, the combination of this change, and a new cable modem, have resulted in about a 20% increase in my Internet speed. I can't say which component(s) are responsible, but I'm happy with the result. In the end, I can't imagine anyone asking for more in terms of ease of setup or short-term performance than this router. I recommend it.**UPDATE**January 2 2012I bought these back in August and by mid-December, I started having problems with connectivity to the Internet. Some things would work (like web browsing) and others wouldn't (like checking email). If I left it alone, eventually, it wouldn't pass along any traffic at all. Whenever it happened, a quick unplug and re-plug would solve the problem. I won't go into all the details of the troubleshooting, but it turns out that both units I bought have gone bad. I have shipped one back to ASUS for replacement and am limping along with just the one (and having to restart it all the time). When that one is replaced, then I'll send the second one back. I really like the features on these routers, but I can no longer recommend them. When two out of two have failed, then it's hard to think that it's just one of those things. I have lowered by rating from 5-stars to 3.January 23 2012The stars just keep falling on this for me. I still haven't received the one back that I sent for replacement/repair even though their web site status says it was repaired weeks ago. (They received it Jan 5.) They just won't bother shipping it back to me. In the meantime, the other one finally became unusable, so my investment in two of these relatively expensive routers has ended up for nothing. I just ordered an RMA number for the second one. Since it's not working, I may as well see if they'll actually fix it and return it. We'll see. To ASUS's credit, their tech support people are friendly and helpful and one guy did offer today to see if he can get the repair people to ship mine out. I can't live without Internet access, so I ended up buying a factory refurbished Linksys E2500 for about one-third of the price of these. It's running brilliantly and now I'm not even sure I want these ASUS routers back in service once they're fixed. I'm seriously considering buying a second Linksys and selling these when they come back. I've reduced my rating to 2-stars. What's the point of buying high-end products if they keep failing?February 16, 2012The first router is finally on its way back to me. They promise 10 day service, but by the time I get it back, it will have been 42 days. In the meantime, I bought a second refurbished Linksys E2500, and I am not putting the ASUS ones back in service when they do get back. The Linksys routers work much better, have stronger signals and (most importantly) are working reliably. My Netflix used to pause and stop to re-buffer all the time. I never knew if that was about the routers, the cable modem or the Internet service itself, but that hasn't happened once since putting the new routers in place. Yeah, the last star is falling away. I'm getting better service from routers that cost one-third of what these do, so I'll be selling these when they get back.December 3, 2012I've been using the Linksys routers as described above and had left my two Asus routers, returned from repair, in their boxes. I had intended to sell them, but never got around to it. Recently, I decided to set up a media server and thought that gigabit wired Ethernet would be a good idea (the E2500s are 10/100 routers). Cable Internet doesn't come into the house fast enough for that to matter, but moving HD video around the house might. I figured, since I have these two repaired Asus routers sitting here, I'd go ahead and swap out the Linksys ones for them. The Asus ones do have a lot more features. So I upgraded to the latest firmware (3.0.0.4.260), set them up from scratch and put them to work. The good news is that the new firmware does support IPv6 and it works fine. The bad news is, they only lasted two days before acting up again. After working Saturday night and Sunday, I sat down with my iPad tonight and, despite a 4-bar signal, it wouldn't open a web page reliably. I switched it from the 2.4 GHz to the 5 GHz network, and it worked again for a while, then stopped working again. Then I tried to play a show on Netflix from my Apple TV (wired, not wireless) and for the first time since my last update, the show kept stopping to reload the buffer. I swapped the two Linksys routers back into the network and all problems cleared up instantly. Apparently these work for some people, but even after repair and an update to the latest firmware, I am having no luck. Now I'm reluctant to sell them, since they don't really work, so I guess I'll finally write off this loss and give up on Asus altogether.

Needless to say last night I learned that porn is stronger than the Nighthawk.Parental Control Problems:1. If you set the router on the highest setting for network protection it filters porn, however it also filters out pretty much anything but first grade friendly material. A no-go for a house with a teenager who has reports to do for school and needs internet access.2. In the Parental Control interface you can setup strict browsing for the family and an override account for those who don't need or want it, but using 'custom' settings is frustrating and seems to be hit and miss for porn specifically.3. In the Parental Control settings you can add up to 25 sites you want blocked. That's it - and it's not enough for all trash on the internet!4. In the Genie dashboard under Advanced - Security you can add keywords and domains (yuck dot com, dot net...) to block. When those are set, if a user attempts to go there they get a black screen with red stripes that says 'Firewall Blocked' user.5. Removing a 'keyword' is a joke too! You have to clear the list and start over, as it won't let you delete just one word like 'porn' to eliminate all sites with that keyword in the title from opening.You can set things up so that the administrator gets emailed every time one of the blocked sites gets a 'knock, knock' by a user on your network.

It's twice as expensive as the most expensive one I've previously purchased and also twice as big.  Despite these things, I was looking for a router to replace myBelkin N750 Wireless DB Dual-Band Gigabit N+ Router With High Speed HD Streaming & USB (F9K1103), which while OK, was struggling to keep up with the growing WiFi demands of my family.With 15 wireless devices used on the network (laptops, desktops, streaming devices, smartphones, gaming systems, etc...), if everyone was connected, we all experienced signal drop offs. When streaming video it was not uncommon to get lagging connections and/or encounter buffering issues.After reading a bit about higher end routers, I decided to get a simultaneous dual band router. This one works well as you can set the (QoS - Quality of Service) to uploads (for gaming) or to downloads (for streaming).

This is a review of the 16GB Zune HD.  You will not see a comparison or mention of any Apple product here.  I am a 39 year old male and this review is for the Zune HD and what it is like to OWN one so that others may decide if they want one.  First off, you will notice that this review is ""Amazon Verified"" - yes, I purchased the Zune from Amazon and waited a couple of weeks to actually USE the product before submitting a review of it unlike some of the others here.  Enjoy....Packaging:The Zune comes in a nice small black box that slides open to reveal the contents which are the Zune HD, headphones, USB cable and some paperwork.  It's very stylish and nice.  Not much else to say as the box has been tucked away ever since opening.The look and feel:Ever since the first time I saw pictures on the net of the Zune HD I have wanted one.  Being a previous owner of a couple of different MP3 players the Zune was a must have just for the looks alone.  It really has nice lines and the color is just right; black and silver.  I hate this new term ""sexy"" and cringe when I hear a guy say it about an electronic device.  It does describe the Zune but I won't call it that.  The weight is very nice and it feels good in your hand.  I love the modern look and if they ever turned this device into a phone I would by one in a heartbeat!  I sometimes hold it to my ear and think, ""WoW what a cool phone this would be.""  The Zune logo on the back and a simple ""ZUNE"" on the front - very elegant.  On top is a power on button, the left side a volume rocker and the home button on the front.  The bottom is where you plug in your headphones and next to that is where the docking connector/USB cable plugs in.  It's the kind of device that has looks that will never get old and you want to just keep staring at it.  Very pleasing to have something you want everyone to see.The screen:OLED - it's the big talk these days.  I have a few pictures on my device right now and I have to say they look great.  The blacks are true blacks because the device shuts down the pixels where there should be black so you see true blacks and vibrant colors.  Outside I agree with most folks about the glare.  I have the brightness turned all the way up and it looks nice inside but outside the glare on the glass makes it as if you want to look at the reflection then back to what's on the screen.  I don't see this as a problem as I can't imagine any other electronic device no matter what it is not having this same problem.  For me, I can still see what is on the screen and have no problem with it.  It is just the right size at 3.3 inches.UI interface:Although inside the box there was no manual you would really have to be pretty stupid if you couldn't figure out how to navigate on this device.  Also, on the Zune web page is everything you need to know about how to work this device - who needs paper these days anyway???  The transitions from screen to screen are so fluid, smooth and animated.  The touch only needs to be light and it works flawlessly.  After using the device for a few minutes you get the idea of how to navigate.  You start off with a list of items to choose from on the main menu; pictures, music, apps, ect, etc.  As you click one you dive into that section and dive even deeper as you work what ever you have chosen clicking/touching away.  At all times the home button on the front will take you back to the main menu.  The accelerator zips from landscape to portrait very fast and smooth.  I really like that and feel the tegra chip inside is working for me without strain when I see this - video especially.  Multi touch works well and tapping is fine too especially on the web browser.  Everything is laid out nicely and there is no confusion about how to find something.  This is a plus for first timers and experienced users alike.Zune software: (APPS & Marketplace)This is a free download and helps you manage the Zune contents and updates.  The software mimics some of the icons on the Zune so you quickly identify the UI and what you need to click.  Syncing is a breeze and Zune will let you customize what content you want on the device and what you want Zune to do with it.  I have all of my MP3's in my music folder on my computer and it grabbed all of them when I plugged in for the first time with no problems.  There are some complaits about the software and how it takes forever to download - not true.  There are not a lot of apps right now.  I hope this blossoms as the months go by.  I have downloaded all of them so far as they are free but would gladly pay for any others if they should come about and would be useful.  The weather app is nice and lets you add as many cities as you want and shows you not only current conditions but a five day forecast as well.  The calculator well is a calculator.  The games have been just OK - I feel they do not utilize the Tegra chip but in the future I am sure the games will utilize the chip as it would be a waste if they didn't.  There is a chess game, Texas hold em, space ship shooter, a Bejeweled like game, soduku, and some game where you try to figure out where an item is hidden after mixing up three robots.  All are fun for a short while but I wait for more advanced cool games.  Also the games have ads just before they start - we are talking about 5 seconds of a video clip.  For a free download I think they have every right to put this here.  Also, FOUR to FIVE SECONDS is what we are talking about.  Is it that much time???  Patience!!!!  The marketplace is just something you need to experience.  Music, Videos, Podcasts and more.... EVERYTHING is here for you to choose from.  There is an option for a Zune pass and for $14.99 a month you can go nuts with this and download as much media as yo want - you get to keep 10 songs a month too.  This alone is worth buying the Zune HD.  There is so much content at the market place that I can't really explain.  Imagine walking into a store that has no one in it but you and the inventory consists of basically every kind of music you can think of as well as tons of other types of media just for you alone to walk up and down the isle to choose from.  I just hope for more apps in the future and (I know) this thing just came out so while I wait for apps I will enjoy my Zune....Docking station:I went with the basic Zune HD sync doc ($49) and lucked out with it.  There is an A/V dock you can purchase too($89).  I will tell you the only difference between the two is 1) the price and 2) the A/V doc comes with the HDMI and optical cables.  So if you already have these cables, which most of us do, save $40+ dollars and get the regular sync doc.  I have a review on the doc here on Amazon (where I purchased it) so check that out.  It is nice to just plug it in and sync and charge.  Also I can hook it up to a TV if I wanted or a receiver and utilize the Zune to transfer music and video to my home entertainment center.  The doc compliments the Zune and is very stylish looking and most importantly - Functional.Battery life:The OLED must be doing what it is supposed to do - save power.  I take the train every day to work from Milford, CT to Greenwich, CT and I can go about a week without charging using the Zune about an hour or so a day.  Wonderful! The only thing I have noticed is the back gets warm when in use.  Very strange.  I have been impressed with the battery and hope it stays that way.Screen protectors:I never had one before and at the time I received my Zune there was only Ghost Armor available.  I got one screen protector and had no problem putting it on but being a noob I didn't spray my fingers and my finger print was stuck on the adhesive side.  So I took it off.  Ghost armor was very nice and sent me a replacement but instead of just the screen protector they sent the full body armor - how nice of them!  This time around I was very careful and it went on with no problems BUT....I noticed the screen protector was about an eighth of an inch too short on top.  It was enough to bother me so I took it off.  (I know you are thinking I am nuts)  So I looked and found BodyGarudz on the net.  Not only do they sell TWO screen protectors for the price of ONE but it also fit perfectly.  I used the squeegee and applicator solution from Ghost to put the BodyGaurdz shield on - why?  Because BodyGaurdz's applicator solution wasn't as good as Ghosts and Ghost's squeegee was much better than BodyGaurdz.  So my insane suggestion - go with BodyGaurdz for the screen protector.  One other thing - the Ghost armor seems thicker - I can feel the sharp edges of the plastic now on the Zune because it has full body protection.  I hope they come out with some cool cases so I can rip this stuff off and throw more cash down the drain...!  The BodyGaurdz screen protector is thinner and looks great.Internet: (WiFi)The browser works well on the Zune HD.  I connected to my home network in seconds and at work it's even quicker.  You can tap and multi-touch to zoom in and move the pages around.  The keyboard is OK and can be used in landscape or portrait mode.  You can store pages in favorites and check AOL mail and what not.  It uses Bing to find what you are searching for.  I use it mostly for mail as at work the computers are restricted but WiFi is open.  You can sync via WiFi and download too which is very nice.Music (Sound):There is an internal equalizer with different settings depending on what type of music you are listening too.  It works OK - the music sounds fine to me.  I didn't use the supplied headphones as I have a pair of Sony Ear buds and they work better for my ears.  The music sounds great and the interface is cool - volume can be operated via the rocker on the side or touch screen.  Filtering music, making playlists and and just listening is a pleasure - this is what I got the device for - MUSIC - so everything else is just an added bonus to me.  I haven't bothered with the HD Radio much but it is cool to have. Remember...added bonus....Conclusion:I just love this Zune HD.  It really is functional for what I need it to do and the style, look and feel are just so right.  I hope this review helps you in your decision.  I will continue to update this review in the future so check back and best of luck to you and take care!

Not only do they sell TWO screen protectors for the price of ONE but it also fit perfectly.  I used the squeegee and applicator solution from Ghost to put the BodyGaurdz shield on - why?  Because BodyGaurdz's applicator solution wasn't as good as Ghosts and Ghost's squeegee was much better than BodyGaurdz.  So my insane suggestion - go with BodyGaurdz for the screen protector.  One other thing - the Ghost armor seems thicker - I can feel the sharp edges of the plastic now on the Zune because it has full body protection.  I hope they come out with some cool cases so I can rip this stuff off and throw more cash down the drain...!  The BodyGaurdz screen protector is thinner and looks great.Internet: (WiFi)The browser works well on the Zune HD.  I connected to my home network in seconds and at work it's even quicker.  You can tap and multi-touch to zoom in and move the pages around.  The keyboard is OK and can be used in landscape or portrait mode.  You can store pages in favorites and check AOL mail and what not.  It uses Bing to find what you are searching for.  I use it mostly for mail as at work the computers are restricted but WiFi is open.  You can sync via WiFi and download too which is very nice.Music (Sound):There is an internal equalizer with different settings depending on what type of music you are listening too.  It works OK - the music sounds fine to me.  I didn't use the supplied headphones as I have a pair of Sony Ear buds and they work better for my ears.  The music sounds great and the interface is cool - volume can be operated via the rocker on the side or touch screen.  Filtering music, making playlists and and just listening is a pleasure - this is what I got the device for - MUSIC - so everything else is just an added bonus to me.  I haven't bothered with the HD Radio much but it is cool to have. Remember...added bonus....Conclusion:I just love this Zune HD.  It really is functional for what I need it to do and the style, look and feel are just so right.  I hope this review helps you in your decision.  I will continue to update this review in the future so check back and best of luck to you and take care! ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(10378, 10392)",1,0.0,False

After owning and using all those, the Roku is the only one that has a place in my livingroom, and here's why...Without boring everyone on the specs of the R's, let me start by telling about my experience setting it up.Once unpacked one simply plugs the power adapter into the wall and an HDMI cable into the TV and the Roku, that's it. The unit begins booting up then asks you to select whether you want to use a wireless or wired network connection. I selected wireless and it then shows a list of the networks it detected. Once you choose your network you input the password for your network and in a few seconds it connects right away.Finally it displays an activation code which you are to use to activate and attach the Roku to your online Roku account. For some seeking out a computer that may or may not be near the TV might be a pain, but I simply opened Safari on my iPhone and added the code to my account while sitting in front of the TV.Once the code is entered, as part of the attaching process you are prompted to add payment info just in case you want to buy a channel or game in the future. You can not bypass this but IT'S OK. Enter it in and finish the account set up. Once you do you can simply choose to delete the payment info and it's erased from the Roku servers.Once the account is made and successfully linked, the Roku automatically downloads the channels from your account (if you are attaching it to an existing account) or just quickly downloads the few selected during the account creation process, including ""Angry Birds Space"".That's it, its that easy to get it set and ready to stream. Of course with some premium channels you will either need to log in to your account from the Roku (Netflix) or similarly link the box to your online account using a computer, smartphone, or tablet browser (Amazon Instant Video).I have found that the set up is incredibly easy over the numerous boxes I've used over the last few years and always recommend a Roku to especially those less adept at setting up electronics/computers/networking items.The interface--The interface of the Roku units has always been a sore point.. When it started out with just Netflix and then just a few channels, the horizontal row of channel icons was fine, but now with HUNDREDS of channels it was sorely needing a refresh. The interface alone was one of the biggest reasons I was always trying different streaming boxes..I'm so pleased to see the new grid-style interface on the R3. Not only is it beautifully rendered, but it is very, very fast to navigate and to find whatever it is you want in your channel list. Very modern-looking and functional.One huge thing I notice over the older units in the interface is that besides it being ""pretty"", even the channels load much faster than previous units thanks to a new processor.The universal search function is great too, allowing you to search for movies, shows, and even actors across the major providers.The USB port--USB functionality is a great add-on for the top tier Roku. The Roku units are first and foremost internet streamers, but the convenience of plugging in a thumb drive and being able to play some of my personal movie collection is great. Video format is rather limited, but again this is an add-on feature not a main selling point. Because I'm an iTunes user, I rip all my movies/shows as H.264 MP4 files because thy are iPhone/iPad compatible, and just so happen they are compatible with Roku as well.

That might or might not be coming so if you get one, just assume you won't have it. Cute little kitty videos are fun to watch on the TV, but there's tons more you can watch on other channels. I love the fact I can get live streaming news from the BBC or CNN International, or watch cheesy, badly dubbed Kung fu movies, or B-movie horror and sci-fi all night long for free from my Roku if I want lol. The Roku's available programming really is like a buffet, its all you can eat and there's something for everybody.The remote ---The remote is very comfortable in the hands and acts as a motion-controlled controller for gaming. It it also isn't infared like a traditional remote so that means it doesn't have to be pointed right at the TV in order to work. The private listening mode worked really nicely when I tried it and I can imagine many uses for it.Overall the Roku 3 is a great upgrade from the previous Roku 2, mostly because of the new UI (which will be coming to the roku 2 units in a month or two), the faster processor, and the wireless private listening mode. If you already have an R2 XS, I don't honestly think its worth upgrading since its biggest noticeable feature (the UI) will come in time.For some just now dipping their toes in the world of internet streaming, I personally would get this Roku 3 hands-down over any other competing player on the market. Its so easy to use and that's why not only is it what I use but what my elderly parents use too. The best thing about them is they keep getting better.

If you already have an R2 XS, I don't honestly think its worth upgrading since its biggest noticeable feature (the UI) will come in time.For some just now dipping their toes in the world of internet streaming, I personally would get this Roku 3 hands-down over any other competing player on the market. Its so easy to use and that's why not only is it what I use but what my elderly parents use too. The best thing about them is they keep getting better.

I have two other Canon IS USM lenses, a 17-55 f2.8 and a 70-300 f4-f5.6.  I bought this lens to fill the gap between the two.I haven't had this new lens very long, but here are my initial impressions...  First, it's shorter (when zoomed out), lighter and smaller in diameter than the 17-55 f2.8 lens that was previously our typical carry-around lens.  Obviously, it doesn't work as well in low light as the f2.8 lens, but that's to be expected.  Still, it takes very nice pictures, and doesn't seem too limited by the smaller aperture.  The colors seem accurate, and the IS seems to work very well.The barrel doesn't rotate, either when zooming or focusing, so it is possible to use filters that rely on a fixed orientation.  This is not the case with my 70-300mm zoom...that lens rotates as it focuses.  Though it isn't a big deal to me, others might be more concerned with this.My only complaint with this lens is that, unlike my other two Canon IS USM zoom lenses, it will extend under it's own weight when the camera is facing down.  And there is no lock (again, unlike my other two lenses) to keep it in it's shortest length during transport.  This annoys me when I'm carrying the camera.Comparing pictures taken with this lens to those taken with my 70-300 lens (at 70 and 135...the widest two lengths common to both lenses)...this lens seemed to have slightly more vivid colors, and a wider DOF.  The depth of field was to be expected, I'd think, given the shorter lens and slightly larger aperture.  The more vivid colors, I guess, could be explained the same way, though the difference was very small.  Both lenses produced very nice results, IMO.My lens was a white-box lens...which was not mentioned in the product description.  I half-expected this, given that the price I paid was low...lower even than the current prime price shown on Amazon for this item.  But I would like to have seen the item description accurately state this up front.  The lens came wrapped in a single layer of bubble-wrap inside a plain white cardboard box.

I have two other Canon IS USM lenses, a 17-55 f2.8 and a 70-300 f4-f5.6.  I bought this lens to fill the gap between the two.I haven't had this new lens very long, but here are my initial impressions...  First, it's shorter (when zoomed out), lighter and smaller in diameter than the 17-55 f2.8 lens that was previously our typical carry-around lens.  Obviously, it doesn't work as well in low light as the f2.8 lens, but that's to be expected.  Still, it takes very nice pictures, and doesn't seem too limited by the smaller aperture.  The colors seem accurate, and the IS seems to work very well.The barrel doesn't rotate, either when zooming or focusing, so it is possible to use filters that rely on a fixed orientation.  This is not the case with my 70-300mm zoom...that lens rotates as it focuses.  Though it isn't a big deal to me, others might be more concerned with this.My only complaint with this lens is that, unlike my other two Canon IS USM zoom lenses, it will extend under it's own weight when the camera is facing down.  And there is no lock (again, unlike my other two lenses) to keep it in it's shortest length during transport.  This annoys me when I'm carrying the camera.Comparing pictures taken with this lens to those taken with my 70-300 lens (at 70 and 135...the widest two lengths common to both lenses)...this lens seemed to have slightly more vivid colors, and a wider DOF.  The depth of field was to be expected, I'd think, given the shorter lens and slightly larger aperture.  The more vivid colors, I guess, could be explained the same way, though the difference was very small.  Both lenses produced very nice results, IMO.My lens was a white-box lens...which was not mentioned in the product description.  I half-expected this, given that the price I paid was low...lower even than the current prime price shown on Amazon for this item.  But I would like to have seen the item description accurately state this up front.  The lens came wrapped in a single layer of bubble-wrap inside a plain white cardboard box.  This was, in turn, shipped inside a slightly larger box and padded with packing paper.  There was no documentation or software included (save for the warranty card, which WAS included), as you'd get with a lens sold in retail packaging...so be aware that this is the case.

It's quite a stunning thing to see photos with this lens shot with a little XSi. Once you have enough skill to get your modes set right you can be shooting portraits, animals, flowers, product shots (I do a lot of that) and a ton of other great stuff with this bit of glass.If your shooting a crop body like I do, you'll need a wide angle lens for those landscape and indoor shots where this thing doesn't get wide enough. I use a Sigma 20mm f/1.8 for those times. It's a great standard lens for crop bodies, the sharpness and depth of field effects you can get from opening up that big 1.8 aperture are stunning.But this Tamron zoom is no slouch either when it comes to bokeh and sharpness. Stop it down to 4 or so and in decent light it will give you excellent sharpness, contrast and color. I find I seldom reach for the 20mm except when I want to get right up next to a flower or insect or maybe a piece of jewelry in a product photo, open the aperture and get really smeared backgrounds.You can do that with the Tamron. But the Sigma seems to produce the better backgrounds in those situations. You just have to get real close and personal with the camera.Last fall we were camping at a local reservoir in central PA during the height of the fall colors when I found a huge spider in a fully formed, quite beautiful web. It had recently rained and the web had a lot of those nice dewy droplets on its filaments. I was able, with this Tamron, to get very close to spidey and web, choke off a lot of depth of field and soften the water and multicolored trees in the background to a beautiful palette of color with only hints of shape. That was one of the best series of shots I've ever taken, and it was with this lens. Stopped down a bit to give more form to the background and spidey was in a whole new light.This lens works for weddings and birthdays, school plays, picnics, tourism, whatever.If you need more zoom than this, maybe you should buy a telescope. I can see needing a wider lens than this, but if you can't zoom close enough, shoot RAW and enlarge. This zoom range is perfect for 90% of my image composition within the range it shoots.It's much easier to compose than with my 20mm Sigma prime. Any prime lens will have you walking around, backing up, moving in, trying to get that frame right. The payoff is unbeatable sharpness and speed per dollar.However, this 2.8 zoom lens is plenty fast, and very sharp as well.I bought this lens a couple years ago for under $400. The Sigma prime cost more than that, and I only use it for about ten percent of my shots.This thing is so far beyond the price in terms of capability, that I will buy another one if this one ever breaks.Recommended.

Well now on to the review. As many other reviewers have noted, this camera is not perfect - yes, the pictures do look blurry at pixel level, the noise reduction is heavy handed, the battery takes a while to charge, the GPS is a bit slow, the flash is a bit overpowering at times and a point  I would like to note - the lens wobbles - yes, if you touch it while it is extended you will see that it has quite a bit of lateral play - don't worry it won't fall off :-). But even after all these common gripes, this is a pocket full of fun - for all you photographers out there - this camera can truly keep you entertained for months on end.This finally replaces my all time favorite P&S; - the Fuji F30 that has been traveling in my backpack nonstop for 5+ years. No, I am not disposing the F30 - I have not found a single P&S; to date that can best the low light performance and I am keeping it till the day it dies out on me.Back to the HX9V. I have only one advise for serious shooters - please do not shy away from using the scene modes and the iAuto and Superior Auto modes ... yes, it is fun to tweak the shutter speed / aperture / iso etc. in the manual and program modes. However, do remember that the best photos that you will get is when you allow the camera to do it's electronic magic on the picture processing - so while  manual modes make us happy to be in control, it is the auto modes that gets you the best shots!Before I finally zeroed down on the HX9V, I did consider both the Nikon S9100 and the Canon 230 - the Nikon lost out owing to the slightly inferior image stabilization and the Canon owing to the slightly narrower lens (28mm versus 24mm on the Sony). I am sure those two are great products as well, but to me the extended feature set of the Sony were just too compelling. And it does take very nice photos in every lighting condition that you can imagine. As you can imagine, daylight shots are a snap for this camera ... if you want to challenge it, try a low light landscape shot at 100 ISO on a tripod - the results will blow you away. Not carrying a tripod? Set it to Superior Auto and shoot hand held for a very nice result that will look great on a 8"" x 10"" print.And of course for everyone interested in shooting HD Video - this is just the best one out there now - period. It replaces my Flip UltraHD - that used to take great videos but the Sony with it's optical zoom, stereo sound AND optical image stabilization while shooting Video is just too good.Don't hesitate - this one is a winner!

If you are looking for a very light accessory for your iPad Mini then this case is not for you. The case is also pretty hard to open up and insert your iPad Mini into.

It imbues one with a confidence that the case will protect your iPad Mini from most falls and bumps, although I have not been brave enough to venture an actual physical test. The case detaches from the keyboard, and it allows you to use the iPad by itself. All ports are covered with rubberized plugs, but they are easily pulled back and allow the ports to be easily accessed with chords.The keyboard paired up with my iPad Mini very easily and without any hitches. It also maintained connection for the duration of use.  The keyboard is charged through a micro USB slot on the side. (An Apple compatible charging port might have been a more appropriate choice, but knowing how reluctant Apple is to let the third-party vendors use its ports, this was likely not going to happen.) The keyboard is very responsive, and I for the most part like the key action. However, this sized keyboard is VERY cramped, and you really don't want to be using it for composing longer documents.The arm that attaches the case to the keyboard allows for your iPad to rotate through an arbitrary angle. However, only the portrait and the landscape orientations will be useful for the most part. I found the landscape orientation to be unstable though - I either had to allow the iPad Mini to ""dangle"" above the keyboard, or pull it out so far that the connecting arm becomes detached. If you are planning on typing in an on-the-go situation far away from a desk, then all of this is less than optimal.The case/keyboard combo is very well made.

That being said the Roku 3 is the fifth Roku I have personally installed. It is amazing that its ease of setup continues to get ever better. Take it out of the box, peel off the protective plastic, hook up the HDMI cable to your TV or monitor and the back of the Roku 3, connect the power brick and a Ethernet cable and you're done. That's it, you can't complain about 3 cables now can you?Unlike many other products, the Roku has no power button, it consumes so little power it really doesn't need one. This means when you are ready to watch a show, there is no waiting. I knew from previous models (Roku 2) to put batteries (included) in the remote prior to going through setup. This ensures the Roku finds the remote and synchs up with it right away. Speaking of the remote, the new Roku 3 remote has an earphone jack built right into it's side. What a great feature, now when sitting in bed you can easily add earphones so as to watch TV without ever bothering the other half. The volume control is handled by two buttons on the opposite side of the remote, just where they should be. It is features like this that demonstrate the folks at Roku actually use their own products and pay close attention to detail. Small things like this really make the experience much more pleasurable.Once you have powered on, the mostly automatic setup is a breeze and super easy to deal with. Just for the sake of seeing how well it worked, I connected the Roku 3 through both a Ethernet cable and over wireless to my dual Netgear wireless router. Added the Mac: address to the router and had it reserve an IP. Ran the wireless detection and it configured first time through without a hitch. Then I switched the cable for the faster speed over the gigabit network. I can always fall back on the wireless in case something goes bonkers with the cables.Once the Roku 3 was up and running with my Roku account, it downloaded the new firmware, updated all my channels and I played a game of Angry Birds Space. Love the new remote, really works well for playing games like Angry Birds. As much as I like Angry Birds, it was time to put the Roku to it's best use, watching movies in HD on my 27&#34; monitor.

With a great new interface which allows you to go right where you need, to change between network types, interface themes, audio modes, time, etc. you'll be watching and playing within minutes of opening the box.This new Roku is a real pleasure to use, never even looked at the literature that came with it and was watching a new release HD movie in under 15 minutes, and two of those were waiting for the popcorn in the microwave.

Especially switching back and fourth screens to switch from letter to numbers and other characters. This Keyboard Case had good and bad Amazon reviews. I took a chance and bought one. It works really well.  Keys are understandably smaller than a Standard Keyboard size, but functional. Can a good Typist smoothly type on this? Probably, but it is more for Hunt and Peck Typists like myself who seldom have both hands crowding the keyboard at the same time. Pros: Full Keyboard with individual Cut/Copy/and Paste buttons. And CD/DVD Play/Pause/FF/RR/Vol up/Vol down/Mute/Screen Brighter/Screen Dimmer/Home/and Search keys. Useful stuff. It has a left and a right Shift keys, BUT the right shift key is the same size as a standard letter key. That angered some reviewers. Me, I could care less cause I don't use that one anyhow.  It also has a DELETE key. BUT, it does not act like a Delete key. It does the exact same thing as the BACKSPACE key. Why they even included it if it wouldn't correctly Delete, is just wrongheaded. The complaints about the charging plugs for the keyboard and Ipad NOT fitting into their charging sockets when the case is closed doesn't apply to this model, because they DO both easily plug in when the case is closed. Trent must have modified the cutouts in the case to accommodate the plugs, because this no longer is an issue.  The Ipad instantly sleeps when the lid is closed so, no more shutting it off or turning it on. The Keyboard sleeps when not used for several minutes, and takes one or two key taps to awaken it again. On a single overnight charge, the keyboard lasts about 10-16 hours of heavy use, so, you need'nt charge it EVERY night for average daily couple hour keyboard usage.  I charge mine once every 4 or 5 days. A small green CHARGE light starts to flash, when it thinks it needs charging soon. Trent put this large CONNECT button on the top of the keyboard, as if it gets used often, but I only initially had to use it for it to find the Ipad. Haven't used it since. There is also a ON/Off switch, but I never use it, since the keyboard sleeps when not being used, and it uses very little juice while sleeping. There is even a Caps Lock LED at the top of the keyboard. It comes with a Key covering membrane sheet to protect the keys from coffee spills. It is removable, and easy to lose, so I don't use it.  I use a Stylus for Internet Browsing. The great thing about this case, is when you get ready to close it up, the track that the Ipad rested in, can now be used to store your stylus. The gap is wide enough to easily remove the stylus when ready.  The Keyboard Has up/down/left/right Arrow keys, but they don't scroll pages. But one thing they CAN do, unlike the Ipad keyboard, is simplify cursor movement left and right in a typed email or Document to correct spelling or typo errors. YAY. That alone is worth the price for this keyboard.  I highly recommend you put a screen protector film on your Ipad, and ditch the Keyboard membrane. It also supposedly protects the screen from the hard plastic keys when the case is closed, but a Screen Protector will do that, and no Membrane to lose. I also highly recommend you passcode protect the Ipad if you carry the case around a lot, here's why: When the case is closed and the Ipad if sleeping, and the keyboard is sleeping, if you squeeze the case, it presses down on the keyboard keys, which wakes up the Ipad and the Keyboard. The Keyboard gets bored after several minutes of no use, and goes back to sleep. But if the Ipad is not Passcode protected, it will remain on, and use battery juice. If it IS passcode protected, it will pop up a Passcode screen, and if you don't respond in 60 seconds, it goes back to sleep.  This is a really nice looking case. It has Leather-like accents. May be Leather, may not. Looks good. I get many compliments on this case. The Ipad part removes easily, for playing games, or reading ibooks. All Ipad Control buttons and camera are not obstructed by the case. I also recommend that if you are planning to use this case on a lap sitting in a chair, or in bed, get a lap table. One of those table like things with a Lap pad on the bottom, so the case has a flat, stable surface to rest on. Otherwise the Ipad will tip out of its Track in the keyboard case. There are 3 adjustable positions for Ipad tilt, to reduce overhead lighting glare.  For the price, this is a pretty good Product. It won't make your Ipad replace a Laptop Computer, but it outshines that dopey Touchscreen Keyboard that Apple forced us to use. And it is much cheaper, and better looking than the Keyboard case Apple sells.  Another thing I did, was buy the Yellow High-Glow Enlarged Keyboard Number/Letter stickers (from Amazon).  I had to trim every one down to fit, since they are for Standard sized Keys. But, in a very dark room I can now easily see the keys to type just from the glow of the Ipad screen at 3/4 Ipad brightness. Bigger, bolder letters and numbers.**** UPDATE 1 year later:  ****  This keyboard is starting to suck bigtime.  It double-strokes letters too often. And, too often, the letter keys I press while typing, do not register.  For some reason the Ipad spell check/correct does not work with this keyboard, so as I am typing along, I look back to see all the typing errors.  I am spending way too much time correcting, undetected typing errors.  Another thing,...when the keyboard was new, it was instantly recognized by the iPad. Nothing to initiate.  NOW, I have to go to settings in iPad, at startup, and manually connect the keyboard every time.  Also, the battery life of the keyboard after a full charge, is about 2 hours, before typing errors get really bad.There is no remaining charge time for the keyboard, so it's a crap shoot as to how much time is left, after standing by for any length of time.  I will be buying a better keyboard. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(5962, 5976)",5,0.0,False

Getting the new flagship model every three or four years was something I did for a long time, but when D-SLRs came along, I began downsizing after the EOS 1Ds I got in 2004. In 2007 I moved to EOS 40D and, although losing the full-size sensor was a sacrifice, it was a step in the right direction. With my recent purchase of the T3i, it's another move away from the professional models.Why would I do that? It's not so much the cost of new cameras that has shaped my decisions to downgrade; it's the size. While professional equipment is important to me, so are professional looking photos. And the truth is, after the newness wears off a D-SLR, I tend frequently to leave the big gun behind and rely on an advanced compact or ultrazoom for most of my shooting. As a result, I have more point-and-shoot pictures than I do pro quality ones.This tendency has ended with the purchase of the T3i. The camera is modestly sized, and I never leave home without it. With the 18-55mm kit lens (very nice little lens for its specs) or 24-105L, it's not any bigger than the Fuji Finepix HS10 I leaned on for most of my shooting this past year. And while the HS10 is hands down the best ultrazoom camera I ever used, the difference in image quality, performance and even video between it and the T3i is night and day.The T3i may not be blazing fast like my 1Ds or the 40D, but 90% of the shooting I do is not that kind of photography, anyway. What the T3i excels at is image quality. I have a whole raft of photos that, eked and tweaked to maximum effect in Photoshop, are only a little better than average because they were taken with a point-and-shoot camera. This camera's image quality, I'm happy to say, is superlative! So are the videos. Rebel T3i is almost too good to be true.An articulating LCD is something I've come to insist upon, and this one is by far the best I've ever used. I don't use Live View every time, but I've certainly been in that mode a lot more frequently with this model than with the 40D! In review mode, the refresh rate is a bit slow when zooming in to look at details, but it's not as slow as reviewing pictures on, say, Panasonic DMC-ZS7. (I did test Canon EOS 60D at Best Buy and noticed that the refresh rate is much faster on that model--perhaps because of the larger battery--but it's really not enough of an issue to deduct a star.)The resolution of the LCD is superb, and because it can be tilted and twisted to advantage, it can be viewed even in strong sunlight.Although the nine-point autofocus system is getting criticism for lagging behind Nikon, focus is swift and accurate. At 3.7 fps, burst mode is cut nearly in half from my 40D's 6.5 fps, but so far this has not hampered my ability to catch fast moving subjects.I appreciate the Lighting Optimizer function and use it a lot under the harsh lighting conditions in the desert where I live. It is of incalculable value.I have yet to haul out the owner's manual, thanks to the on-board guide. Of course it helps that I've owned Canon D-SLRs before, but adjusting settings on this camera is a lot different than on my previous ones. There have been some settings I would have normally needed to consult a manual for, but it hasn't been necessary because the answers are in-camera. (I never shoot in Auto, by the way. I'm a manual mode kinda gal.)Because images are very clean up to ISO 1600 and are usable even at ISO 6400, taking along the Speedlight flash so far has not been necessary. Yet another plus with this Canon iteration.There's something about blown highlights that really sets my teeth on edge, but that has not been a problem, thanks to the T3i's Highlight Tone Priority function. Dynamic range is very good to excellent, even a hair better than my 40D. Colors are more accurate, too. I prefer the contrast one stop under the camera's default setting, which is, admittedly, fairly punchy and will result in a blown highlight here and there. Reducing contrast just a tad fixes that.Eighteen megapixel resolution is outstanding.Sometimes I think about the EOS 60D's speedier performance, more advanced autofocus system and that wonderful electronic level and wonder if I made the right choice.

It was nice to see how bright it was even during the daytime, windows all on one side of the room but no strong light as it is the start of winter and a basement.  Summer time it would be good to have curtains for light control like any projector.  When I get curtains up I am sure that will take care of any issues during daytime, even in summer. Of course as with any projector the more control over light in the room the better the picture. I did a lot of research before purchasing this unit. As a projector unless one has a totally dark room meaning zero light and dark walls then ANSI lumens are important, this one with its 2000 ANSI LUMENS is great and use this to compare with other projectors, if less I would be weary.I wanted to have a NATIVE 1080P RESOLUTION which I do not regret and would not get a projector with lower resolution. One may notice that a projectors specs say they can do 1080 but this is misleading as this is not NATIVE resolution, meaning they try to upconvert to a 1080i (i=interpolated) and it is not the same thing, not even close. I want to see blu rays in their full resolution which this does. One may also purchase an A/V receiver to upconvert the source material for best picture quality, my Blu Ray player also does this upconversion, but it is still not a true 1080P. While not as good as the 1080P one will see when playing a Blu Ray disc for example, the picture from HD cable channel which is 720P is still AMAZING just as good as the picture on my 42 inch LCD HDTV and better than my older 55 inch rear projection HDTV. High Def video from a home video source such as full 1080P from an AVCHD format camcorder for example is stunning and home movies look as good or better than store bought if done properly. The input source is of course going to dictate how good the picture is, so it will look as good as the source input, this is not always the case with all projectors, they have to have the capacity to project the image at full input resolution such as this one. Most projectors that have this resolution cost more and a flat panel in the screen sizes this is capable of are going to be many thousands of dollars more.I do not use the Eco setting but the bulbs last 3-4000 hours and are only around 120.00 and you only need one which is a very good deal.  One of the great and unique features of this projector are the LENS SHIFT adjustment wheels, this projector does not have to be dead center on with the screen as those knobs can shift the picture both vertically and horizontally, at least several inches or more depending on how far the projector is away from the screen, in some situations this could mean the difference between having a projector and screen work in a room or not. The lens shift moves the picture left to right or up and down keeping it in focus.  So your screen can be way off from being centered with the projector and still fit dead on.  The projector itself has plenty of features and adjustments but it did not take long to find a good setting close to out of the box. While this has 2 HDMI inputs I only use one with all of my components running through my A/V receiver, a Pioneer Elite VSX30 for 275 with 7.1 surround which I am very happy with.I got the Peerless mount that I think was a good choice, it fits this projector and is good quality with two nice pitch adjustment knobs. It is white and matches the color of the projector well. Since it is ceiling mounted it is up and out of the way of my dog and one has to be right up close to the screen before one would block the picture at all, standing in between the projector and screen with this set up does not shadow the screen.If one is going to ceiling mount this you may wish to purchase a longer power cord.  I bought a 15 foot power cord for this for about 8 bucks so it is long enough to plug in to my power conditioner, extension cords are a bad idea. This worked great for my ceiling installationCables To Go 09482 18 AWG Universal Power Cord, IEC320C13 to NEMA 5-15P (15 Feet)One can run cords through walls or you can do as I did and use conduit such as the product here which hides the cord and sticks on and requires no nails.Wiremold C210 White Cordmate II Kitso it looks like a nice clean installation.I also being on a budget bought the Favi 100 inch 16:9 widescreenFAVI HD-100 16:9/100-Inch Electric Projector Screenwhich works great and provides an awesome picture with this projector.  My set up surprises everyone that it did not cost much more. It comes in various sizes but 100 inches was the biggest that would fit.  There is information here on the pages of the FAVI screens for sale which will show you the dimensions of each screen size to help determine the size screen that will fit in your room.  In my case both the horizontal fit as well as how far the screen came down was important information.While all my components are capable of 3D I have not really liked 3D that much in the theater and decided I would not want to play much 3D content at home so I concentrated on brightness and the 1080P resolution and the adjustment features of this projector and zero regrets.  If I were to change my mind in the future when the technology has progressed I can revisit that, but for now this is all I could ever want.I like this better than the movie theater.  As the screen is smaller it is easier to get a high resolution picture.  The surround sound speakers which are the Energy Take Classic 5.1 set with the Energy CF-30 floor standing speakers (I got a great deal for 150 each new) make for wonderful sound.  There is plenty of great home theater equipment out there but this was the best for my budget at the time.  I would highly recommend a good audio set up to go along with the amazing picture quality you will have with this projector.If you purchase this and want some set up help there is a web site projector central (...) where you can enter your projector model and screen size and it's contrast ratio and seating location and other information and it has a wizard that will tell you the optimum distance to mount the projector from the screen and ideal seating distances and details such as that.  Very helpful in a successful installation. I used their calculations with perfect results.I also got a Harmony 1100 remote so that I don't need 6-7 remotes,Logitech Harmony 1100 Universal Remote with Color Touch ScreenI got that new for 200.00 (heck of a deal) and extra batteries on Amazon for 8.75 eachLogitech Battery for Harmony Remote Control 1000 1100 1100i 3.7V 1250mAh.  That works like a charm with it's touch screen.  I even got a IR dimmer switch that runs off its own remote or the Harmony remote. I also got the RF accessory so I can use either RF (which is not line of sight) or RF to IR for all the components, helpful if your components are behind your seating location.I highly recommend this projector.  I would not settle for one with lower resolution or lower lumen output, you would never obtain as high resolution as a full 1080P projector and you would not get the brightness necessary for daytime viewing if you do not have a room that is completely dark. On the other hand for $1050.00 you will be quite happy with the picture you get from this especially if the source is at least HD (720P) or using its full capability of 1080P quality like a Blu Ray. t  Not that it is bad with a regular definition channel or regular DVD, but you get your most amazing picture with the best input source just as is the case with any projector or TV. I can't emphasize enough how much the 1080P quality is worth.  This projector is simply the best deal for the money I could find. Consider this, if you want a large picture you can get a very large screen such as the Favi or many others that are at least 120 inches, this projector could potentially display a giant 300 inch picture if you have the space to do so.  But even at 100 inches like I have what else can you get for that money in this size with this resolution aside from a good projector? Very little and it is going to cost a lot more. And if you have an electric screen that moves out of the way you take up very little space when not in use and the projector itself takes up very little space. Also unlike a flat panel TV you have a set picture size.  With a projector like this you can just change your screen size while using the same projector and go smaller or larger with the screen size if you change the location which either constricts the size of the screen you are able to use or enlarges the space to allow for a larger screen.  This is a flexibility you will only find in a projector.  And with the lens shift of this particular projector you have even more flexibility for placement of the projector.Also consider that this weighs about 16 pounds out of the box.  An LCD flat panel HDTV would likely weight 100 plus for a large one.  So this give you a great portability.  The 100 inch screen I am using only weighs 27 pounds.  Both of which can be carried by one person.  That can not be said about a flat panel.  Flat panels are great.  I use them in smaller sizes at reasonable prices in locations they make sense.  But for a home theater you can't beat this for anywhere near the price and you will be stunned by how great the picture is from it.I can't say enough how happy I am. I took a month to research all this and made this decision.  The first time I put a show on the screen I instantly knew it was all I had hoped for.  It gets used on a daily basis and I have now used it for about 500 hours (the projector keeps track of lamp hours used) without a single issue.  In about one minute I have a projector which is always out of the way on the ceiling taking up no usable space in the room along with a screen also not taking up any usable space to having a 100 inch incredibly high resolution viewing experience night or day.  The only adjustments I make are to the projector by selecting ""Dynamic"" during the bright day time to ""Living Room"" which is slightly dimmer to avoid seeing any pixilation at night and that only takes a few seconds from the remote to change.UPDATE: I have been using this projector for over a year now.  No problems at all during this time, and still no regrets that I purchased this unit. I do find that I still prefer either an HD video source or BluRay whenever possible but that would be the same with any projector or HDTV, particularly one with a very large screen such as this is capable of. I still only use the two settings, one for daytime and one slightly less bright for night to avoid seeing any pixilation artifacts.BULB LIFE: Well my bulb finally went.  It lasted exactly 2837 hours.  Epson says that it will last between 3000-4000 hours so it was close.  Keep in mind that I have never used the Eco setting only full power.  I would urge anyone buying a replacement bulb to ONLY USE EPSON.  There are lots of knockoffs out there which are cheap and will not have the performance, life, possibly explode or other negative things.  Only the Epson lamp is worth buying.  It is of course the most expensive and I found a new one for about $60 less from another camera supply site than Amazon is offering it for right now.  But no regrets. I have had some awesome viewing of countless movies and football games and tv shows and whatever on the huge screen with a great picture for all this time.To extend the life of your lamp make sure that it has plenty of room for air to circulate around the projector, particularly the back where the air intake and filter are.  Vacuum the air filter from time to time and replace it with a new one when you change the bulb.  Also make sure to allow the lamp to cool down before moving the projector if it is not mounted on the ceiling like mine.  Those things will help give you the longest life.  I have read of people having significantly lower lamp life and I suspect they are not doing all those things.  I also have a in room air cleaner to help keep dust down in the room I have my projector and components for the home theater.  Keep it cool and clean and you will get the best lamp life.

It was nice to see how bright it was even during the daytime, windows all on one side of the room but no strong light as it is the start of winter and a basement.  Summer time it would be good to have curtains for light control like any projector.  When I get curtains up I am sure that will take care of any issues during daytime, even in summer. Of course as with any projector the more control over light in the room the better the picture. I did a lot of research before purchasing this unit. As a projector unless one has a totally dark room meaning zero light and dark walls then ANSI lumens are important, this one with its 2000 ANSI LUMENS is great and use this to compare with other projectors, if less I would be weary.I wanted to have a NATIVE 1080P RESOLUTION which I do not regret and would not get a projector with lower resolution. One may notice that a projectors specs say they can do 1080 but this is misleading as this is not NATIVE resolution, meaning they try to upconvert to a 1080i (i=interpolated) and it is not the same thing, not even close. I want to see blu rays in their full resolution which this does. One may also purchase an A/V receiver to upconvert the source material for best picture quality, my Blu Ray player also does this upconversion, but it is still not a true 1080P. While not as good as the 1080P one will see when playing a Blu Ray disc for example, the picture from HD cable channel which is 720P is still AMAZING just as good as the picture on my 42 inch LCD HDTV and better than my older 55 inch rear projection HDTV.

The key board is perfect for me but my partner says that they are a bit small for his fingers. ANSWERNOTFOUND,ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(633, 647)",5,0.0,False

In addition, all ports have covers which helps protect them from damage, dust, etc.2. The specs say that the case is shock proof and water resistant. Although I had no chance to verify this personally,  the fit seems tight and it would be difficult for water or dust to penetrate the case.3. The built in screen protector works very well. I removed the original screen protector from the iPad and then applied the built in screen protector. This did make it easier to install the iPad Air in the case and there were no bubbles or grids, as some people experienced,  on the screen. In addition, the touch screen feature of the iPad was very responsive and performed as if the screen protector were not there.4. With the case on, I found that the power, the home and the volume buttons were very responsive to light touch. There was no need to exert substantial pressure to get them to function properly.5. In my opinion, the star of the show is the leather hand strap on this case. It is very stylish, elegant, gives added protection from accidental drops of the device, and makes holding the device very comfortable.  It is adjustable to fit most hand sizes and rotatable to various angles for easy and comfortable viewing of the device. This feature reduces the fatigue of holding the device for long periods. Makes me wonder how did I live without this feature before.6.  The kickstand is made of metal and is very sturdy. It has a bottle opener on it.

I bought a couple of these cameras so that our rescue director can keep an eye on the puppy building and the kennel room while she's working on her computer, arranging adoptions.  It gives her peace of mind to be able to watch over the dogs during off-hours.  For $65 with Amazon Prime free shipping, this was something that I could afford to buy as a donation and the rescue is making excellent use of them.I installed ""IP Camera Viewer 2"" on her Mac, from the Mac App Store - and ""Foscam Viewer"" on her iPad.  Both apps were free and work great (although the Mac app doesn't support audio from this camera, it's still a great free app).I did review the lengthy negative app regarding issues some users have had with the camera.

It gives her peace of mind to be able to watch over the dogs during off-hours.

What was good is still good, when the connectivity is there.  When riding my motorcycle and the phone is mounted on my handlebars with nothing between me and the phone, connectivity is good and stays there.When I am doing yard work and the phone is on my right hip, connectivity is iffy.  And I get complaints of echoing and such intermittently.  I thought is was my phone because I had the Android 4.3 upgrade which trashed my wi-fi and I thought might have impacted my bluetooth as well but two weeks ago, I finally got a replacement phone.  The new Phone (Galaxy Note 2-Verizon) accepted the 4.3 and 4.4.2 updates with no issue to my wi-fi this time(YEA!) but the bluetooth issues are still there.  My son has the same headset with a galaxy S4 and the same problems.  My wife has the same headset on her Iphone-4 and no issues.  Go figure.So, my recommendation is this:1)  Buy it, try it out heavily and return it if it does not work.2)  If you have problems, Do not wait to return it or maybe get a fix from LG.  I waited too long and the warranty ran out.When it works, the sound is GREAT.  Good bass (well, let's just say my ears like it but I do have a bit of hearing loss so fidelity is no big deal for me).  Good volume.  Works great with my laptop and android tablet.The sad part is a cheap Bluetooth v2.1 works better with my phone than this one.I purchased this headset for one specific reason.  To be able to listen to music and communicate on the phone when riding my motorcycle.  I did not purchase through Amazon but a local big box store who did price match Amazon.I am going to look for a Bluetooth v4.0.  maybe that will work better.  Note, the v2.1 that work better fit me terribly.  I've got a big head and those did not have enough STRETCH to get around the back of my head.Setup Description:I have the LG730 paired with a Galaxy Note II phone (Verizon).  The phone does not have the stock battery, it has a 9300mah extended battery(warranty ZeroLemon Protection Guarantee CompatibleI mention this because it may be part of the problem I do occasionally have with the headset under the CON section.  I use the case provided by ZeroLemon for my phone.I mount my Galaxy Note 2 on my motorcycle (2007 Goldwing) using a RAM Mount for the phone (RAM Universal X Grip Tablet Tabletsand the handlebar (RAM Mounting RAM B 174 LO4U Reservoir Lowrance.  I bought the wrong phone mount initially but just flipped the prongs around to the smaller set on the back and it works great.  No fear of vibration.  I used it on a 1600 mile trip two weeks ago with no problems.I have a 3/4 Vega helmet with a face shield that I usually have lowered.  I also wear a heavy motorcycle jacket (not a leather jacket but a heavy duty nylon jacket with Kevlar protectors and such).  The LG730 sits inside the jacket and I zip the jack all the way up but leave the collar open to be able to get to the answer button.  The ear buds have no issues as long as I have them stretched out all the way.  I only wear one, not two when riding so check your state laws on that ([...]  I can turn my head left or right and not pull the bud out of my right ear.Usage Experience:PRO:Sound Quality:  Excellent compared to the helmet speakers I was using.  Good Bass and volume levels that are adjustable both on the phone and the headset so you can get the mix you want.  I am NOT an audiophile so I'm not concerned about the highest hi's or the lowest lows.  I just want to hear the music and hold a conversation.Microphone:  Very Good.  I made several test calls to multiple people while riding my motorcycle.  Up until about 40 MPH, they could not tell I was on a motorcycle.

What was good is still good, when the connectivity is there.  When riding my motorcycle and the phone is mounted on my handlebars with nothing between me and the phone, connectivity is good and stays there.When I am doing yard work and the phone is on my right hip, connectivity is iffy.  And I get complaints of echoing and such intermittently.  I thought is was my phone because I had the Android 4.3 upgrade which trashed my wi-fi and I thought might have impacted my bluetooth as well but two weeks ago, I finally got a replacement phone.  The new Phone (Galaxy Note 2-Verizon) accepted the 4.3 and 4.4.2 updates with no issue to my wi-fi this time(YEA!) but the bluetooth issues are still there.  My son has the same headset with a galaxy S4 and the same problems.  My wife has the same headset on her Iphone-4 and no issues.  Go figure.So, my recommendation is this:1)  Buy it, try it out heavily and return it if it does not work.2)  If you have problems, Do not wait to return it or maybe get a fix from LG.  I waited too long and the warranty ran out.When it works, the sound is GREAT.  Good bass (well, let's just say my ears like it but I do have a bit of hearing loss so fidelity is no big deal for me).  Good volume.  Works great with my laptop and android tablet.The sad part is a cheap Bluetooth v2.1 works better with my phone than this one.I purchased this headset for one specific reason.  To be able to listen to music and communicate on the phone when riding my motorcycle.  I did not purchase through Amazon but a local big box store who did price match Amazon.I am going to look for a Bluetooth v4.0.  maybe that will work better.  Note, the v2.1 that work better fit me terribly.  I've got a big head and those did not have enough STRETCH to get around the back of my head.Setup Description:I have the LG730 paired with a Galaxy Note II phone (Verizon).  The phone does not have the stock battery, it has a 9300mah extended battery(warranty ZeroLemon Protection Guarantee CompatibleI mention this because it may be part of the problem I do occasionally have with the headset under the CON section.  I use the case provided by ZeroLemon for my phone.I mount my Galaxy Note 2 on my motorcycle (2007 Goldwing) using a RAM Mount for the phone (RAM Universal X Grip Tablet Tabletsand the handlebar (RAM Mounting RAM B 174 LO4U Reservoir Lowrance.  I bought the wrong phone mount initially but just flipped the prongs around to the smaller set on the back and it works great.  No fear of vibration.  I used it on a 1600 mile trip two weeks ago with no problems.I have a 3/4 Vega helmet with a face shield that I usually have lowered.  I also wear a heavy motorcycle jacket (not a leather jacket but a heavy duty nylon jacket with Kevlar protectors and such).  The LG730 sits inside the jacket and I zip the jack all the way up but leave the collar open to be able to get to the answer button.  The ear buds have no issues as long as I have them stretched out all the way.  I only wear one, not two when riding so check your state laws on that ([...]  I can turn my head left or right and not pull the bud out of my right ear.Usage Experience:PRO:Sound Quality:  Excellent compared to the helmet speakers I was using.  Good Bass and volume levels that are adjustable both on the phone and the headset so you can get the mix you want.  I am NOT an audiophile so I'm not concerned about the highest hi's or the lowest lows.  I just want to hear the music and hold a conversation.Microphone:  Very Good.  I made several test calls to multiple people while riding my motorcycle.  Up until about 40 MPH, they could not tell I was on a motorcycle.

I wanted something that I could view remotely from my desktop at work and my iPhone4.  I had done quite a bit of searching around for a solid IP camera before I settled on this.  I had looked at d-link, tenvis, wanscam, and others.  However, none of those had the number of views that Foscam had or the number of helpful setup tips.  Soo after long deliberation I decided this was reasonable to get even after I had some concerns related to reviews and security.  To break it down further -What I like:+Price+Size of the camera (It is not an extremely large camera by any means.  Good to keep ""hidden"" in a tight location)+IR cut (Adds a more realistic color.  Not washed out.  Take a look at AwkwardHamster's youtube video comparing other foscam models)+Accessing the camera remotely (It's good once you get pass the setup portion, which I explain in my comments)+Picture quality - Good (Don't expect it to be the sharpest quality.  You are not going to see a hair on the ground 5 feet away.  If you are expecting long distance use with this camera don't expect amazing quality images)+Wide variety of settingsWhat I didn't like:-Power cord (~3ft, who does that?)-Reviews, a bit off topic but I want to make a comment about all of them.  Now I didn't like that so many reviews on Amazon start off by saying ""I couldn't get my camera to connect so I contacted 'insert name here' from Foscam.  They connected the cameras in no time and were extremely helpful'.  At the time of this review 703 similar statements.  Now I find this somewhat fishy that 703 comments are similar.  It seems to me that it is a modified template for comments.  I can't say whether these statements are true or not but just keep it in mind that some if not all may be false comments.  Just my 2 cents.-Minimal information on remote DNS providers.  DNS provider - used to access camera outside of your home network.-Security encryption.  From what I have read in other comments this camera has no security when you try and remotely access this camera.  If you attempt to access it remotely your username/password is sent in ""Plain Text"".  This means if you use public wifi your password can be ""sniffed"" out.  Now this might of concern to some and others it's no big deal.  So I suggest for some to do more research on how to access your camera securely.  I personally plan on setting up the camera for viewing through a VPN (virtual private network).  I haven't done it yet but the goal is to purchase a router that has VPN capability and install tomato or dd-wrt.Stuck between like/don't like:>Camera setup.  This is a tough one.  Many people say turn away from this camera unless you have a degree in computer science because it is almost impossible to setup.  This is not necessarily true if you find the right steps online.  I didn't follow the owners manual for the setup or use the CD the camera came with.  I followed one reviewers steps and I got the camera up and running in no time.Camera Setup:I followed ""R. Tickle's"" instructions from March 29, 2012 to set the camera up.  Here is what he used with slight modifications and explanations that may make it easier for some.1) Do NOT install the software on the CD.  The CD is used to try and find the camera.  On my first attempt to access my camera I did toss the CD in and install the software, but unfortunately I was left with a blank text box with no camera IP.  The manual said I should reinstall the software so I did.  That didn't work so I decided to find it using my router web login explained below.2) Connect the camera by Cat-5 wire to your router.  My camera came with a coiled up cat-5 cable.  You shouldn't have to go searching for one.3) Login to your router (via browser, for linksys it is 192.168.1.1) and find the IP address assigned to your camera.  This should be fairly easy to do especially if you have the Linksys smart router.  Navigate to your connected devices and copy the cameras IP address.4) Login to the camera at that IP address (via browser) and IMMEDIATELY turn OFF the DHCP.  Copy and Paste the IP address for the camera into a new blank tab and hit enter.  This should take you to the foscam page that shows activex, server push mode, and mobile phone.  If you use IE select activex, firefox/chrome use server push mode.  Selecting one of those will give you a pop-up for username/password.  The default username/password is : Username-admin, there is no password.  Once you get in you can navigate to ""Basic Network Settings""  and uncheck DHCP.5) Give your camera a fixed IP address on your network and fill in the subnet mask with what you normally use.  This step is pretty simple.  You can assign your camera an IP address.  I used the IP it was initially assigned except I changed the last three numbers xxx.xxx.x.151.  Next you want to fill in the subnet mask, which can be found in your router settings or I believe it mostly is 255.255.255.0 (per google search of course).  Enter in your gateway IP and DNS server IP (you will use the same IP address for both of these.  you can find this IP address from your router login page in maybe a ""local networks"" tab it should be the IP address of your router).  The last thing you can fill in is the HTTP port.  Select a four digit number such as ""5252"".  Remember this because it will be used to setup port forwarding.  Now hit SUBMIT and wait for the camera to reboot.  Now that you have your IP address for your camera nailed down you may wish to go into your router and assign the IP camera a static IP address.  This ensures another device will not accidentally take your foscam IP address.6) Fill in the SSID, encryption type, and share key used by your wireless network.  Hit SUBMIT, this will reboot the camera.  Now you you can unplug the camera from your router.  ***NOTE*** I have found that once you enable wireless on the camera it may take some time to actually connect to your wifi network.  So if you reboot your camera be patient (more than 1 minute patient).  Watch the camera for the green LED to have a steady and consistent blink.  Any hesitation in blinking means it has not connected yet.7) Re-login to the camera at the new fixed IP address to verify that everything's working and your settings have stayed.8) Login to your router and set a port-forwarding entry to map to the fixed IP address and HTTP port you gave your camera.  You will also have to enter in the device IP address, the one you just gave the camera.9) Now in order to access the camera remotely you will need a DDNS service.  Foscam now recommends ""no-ip"" for free DNS instead of dydns.  Do a google search for it.  Create an account.  Foscam has their own service free for 3 years but after that you will have to pony up some money.  No-ip is free but and has one downfall, every 30 days you will need to say you will keep the DNS assigned to you.  I haven't had the service for more than 30 days, but from what I have found online you receive an email and have to navigate to a link that is in the email.  I guess this is the price you pay for a free service.10) Go back to your camera settings.  Select DDNS Service Settings then Select third party DDNS drop down and find no-ip.  Enter your username and password.  This is the information you used on the no-ip site to create an account.  Finally you will want to enter in the ddns host.  This is what you set up to be your camera website/host.  Example:  mycamera01(dot)no-ip(dot)biz.  Sorry about the dots, trying to avoid having information blocked.  Now click SUBMIT and wait for the camera to reboot.11) Now try and access your camera using your new host.  You can try this from 3G/4G to make sure you can connect outside your home network.  Open browser tab and enter in all the host information.  Using my example: mycamera01(dot)no-ip(dot)biz:5252.  If you notice I entered  :5252  after the host name.  This is because we changed it earlier in step 5.12) You now should be able to connect remotely.  Since the hard part is done go and change your username and password to the camera if you haven't done that yet.I hope these steps help lower the frustration of setting up this camera.My final comment!!IP Camera APPS. I mentioned earlier that I had an iPhone and wanted to access the cameras for remote viewing.  After much searching I decided to download ""LiveCams Pro"" right now $3.99 in the appstore.  I selected it after seeing others recommend it and seeing all the cameras they support.  I may or may not want a different camera manufacturer such as d-link and the app supports them.  However, this is not the only app available, Foscam has an app (not free) that you can download.  From what I have found it works well but other than that I haven't had experience with it.I will update with my opinion of the camera as time goes on.  Feel free to check back in a few months.

No more. This camera can take shots as good -and sometimes better- as my trusted DSLR.Take a look at my sample shots at [...]PORTABILITYThis camera fits in my hand, in my pocket and in my laptop bag. In fact, I am using the case for my wife's Lumix TZ8. I can bring this camera with me anywhere.One big advantage is safety: if you travel to places that are not 100% safe, any potential robber would mistake it with a cheap $200 camera. More importantly, you will nevr have to leave this camera in a hotel room, on the trunk of your car, or will have to carry a big backpack with camera and accessories.Why this is size so important? You miss 100% of the shots you can't take because you cannot bring your camera. Because this is a camera you will carry anywhere. There have been many business trips, weekend opportunities and just in the moment photo opportunities where it was not practical or safe to bring my big DSLR. That is no longer a problem with a portable camera like this that gives me all the quality and control I need as an experienced photographer.The only downside to size it that it looks pretty ridiculous to have this camera mounted on a tripd (as I did last night taking skyline shots at dusk) and that you don't have the `professional' look of sdomeone carrying a large camera with a big lens, which sometimes is useful getting access to normally unavailable areas for tourists.QUALITYSony has been improving the quality of its digital cameras steadily for the last few years.  In February of 2011 I got a HX5V which was quite impressive, and delivered quality images even when compared with a DSLR except for low-light and other tricky situations.

No more. This camera can take shots as good -and sometimes better- as my trusted DSLR.Take a look at my sample shots at [...]PORTABILITYThis camera fits in my hand, in my pocket and in my laptop bag. In fact, I am using the case for my wife's Lumix TZ8. I can bring this camera with me anywhere.One big advantage is safety: if you travel to places that are not 100% safe, any potential robber would mistake it with a cheap $200 camera. More importantly, you will nevr have to leave this camera in a hotel room, on the trunk of your car, or will have to carry a big backpack with camera and accessories.Why this is size so important? You miss 100% of the shots you can't take because you cannot bring your camera. Because this is a camera you will carry anywhere. There have been many business trips, weekend opportunities and just in the moment photo opportunities where it was not practical or safe to bring my big DSLR. That is no longer a problem with a portable camera like this that gives me all the quality and control I need as an experienced photographer.The only downside to size it that it looks pretty ridiculous to have this camera mounted on a tripd (as I did last night taking skyline shots at dusk) and that you don't have the `professional' look of sdomeone carrying a large camera with a big lens, which sometimes is useful getting access to normally unavailable areas for tourists.QUALITYSony has been improving the quality of its digital cameras steadily for the last few years.

Living in Wisconsin, I am a die-hard Packers fan, and being a nursing student, cable is just too expensive for me. I started researching this antenna out of desperation because the antenna tower setup at my rental house is very outdated, and the cable connecting the antennas that are at the top of the 60ft tower is so thin, it looses an immense amount of signal. Anyway, I live about 36 miles from the Milwaukee towers, and about 50 from the Chicago towers. I already had the Antennacraft HBU33, which is an absolutely PHENOMENAL antenna if you are more then 40 miles from a tower (I have never used it for signals more the 50 miles away, so keep that in mind). This antenna (ANT751R, and make sure the ""R"" is at the end of the model number, as the model with the ""R"" is optimized for digital signal, as opposed to the older model which was more for analog signal) is designed for signals within the 40 mile range. I used my old antenna for Chicago stations, and bought this antenna for the Milwaukee stations. The setup works very well so far. I use both antennas with a signal combiner (a splitter that works both ways) and a RCA TVPRAMP1R for a pre-amp, and the picture so far is awesome. This antenna is so small, it seems like it would be ineffective, but WOW, its works like a champ! I will warn you that it does not pick up the lower VHF stations very well (2-6), so I had to modify it with coathangers to pick up those stations (Fox is channel 6 here, which a majority of Packer games are on). I did have to change the location of the antenna after not getting good reception on fox, even with adjustments with coathangers, to a higher place with fewer obstructions (the original place was clamped to the antenna tower as high as I could reach (which was about 10 ft up with a ladder), and was obstructed by the house next door, so your antenna may not have the low VHF issue, but I am not willing to take off my coathanger modification to find out if it works without it (if it ain't broke, don't fix it) in the new location. It is now on the roof of my porch, which is about 20 feet in the air. I also installed this antenna in the attic of my friend's 1 story house who is about 15 miles form the Milwaukee tower, and he reports perfect reception even without any sort of amp. Keep in mind that he was using a radio shack amplified set-top antenna before with a 15-20db amp built in, and on windy days, the reception would be choppy at best. He checked the reception on the day that the winds from hurricane Sandy were really bad in his area, and reported the signal was completely solid, so there you go. When installing this antenna, I would HIGHLY recommend using quad-shielded type f coax cable, to minimize signal loss. I would recommend purchasing the cable from monoprice, they were the lowest price when I installed my friend's antenna. Also, be careful with amplifiers, they can actually destroy your signal if your signal is already strong, so just keep that in mind. If you are at the very edge of the reception zone for this antenna, and your antenna is in a low place, or in your attic, then you may want to look into a pre-amp, otherwise, don't even bother.So to recap: This is a fantastic antenna that may not pick up the low VHF stations very well. I made a long loop with a coathanger and used hose clamps to attach them to the end of the VHF elements to get better low VHF signal, but that's just a suggestion. If you are putting the antenna up high, you may not have anything to worry about it. USE QUAD-SHIELDED TYPE F CABLE FOR YOUR SETUP TO MAXIMIZE GAIN AND MINIMIZE SIGNAL LOSS.

I was lying down while listening but they stay firm when sitting up as well. The headband is soft and fabric covered so it doesn't catch in your hair.Appearance: They are sleek looking - a little bulky but sleek for this style of headphones.
