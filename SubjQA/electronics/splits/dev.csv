This part really takes away from the product since not all apps (and for good reason) are Chromecast compatible.  That being said you can also view all computer related items on Windows or Mac.

Granted, you can tell the difference between this lens and the much more expensive L version, but as far as picture quality goes, the difference is not so obvious.Bokeh you obtain with such a wide aperature is terrific for portraits, at aperatures from 1.4-2.0 there is some softness to the lens which gives portraits a bit of a ""dreamy"" look.  This is desired from many, but I don't particularly care for it.  Nevertheless, shots become extremely sharp after 2.0 and continue to improve to f 8.0.As far as whether you should purchase this particular lens or the less expensive 1.8 model, it really comes down to personal preference.

The base unit itself has a toggle switch that lets you select between 3 channels. I have 3 units, all set to different channels, so I can tune into which ever one I want to at the time, and my brother and sister can too.

The headset itself is also a bit heavy, so if you plan on leaning forward with them on, be ready to keep them from sliding off your head.

I can say if you don't really need 1080p then there's really no need to get the newer version. Only a few sources at this point are 1080p. The iTunes store is the main source where you will greatly benefit from the 1080p. There are quite a few tv shows and movies in 1080p in the iTunes store to rent or buy. If your buying this device for 1080p on Netflix then there still aren't that many movies or tv shows. Also it's very hard to find which ones are 1080p.  Unlike the iTunes store which has icons for HD which means 720p and other icons for 1080p. The Netflix app only has icons for standard definition and HD. From my experience Netflix streaming had very bad picture quality.  The picture seemed to be artifacted and pixelated even with HD content. I had no issues with same content on my apple tv 2 or any of my other netlix devices on my 32mbps connection. I'm guessing that my apple tv 3 was defective as I haven't heard complaints of my issues. There are many threads on macrumor forums and apple discussions forums about the same issue. From my experience the picture quality was only bad on Netflix. Regardless of my issues I still feel the apple tv 3 is not up to par with other streaming devices.  Just about any streaming device (gaming consoles, blu ray players and media boxes) offer many more options in terms of services). In addition alot of them are cheaper or at the same price of the apple tv3. The newer apple tv does has have a faster processor and more RAM than the previous version. The only way to get apps and more streaming services on your apple tv 3 is to use air play with either an iPad , iPhone or iPod touch. At this point there is no jailbreak available on the apple tv 3. I didn't notice a difference in performance on the newer apple tv 3. Also I personally didn't notice a difference in picture quality between my apple tv 2 and 3. If you already have an apple tv 2 then I don't think you need to upgrade to the newer one. Also if you are considering an apple tv at this time and don't have tv that is 46 inches or larger I would strongly recommend looking at getting a refurbished apple tv 2 for $69 directly from appple. I decided the return my apple tv 3 and just get the refurbished older model. It's cheaper, easier to jailbreak and still has the great features and interface.I still find the aplle tv 3 overpriced when compared to other streaming devices that it competes with. But for the air play functionality alone it makes a great accessory for the iPad , iPhone and iPod touch. Also the netlix interface is far suporior to any other device I've tried.

The TV has to compete with high levels of daytime ambient lighting and reflections. It does so admirably. The panel itself is not of the ""glossy"" type, which lends itself to reducing the reflections that some other displays ( notably plasmas with their glass surface ) have. In a perfect world, the Vizio would have a limited sheen bezel as well, but this is not the case. Piano black and very glossy.Connectability:  A full complement of connections are available and well thought out on this display. If you are going to connect any legacy equipment that requires analog connections you will not have the problem of running out of input jacks. (As a side note, be aware of the lower priced models. Vizio has ""dual purposed"" the component/composit jack pack making that connection an ""either/or"" situation.) A side jack pack is also available and is handy for temporary hookups.Ergonomics:  The remote is a classy little brick. The qwerty keyboard on the flip side proves to be very handy if you search frequently for various programming from your cable/sat provider or Netflix/Vudo or similar. My mother immediately said she would never use the keyboard until she found just how simple it is to use in comparison with the standard ""letter selection"" process normally found as your only option. Well done Vizio. I'd like to see some of the better universal programmable remotes have a qwerty keyboard as well.Side control options are poorly marked as usual, but since very rarely used, quite the norm.The stand has an interesting flaw. When properly connected to the panel itself, the display actually leans back a few degrees from vertical. Since LCD technology still requires us to be pretty much centered in front of the display, I found that I had to modify the stance with the effect of pointing the display to the sight line. Since the Vizio is even a touch fussier than some other makers in this regard, I was surprised at the lack of a swivel/tilt stand on this 3d capable display.Performance:  After making the connections and dialing in the built in wifi for the apps, a pleasantly simply procedure by the way, I immediately noticed the limited viewing angle issue mentioned before. Be aware of this if your seating configuration covers a wide area. Those outside of the somewhat limited ""sweet spot"" will not have the same viewing experience as the front and center crowd. If you are front and center although, a very nice bright image is viewed. The controls are all there if you wish to adjust for various lighting scenarios and as an ISF tech, I was pleased to see a full complement of drives and cuts to dial in the grayscale in the advanced user section. After setting the black and white level controls, I measured the contrast ratio at nearly 600 to one using the checkerboard ANSI pattern. Very decent for a ccfl LCD display. The primary and secondary color points were spot on and after dialing in the grayscale a bit, film DVD/BluRay viewing in a darkened room (evening in this case) proved the display to be quite capable. The 3D capability with the enclosed passive shades was not tested.Conclusion:  A lot of bang for the buck here. It is no wonder the once titans of tv's are scratching their heads. Vizio has a fine display here for a well lighted room with a casual viewer as the target market.d6500k ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3495, 3509)",1,0.0,False

No annoying reflections from lights in the room.The USB ports are a nice feature.  Not sure if I will use them, but I like having the option.Finally, the price on this monitor is rock-bottom for something of its caliber.  It isn't a touch screen, and won't bedazzle your desk with its style, but it appears to be a solid workhorse that won't get in your way.

The review has been accurate in my case and I have seen an improvement in both range and performance over my previous WRT 350N  router.On the downside like many reviews I read I found the firmware to be unstable.  That is within the first 24 hours the router had dropped all the wireless connections in the house and devices were not able to connect consistently.  Having read many reviews and some forums I knew this was a possibility but I also new that I had options.  There are 3 alternative firmware versions available that will all work on this router so if the stock asus firmware is not fitting the bill you have a choice of Merlin, Tomato or DD-WRT.  At this point however a simple update to the latest Asus firmware resolve my problem and the router has been stable since that time.There are some other things I do not like about the Asus software:Parental Controls - The only option here is to set a calendar of access times.  The Web 2.0 interface is awkward and you must set a different schedule for each MAC address.  I found it time consuming and problematic.  I would have preferred to create an access class assign the schedule to the access class and then assign the MAC address to the class.  But at least I was able to disable WIFI during nighttime hours so my children aren't watching HULU or worse all night in bed.Static IP - While it gives you the ability to create leases, you cannot name them.  And as such the DNS from the router will not serve a name for them.  This has been a feature I have used for a while and has been available on every previous router that I have purchased.  It makes it easy to setup a static entry for my ReadyNAS, and networked Xerox printer and then access them in a browser by name instead of IP.  All of the alternative firmwares provide this capability so I will likely switch to one of them, going to try Merlin first as it has the best performance.QoS - I really don't get it, why would you invent your own version of QoS when a standard 802.11Q already exists and would make your device compliant with other devices that also support the standard such as my 24 port gigabit switch.  The lack of this feature has effectively nullified the capability on my 24 port switch as I have no congestion within the switch, only when accessing the internet.  Instead they provide a very dumbed down custom QoS implementation that has been very buggy by all reports.  I am hoping that I might be able to get 802.11q with DDWRT or Tomato, but doubt that Merlin will provide it.In general the interface is just simplified, and it is clear that it was intended for the novice user.  Some advanced features are available, but for the most part it is designed for the non-technical user.To be clear, I find the problems above endemic across all SOHO offerings.  They are adequate, but dumbed down for grandma to the point they do not work the way a technologist would expect.  Based on the performance I am seeing with update firmware, I can highly recommend this if you need a Dual Band WIFI router, I have deducted 1 star because you will need to flash the firmware to get it to be stable.

I received it a few days later. It was great timing because I was just getting ready to leave on a business trip. I rapidly removed it from the box.  My initial impression was great. Starting from the cool box to the wireless keyboard case. The case looks great. It feels very sturdy and nice looking.  It is little thicker than my old case (another great case from NewTrend Airbend 2.0 (NT510K)).Next, I had to charge the case to use it. I had only a few hours left before I left. Now the charging process is a little strange.  The manual says that the light indicator should be lighted in RED, but I never saw it. I waited and eventually the light turned BLUE  (maybe the RED indicator only shows when the battery is dead. I will have to post an update once the first charge is over).Then came it came to placing my iPad Air into the new case. I struggled a little. The case is very tight. It is harder to take it apart.  Putting it together was very easy once I figured out how to take it apart. Each of the important input places are protected by a small tab which fits perfectly and makes the iPad well protected.  The case comes with a screen protector which is nice (I already have my screen protector), but I figured it will provide a double protection.  Now I had everything ready for my trip.When I boarded my flight, I was finally ready to use it.  First I needed to open the case to the position that felt most comfortable. There is a release button in the on the side of the case that releases the extension arm.  I pulled it too far and it came apart.  It was no problem. Pressed the button and placed the extension arm to the right level.  Now, I was truly ready to use it, but before I use it I had to pair the wireless keyboard and my iPad Air (updated to the last iOS).  First, I could not figure out how to turn on the keyboard. I did not read the manual, but I eventually figured that I need to hold the on/off button for a few seconds to turn it on and off. Then I pressed the pairing button which connected easily to my iPad.  Used extensively the keyboard during my 10 hours flight. I wrote emails and made notes in preparations for my upcoming client meetings. The keyboard felt nice. It was not clunky and was a good size.  With my first Airbender 2.0, I had some problems with the keyboard freezing my iPad which this worked perfectly.  During my trip, the passenger next to me commented about the case too. He said it looks really nice.During the week and my flight back, the case was still working perfectly. So far, no problems. I took some pictures with iPhone 5s.

And what it basically comes down to is value.  I have never heard sound as good as these headphones in the $35 range, easily the best under $75.  I can't believe they're over 25 years old.It's hard to describe how much detail these headphones bring out without making it too harsh or dull.  I listen to every type of music from classical to hip hop to electronic to country, and these headphones are suitable for all types of music.  The only fault in the sound is the bass.

The sound is warm, mellow, and neutral, but it loses a lot of detail at the expense of these attributes.  I still prefer higher-detail Portapro, but some may prefer the more mellow sound of the PX100-II.Oh by the way the Portapro comes in the straight plug now, not the angled plug anymore.

The user interface (UI) installed on the Vizio E320i-A0 is Vizio's crippled Yahoo! TV Apps/M-GO interface, NOT the company's ""Vizio Internet Apps Plus"" interface.  It is clunky, frustrating, limited, and NOT user friendly.  While the TV is just fine as standard TV or monitor, and has a decent picture, adequate sound, and plenty of inputs, the UI is terrible and the remote is almost worthless.  It is not a good value as it comes at a premium over a similarly appointed HD set, and you can save nearly a C-note and a whole bunch of frustration if you simply buy a ""dumb"" 32-inch HD set and a Roku LT from Amazon.I purchased this TV in January 2013 on Vizio's promise that it would provide an outstanding Smart TV experience.  It was anything BUT outstanding.  Its primary app, ""M-GO"" (prominently displayed on both the unit's UI home screen and its lousy remote control), was billed as a ""revolutionary"" TV experience when I purchased the TV.  Bizarrely, M-GO wasn't installed on the TV at the time of purchase and didn't even become available for it until Summer 2013.  When it finally did arrive via Vizio's eventual firmware update, M-GO turned out to be all ""pay"" TV - no included content.  It was thoroughly disappointing and not ""revolutionary"" as promised.  I already have Netflix and Amazon Prime, so I don't need their lousy pay app.  Aside from M-GO, there are other apps available for the E320i-A0 -- some are preinstalled like Yahoo! Finance and Skype, but most are downloaded through the Yahoo! TV Apps store in the unit's poorly structured UI.  Strangely, Yahoo! TV Apps offers only a very limited number of apps for this ""smart"" TV -- a grand total of 134 (that's right:  ONLY ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR!) as of this writing on December 26, 2013 -- and most of them are either local news station apps from distant corners of the U.S., or paid anime/cartoon channels. Even the familiar apps like iHeart Radio have limited feature sets and don't offer the programmable, personalized channels you would customarily be able to set up on your computer or smart phone, but rather offer only a specified set of broadcast stations from select markets.

At first I thought the smaller flatter keys would make my typing a lot less accurate because its harder to feel out individual keys but I actually type a lot better on this keyboard! The F and J keys have raised bumps on them to help you find where you need to put your pointer fingers.  I love the full-sized backspace key (my old keyboard had a tiny one) but I wish it also had a raised bump on it to find it easier. The capslock key has a tiny green light to indicate it is active but the scroll and numlock keys do not have indicators.On the top of the keyboard are media keys - to adjust the volume on the right side, and play/forward/backward on the left side. The F keys double as hotkeys via the FN key next to the right-side alt. There are keys to open your browser, media player, and even restart your pc! On the right side there are even more useful keys! keys for going forward and backward in your browser, opening your bookmarks menu, and opening the calculator. the calculator key is really handy for me as I do my math homework online, and i love that it is right above the number pad!The keyboard is pretty big and has a ledge on the bottom to rest your wrists on I guess. My keyboard tray is a bit small so I would prefer if the keyboard did not have this ledge! I keep my keyboard at an angle and it is just inconvenient.

It fits very comfortably in my small hands. I've used it both right handed and left handed and its very ergonomic! It only runs well if you have it on a mousepad, which is my only complaint because with other mouses I've used they have worked fine without a mousepad on my keyboard tray. But on the mousepad it runs very smoothly and comfortably.Overall I think this is a great combo! I bought it at Fry's and there was a rebate, so I think I paid $30? for it.

The media button for going to the previous song got something sticky trapped around it so it is pretty much unusable. I have thrown this keyboard on the floor and across the room probably a thousand times. It falls off my keyboard tray onto my chair or the floor just about every time i get up.

I dubbed mine ""The iPod killer"". After fighting my old 3rd gen 8gb iPod nano for a few years. I decided enough was enough and I wanted something that I could use in whatever mannerism I wished to. So, i bought the 8gb clip+, a 16GB micro SD card and installed rockbox(a free third party firmware) onto the clip. I could not be happier with the results, people are constantly amazed when i tell them that i managed to build a 24GB mp3 player with custom firmware and in this size for only $75. It really can't be beat except for on battery life. However, I don't really see how you could ever kill the battery in one day and it would probably even be quite unlikely in two days. I charge mine and switch around music every few days without it ever dying on me.Pros-Portability-Clip-micro SD slot-High Capacity to begin with-ability to change firmwares and to use product as you wish (ex. click and drag files instead of using clunky programs)Cons- I can only think of one and that is the battery life. I could see the battery getting weak enough to where it might die within a long days use and that would be troublesome for me. But, as of right now I charge every few days and have no worries. I WILL update if i ever see any decline in battery life to the point of it bothering me.-I also would like to note that the text might prove kind of hard to see out of the box for people with any problems seeing smaller text. However, with the use of 3rd party firmware you can change the text to any size that you want. But, keep in mind it requires some effort to install the 3rd party firmware and even then the screen is still small, so larger text gets kind of cumbersome. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone with problems seeing, but on the other hand I can't really think of many media players that I would. Definitely nothing that is even close to the size of this device.Summary: All in all I couldn't have bought any device close to the capacity as this one for as much as I paid for the device and the SD card. Throw in the fact that it is so small and that I can put on whatever firmware I want and just drag and drop my files and I'm simply astounded by this product.

I might have appreciated a rubberized feel to the sides of this mouse rather than the textured hard plastic, but it's just as effective.This mouse lost a star due to a couple annoyances I have.First off, this does not use the Logitech universal receiver that the company uses for other wireless keyboards/mice. It's receiver polls at a much higher frequency. This paired with the fact that the mouse runs off of one AA NiMH battery, means the battery life is pretty abysmal; few hours at most. They've cleverly designed the charging cable to turn the mouse into a cabled variant which is convenient, but I now find myself almost exclusively using the mouse in this way rather than via wireless which defeats the purpose.Secondly, I lift my mouse off the mat while using it quite often. It's a habit I've had for 15 years or so. When I do that with this mouse, I almost always push one or two of the bottom thumb buttons. It's been enough of a problem that I've had to manually set these buttons to do nothing in games and the Logitech software (it would affect the DPI of the mouse).

The tablets I've owned that I could compare this one to included theHP TouchPad Wi-Fi 32 GB 9.7-Inch Tablet Computer, the original Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1,Apple iPad MD366LL/A (16GB, Wi-Fi + AT&T; 4G, Black) 3rd Generation,ASUS Transformer TF300 T-B1-BL 10.1-Inch 32 GB Tablet (Blue)(with matching dock), the aforementioned Nexus 7,Google Nexus 10 (Wi-Fi only, 16 GB), and myMicrosoft Surface (32GB).  The Nexus 7 has turned out to be a worthy addition to this collection.  Here's why.PROS+ Lightweight build.  Last year's Nexus 7 was hardly a slouch in this department, and was more than portable enough for most.  The iPad Mini (which I purchased as a gift) is slightly thinner, but it doesn't really make any drastic improvements.  This device is markedly lighter than both, which makes it surprisingly easier in the hands.  You wouldn't think there was much room for improvement here (given the first generation was quite nice), but ASUS managed to pull it off.+ Great, understated looks.  Sure, the top and bottom bezels are a little larger, but compared to last year's Nexus 7, this device has a lot more ""class"" to it.  The exterior bezels now lack the bright silver banding, which helps the screen melt away into the bezels.  That's all the better, since as an LCD panel (which won't achieve the same black-levels as a AMOLED display from Samsung) is the centerpiece of this device, it's best to keep your focus on it.  The back is nice and smooth, with the word ""NEXUS"" inscribed into the back.  The branding is non-obtrusive and otherwise non-existent on a device that all around has a sophisticated, matte look to it.+ Powerful performance.  Without getting into too much technical information, the processor in this device (a rebranded Qualcomm Snapdragon 600) is significantly more powerful than the Nexus 7's Tegra 3 in every way.  It's also more power efficient, so you can watch your movies and games for longer, all while enjoying stunning looks.  Which brings me to the next two points...+ Beautiful screen.  This is a Full HD (1080p) panel in a 7"" package.  The best effort prior to this was Amazon's own Kindle Fire HD 8.9, which had a 1080p panel as well.  At present, this device has the sharpest screen (in terms of PPI) of any device, even compared against Apple's iPad 3 and Samsung's Nexus 10.  Colors are sharp and vivid and the screen has no motion blurring or ghosting.  My unit also doesn't have any light bleed, although I've seen some people complaining about it.+ Better hardware for longevity.  You may have heard of the recent kerfuffles around last year's Nexus 7, which has started to slow down and lag for many users.  The problem lay in how the device managed its onboard storage-- which, to put it mildly, was poor.  If you didn't mind tinkering and rooting your device, you could fix the issue, but that should never be a requirement in a consumer product.  Luckily enough, the refresh's hardware boasts better memory and Android 4.3 will automatically keep things in good shape, so you won't have to worry about this.+ Sound is pretty good for a small device.  It gets plenty loud without much distortion.  Unfortunately, ASUS elected to keep the speakers on the back for some unknown reason (especially with nice bezels on the top and bottom that could have provided stereo in landscape-- which is where you'd need those speakers most).  This is especially perplexing considering how well-reviewed the speakers on the Nexus 10 and HTC One were-- both packed front-facing stereo speakers.+ Android 4.3 under the hood means you've got a faster, more secure mobile experience than any previous version.  Even if you're primarily an iOS user, the Nexus 7 is definitely worth a look.  The Play Store's got almost all the heavy hitters you'd use on a tablet (such as Amazon Kindle, Netflix, a YouTube experience second to none, and the full power of Google's own services as an example), as well as some amazing Android-exclusive apps (such as Press, a beautiful RSS reader for those who prefer to take their news this way).  Many people have griped in the past about Android and tablet apps, but...+ You'll also find a mature and solid ecosystem waiting for you.  As a 7"" device, the refreshed Nexus 7 sits between traditional 10""-class tablets and the smartphone, meaning it can use apps designed for either very well.  Although most Android apps are still designed for phones, they scale up very well on the Nexus 7 (nothing like Apple's frankly laughable 2x zoom mode available on the iPad/iPad Mini).  Android tablet apps are also getting better by the day, so unless there really is that one killer app you can't leave behind, give it a whirl!+ Android 4.3 also provides multiuser support, so if you have this tablet in any social settings (having friends over, throwing a party, and so on), you can easily set up a guest profile for friends to use while keeping your own stuff under lock and key.  It's also great as a family tablet-- share the device among multiple members while keeping everyone's stuff separate.  Things have also gotten a lot faster since the 4.2 days, so if you had any issues before, give it another go.+ Notification light!  Hoorah!  Long-time Android users will instantly recognize how useful these things are, and as a casual device to leave lying around your desk, the light makes things much better.  Let's say you're walking by a coffee table and you receive an e-mail.  With an iOS device, the screen will light up for a few seconds, and a pulsing icon will let you know that you've got a message of some sort.  And both iOS and Android handsets without a light (such as last year's Nexus 7) will beep or produce a tone to let you know the same.  But if you happen to walk by after those time out, you'd never know that you have something waiting for you.  With a notification light, you get a persistent, unobtrusive and instantly-visible way of seeing that something's waiting.+ Great battery life.  Although the battery's smaller than last year's Nexus 7 (probably to slim down the build), Android 4.3 and the newer Snapdragon processor make for quite a powerful (hehe) package that will run all day and then some without trouble.  I have yet to charge mine after receiving it two days back, and I'm still looking at 50% remaining after heavy use.Of course, this isn't all sunshine and daisies.  Make sure you're making an informed purchase.  Here are some cons I've noticed.CONS- The cameras are forgettable.  Good enough for video calling, but it won't even replace most smartphone cameras.- I'm having screen lift issues in the upper left hand-hand side of my tablet, which means the back creaks a little if I press on it.  It doesn't impact functionality at all, and hopefully it may go away after a while, but my launch-day 8GB Nexus 7 from last year also had this issue.  needless to say, I'm a little annoyed that they weren't more rigorous this time around.  Not something you should have to deal with as a consumer.- Top and bottom bezels make the device a little larger than it has to be.  Depending on how you use this device, it could actually be a major pro for you (as wider bezels give you a better surface to grip without accidentally touching the screen).  For me, it's a definite con, since I think it makes the device look a tad silly.- Slightly less grippy than last year's model.  The refresh loses the dimpled texture of the original, which makes it a little more ""slick"" in the hand.  It's not awful by any means, but do keep in mind that it can slide a little more on surface than you'd expect.- The buttons.  Are maddening.  They're basically flush with the chassis, and while there's solid feedback on all three (power, volume up, volume down), they're very close to one another and feel exactly the same.  Expect to hit volume up a lot trying to wake this device up.All in all, I'd say buy this one with confidence.  It's well worth the upgrade if you're on the fence, and if you're new to the Android tablet land, this is an amazing place to start.

It didn't set up very fast and took a number of tries to get the macros right for turning on the TV and switching input devices, but once it was set it's been great.  My kids are 12 and 15 and are thankful for the remote.  They don't have to ask for my help to play video games or watch a DVD anymore.A few particular features I like about the remote:1. The keys for the most part are backlit and when you move the remote the display and backlight are activated, you don't have to push a button.2. It is rechargable.  I hate having to replace batteries every few months.  It lasts almost a week on one charge... but I put it on the charger after about 3 or 4 days.  I don't want to chance being without this baby.3. It will learn commands from my other remotes.  This was very helpful when setting up the macro for switching TV inputs.  Even tho I put the TV make and model in it didn't know how to switch from SAT input to DVD input without a little learning.  This all depends on your TV.  Mine is a Mitsubishi WD-65733.  I also had to tell it what the inputs were called and which ones were listed in what order.  Beware... I think it was case sensitive in setup.4.  If you want to go into the advanced features of one of your devices without using the macros to do what you want to do you can still do that.  Just a double click of a button and you can set the surround sound on your stereo receiver or modify the night display on your DVD player... and so on.5.  It controlls my HD DVR from DirectTV so I can still FWD,RWD, pause, and record without any problems.  It does everything the remote for the device did.6.  You can upload your own photos to the remote and set them as the background in the display.What I don't like???There are really only two things I would change about it and that's the feel of the buttons and the ease of setup.  Some buttons are very small and they're hard plastic.  Some remotes have the nice big rubber buttons and for some people they really like those.  I don't know how you could make it easier but I did have to get it to learn a few commands from my TV remote.  Some people just aren't into computers and electronics much and could get frustrated by this.Over all, this is one sweet remote.  My friends are jealous when they come over.

A pair I bought at Radio Shack 5 years ago for $27 (bedroom), which died and is the reason for my purchase.  I also have the Sony headphones for $150 (TV room).  These cost $75 (bedroom).

One day, I was just looking for a new Blu-ray player that had the Netflix capability and Wi-Fi and I came across the Panasonic DMP-BDT210P which also is 3D.  I don't have a 3D capable TV as yet, but I bought this one with the future in mind...baby steps.  I had no idea what to do about making the Netflix work, but research told me I needed a router.  I'd focused on Cisco routers, but this day, in reading the reviews I decided to look at other routers and I spotted this one and read some of the reviews on it and decided to try this one.  What impressed me the most was the reviewers experience with Medialink contact support. How willing their support group is to ACTUALLY HELP YOU.  I've been so sick of fighting with support personnel on other products purchased.My new blu-ray player and Medialink Wireless N Router arrived the same day.  I'm an older person.  I read the little instruction packet that came with the Medialink router, but I was still scared to try to follow the instructions. There are two little pamphlets one for IF you have a DSL modem, and one for IF you DO NOT have a DSL modem. I determined my modem is a DSL modem.  I re-read the next day.  I asked around at work about setting up a router.  I re-read the instructions AGAIN.  Then one day, I just said, I can do this!  There are 12 sections of info to follow.  My computer is NOT WIRELESS, and that was my biggest concern.  I got through the steps and was confused about WIRED VS WIRELESS.  In one part of the instruction you have the option to change your SSID, I was afraid to because I thought you would have to go through the whole thing again, so at the time I set this router up, I did not originally change the SSID, one of my co-workers told me to DEFINATELY change your passphrase from the products generic passphrase.  That part I did do.You get to the end of it, and I found something about removing the network cables which appears in the instructions on the CD that comes with it, but I don't see it in the instructions on the pamphlet insert for DSL modems. I viewed the CD only after I'd set the router up, and found that the CD has more DETAILED INSTRUCTION on installing.  Anyway, this instruction tells you that you can remove these two network cables after you have set up your router and that is where I freaked out because logic told me that if my computer is NOT WIRELESS in the first place, I cannot remove these network cables without consequences.  So, I didn't do it.  It was after Meidalink hours, when I finished my set up of this router, so I decided to leave the cables plugged and call Medialink the next day to find out what I should do.I called and explained that I was not sure if I'd installed it properly and I had a female representative, and she was very nice and very patient, and she walked me through the ENTIRE steps of setting this up and found that I'd done everything correctly and she told me that changing the SSID to whatever I wanted didn't make me have to go through any other steps and she took me to that part of the installation to change it.  She also told me that I was CORRECT that you DO NOT REMOVE THE NETWORK CABLES from the back of the router and your computer IF YOUR COMPUTER IS NOT WIRELESS.  I was relived that I had not removed them.  She offered to help me set my other wireless items while she was on the phone, but I had not yet connected the Panasonic Blu-ray, and my printer required me to have the disc which I had to find.  Anyway, she told me that if I needed help installing anything I could call and receive help.I got off the phone, was able to connect the printer, and then I connected the Panasonic and it was the simplest thing I could ever have done.  All I had to do was click on Wired or Wireless during the EASY SETUP, and I chose Wireless, and it brought up two networks, one was mine, and one was someone else's, and I chose mine, and it asked for ENCRYTION KEY and I freaked out again because I didn't know what that meant.  This is the problem with technology, there are a multitude of TERMS that mean the same thing.  After several minutes, it dawned on me that they wanted me to put in my passphrase to access my network.  And I did that and it was done.I normally watch Netflix live on my computer, but now for the first time, thanks to my new Medialink Wireless N router, I watched my first Netflix from the big screen TV and I can't stop smiling about it!Another thing, I'd like to mention, I DID NOT have to move the Medialink around the room or adjust it or anything at all.  I've heard people complain about having to deal with those antenna type routers during certain conditions.  I'd wondered if I'd have go back and buy other gadgets to improve my signal, but so far, it is not necessary.I want to say to anyone who is looking to buy this item, it is a great product.  I DID NOT USE THE INSTALLATION CD to install it.  I just followed the 12 steps of information.  When you get to step 8 you are given the option to move on to step 9 or to pop in the CD.  For some reason the word (recommended) made me choose to proceed to step 9, and it all turned out perfectly.  So they are telling you the truth that you don't really need the installation CD to set this up, and I think that if your computer is WIRELESS you wouldn't keep the network cords but if your computer is like mine, and it you didn't buy it WIRELESS, you need to leave the network cords attached.Medialink - Wireless N Router - 802.11n - 150 Mbps - 2.4 Ghz - NEW Design w/ Internal Antenna ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(5678, 5692)",5,0.0,False

For the price, especially if you got in when they had the Netflix deal, this was almost impossible to pass up. Now, I'm a bit of a tech guy and have a computer plugged into every TV in my house, but this is still great for sharing YouTube and Netflix videos to the big screen without having to go switch inputs and grab my keyboard. I like the CEC support to turn on and change the input of your TV automatically the most.I can only give 4 stars out of 5 though because while the product is fantastic and the price is right, it still hasn't been adopted by many other apps than the initial few. Hulu recently added support, but Google has been fairly quiet about the product since announcing it. Still, even if you just used it for YouTube, Netflix, and/or Hulu, it's so cheap it's still a great buy. I'd really like to see Google use this technology more though and it would be worth a full 5 stars.For those comparing with Apple TV or Airplay, I don't see any reason for these products to co-exist as they do very similar tasks. The difference though is that using Airplay requires you to buy an Apple TV at minimum which is a good bit more expensive. Simply put though, if you're an Apple person with a lot of Apple products, you may be happier with an Apple TV using Airplay. Otherwise, this cheaper alternative can perform similarly if not even better once Google and other companies (hopefully) start to utilize it more.

The Astro E5 size is exactly the same size as it predecessor, the Astro E4. The weight of it is pretty heavy holding it in your hand but not anything that is noticeable if you have a bunch of stuff in a bag with this battery in it. The on/off button is quite easy to press and easily pressed if it is stuffed into a bag. The flashlight in the external battery is a big plus. It is a bright LED light that works well if the power is out or looking for something in the night. The light is easily turned on because of the easily pressed on/off buttons. The flashlight is activated by pressing 2 times fast on the on/off button. This battery has 2 USB ports. One is 5 volts at 2 amps and the other is 5 volts at 1 amp. There are 4 LED's that tell how much power the battery pack has left for charging other devices. The battery has a smooth, shiny, reflective and stylish finish which looks awesome. The finish on the battery also attractions a lot of fingerprints which could make the battery look bad if not cleaned every so often.This battery has a massive 15000mah lithium ion battery in it that is packed in a small casing. This battery is smaller than most other external batteries I have researched in the past which is ideal for packing in a small bag. I use this battery to charge my iPhone 5 and my iPod touch 5. I can charge both these devices simultaneously.This product is ideal for someone who travels a lot and uses a smartphone for their business when traveling. This battery is also good for people who go camping and are not around power that watch movies and play games on their device for long periods of time. Other than the buttons being easily pressed this is the perfect external battery for those looking into buying one to use for a long trip or power your friends device and keep your devices charged in case of a black out.The Anker Astro E5 is closely comparable to the Astro E4.Anker Astro E4 13000mAh External Battery Pack Portable Power Bank Charger for iPhone 5, 4S, 4, iPad 4, 3, 2, Mini, iPods; Samsung Galaxy S4, S3, S2, Note 2; HTC One, EVO, Thunderbolt, Incredible, Droid DNA; Motorola ATRIX, Droid; Google Nexus 4, Nexus 7... (This has a 13000mah lithium ion battery) Both of these batteries look identical from the looks to the locations of the ports but the Astro E5 has a 15000mah battery that puts it over the top of the Astro E4.Overall the Anker Astro E5 is a great external battery that can charge your smartphone to 100% and do it again 6-8 more times and has a modern look most smartphones have today. You won't have to worry about your phone dying for more than a week when using this external battery.So far i have charged my iPhone 5 twice and it still has 4 LEDS.Another Update: i have charged my ipod touch 2 times and my iPhone 5 3 times and it now has 1 LED and can still charge my devices.I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest.

Setup was quick and easy. Getting my browser to work with it took a little more fiddling, but that's just because I didn't want my work email associated with my youtube etc... nevermind. Anyway, Chromecast works basically as promised. It's sort of neat that I can pull up a youtube video on my phone or tablet or computer and get it playing on my big screen.It was apparent right away though that the image was cropped on my screen. I'm running a 1080p stream to a 1080p screen, and don't have this issue with my PS3, Xbox, Blu Ray player, or Boxee or Roku. I streamed my screen as well, and sure enough it wasn't a true representation of my laptop screen. Didn't matter what I streamed from either - I tried doing so from my phone, and the youtube video was cropped on all sides - looked zoomed in. I played around with my tv settings, and it didn't fix the issue. There's no settings to be found for fixing it either.Even zoomed in, it was a nice quick way to send youtube to my tv (even though I have other methods) - it's easily the fastest way considering the time it takes to fire up other devices. Hulu was also zoomed in, and the performance was choppy. I noticed I had to have the video playing in my laptop at the same time and I couldn't close the lid on my laptop. If I went full screen, Hulu would show full screen on my tv, but I couldn't do anything else with my laptop. The video on my laptop was not synced with the video on the screen. So if I want to watch hulu and do other stuff with my laptop, I have to watch it in the browser window which you can see on the tv screen rather than full screen. Full screen crops the video anyway though like I said, so there's really no good way to watch hulu I don't think. Unless I'm missing something.Netflix had the same issue as Hulu with the cropping and full screen. Youtube didn't have the full screen issue where I couldn't do anything else with my laptop... just the cropping.This is a decent little device for the price, but I probably won't use it for much besides youtube streaming. I'd say for what it costs, if you plan to only use it to stream Youtube, it's worth the money. Otherwise, save your hdmi port for something better. If I had a time machine, I would probably not buy it again since I don't really need it. In fact, I may relegate it to the bedroom tv that never really gets used.

Read ""Update"" at the bottom of this article.Fit and finish is great.  Fits on my D700 without issue and looks like it was made for it.  Controls work fine.  The Zeikos has a rubberized finish where you would grip it for portrait shots, which looks and feels just like the rubber on the D700.  Ergonomically it's very nice.  My only ergonomic issue is not with the grip, it's with the camera strap which tends to obscure the viewfinder when you turn the camera vertically.  But this would be an issue with the MB-D10 also.The holder for the EN-EL3 is flimsy; be very careful inserting and removing the battery in the plastic holder.  I don't know if it's possible to buy the holder separately if it breaks.  I don't want to find out.When using the AA battery pack, the Nikon D700 will fire at its maximum frame rate, which it won't do with the EN-EL3.  This is why I bought the product as I take a lot of action shots.The problem is, after using the AA battery pack for a few minutes, the D700 will throw an error and refuse to fire.  I get the same results using fresh non-rechargeables and freshly charged rechargeables.  So far I've been able to fix the issue by turning off the camera, removing the battery pack, removing the camera's battery, wait a few seconds, then reinsert the camera battery.  I had read that this product can fry your camera's electronics, which I believe is FUD by those who want to sell you the much more expensive Nikon MB-D10.  But it is disturbing that the camera errors when using the AA adapter.  I have not yet had an error when using the EN-EL3.This feature (using AA batteries and getting the faster cycle time) was highly desired but doesn't appear to be working.  Had this worked, the product would have gotten a higher score.I've heard that this grip will work with the en-el4a, but the cost of the battery (plus cover and battery charger) is so prohibitive that I've declined to do the experiment.Update:I'm changing my rating to 4 stars.  I'd change it to 5 stars if Zeikos releases an en-el4 end cap that exactly fits the grip.  (See below.)As mentioned in a reply to this article, I got it working with the AA battery pack by changing a setting in the camera.  You have to tell the camera what kind of AA batteries are in the grip.  I'm currently using Sony 2500 mAh ""CycleEnergy"" rechargeables, and they work fine, at the full 8 fps of which the D700 is capable.  I take action shots at horse shows, usually 700 -- 800 shots per show, mostly at full continuous speed, and a fully charged set of AAs will lose just one bar off the power meter after a day of shooting.  I've also noticed that the Sonys keep their charge at least as long as the Nikon batteries do.  I always charge up before a pro shoot, but for casual use I don't bother, and the batteries don't appreciably lose charge sitting in the bag.After four months of hard use, I've had absolutely no problems with this grip.  The rubber coating has not peeled off, there are no cracks or other stress signs, and the grip still attaches solidly to the camera.  I've used it handheld and mounted on a tripod with no problems.  It's been so convenient that I leave it on the camera.  (Which tells me I should have gotten a D3s instead of a D700 but that's another story.)I did finally spring for the en-el4 battery pack and the official Nikon endcap.  The battery pack works fine in the grip.  As others have noticed, the official Nikon end cap for the en-el4 does not fit exactly right on the grip.  There's a small gap in one spot.  It doesn't affect operation, and it's nowhere near your hand, but I would be concerned about weather sealing.  I'll use it in dry weather but will probably go back to the Zeikos battery pack when I have to shoot in inclement weather.  It's too bad Zeikos doesn't make an end cap that fits properly on this grip.  I'd buy one.I haven't done a lot of shooting yet with the en-el4, but a few tests show that I still get full continuous speed and the camera works flawlessly.Second update:I've owned this device 18 months now.  I thought I'd be taking it on and off the camera depending on whether I needed the vertical shutter, extra battery capacity or faster frame rate.  In practice, I keep the grip on the camera all the time.  It gives the camera a more solid feel, and I use the vertical controls a lot more than I thought I would.I now have two EN-EL4a batteries, and have had no problems using them in the grip.  I keep the AA adapter in my bag in case of emergency, but haven't needed in a long time.I shoot mostly action in outdoor settings, and my camera tends to see hard use.  The D700 has scars from being dropped, has part of the paint rubbed off from use, and the rubber on the body is starting to peel away in one spot.  You'd think this Chinese made knock-off grip would look even worse, but it is so far showing no significant signs of wear.  The rubber is still firmly attached, nothing has rubbed off with use and all the controls still work.I was a little anxious about buying this because of rumors that it would ""fry your camera"" or wouldn't hold up to field work, but I now have to admit, this is probably the best sixty bucks I have spent in a long time.  Here's hoping Zeikos manages to keep up this level of quality.Third update:I've had this grip for two years now.  It's rarely off the camera, and has seen heavy use with Nikon EN-EL4 battery packs.  (About 20,000 clicks during this time.)  It has taken a lot of abuse, including falling out of the car, and still works fine.  The only oddity I have noticed is that rarely (about five times in six months) the shutter release on the grip will stop working.  I *think* this happens when I swap batteries, but I haven't characterized the problem yet, mostly because it happens so rarely.  Turning the camera off, waiting a few seconds, and turning it back on, solves the problem.  My current theory is that it happens when I forget to turn off the power when swapping batteries, but don't know for sure yet.  Will update again if I find the root cause.I'm still really happy with this product.  I shoot in portrait mode a lot, and the vertical grip is very comfortable.  The build quality is excellent.

It's a surprisingly limited class, given current trends in home theaters and media consumption. I've listed another contender, below.First, note that I have the white K400R. The R indicates the updated keyboard, with some reprogrammable features, and which has volume controls on the F10-F12 keys. The older K400 has volume controls on the hotkey buttons, above. At this writing, Amazon offers either black or white versions of the keyboard, BUT, the black one is the K400, and the white one is the K400R.The keyboard layout is not full-sized. It's just a bit larger than the one on my Asus EeePC netbook. I have no problem with this size, though some users may find it too small. Some have complained about the stretch required to get to the right shift key. While it IS a stretch, the smaller overall size of the keyboard makes the stretch not as bad as it may appear. Keystroke feel is pretty good. Build quality is pretty good. You get some minor creaks when picking it up in various ways, but, picking it up with one hand -- thumb under the touchpad -- is solid enough.For me, a keyboard that lacks dedicated Page Up, Page Down, Home and End keys is a non-starter. For that reason, I had always avoided the K400. I decided to give the K400R a try, when I learned that it is ""programmable."" Well, it is sort of programmable: 3 hotkey buttons (media player, PC lock, PC sleep) and 6 function keys (F1-F6) can be reconfigured with Logitech's downloadable Setpoint software. Note that the Home button can NOT be reassigned.I set up the F1 and F2 keys as Page Up and Page Down. The F3 and F4 keys became Home and End. To help identify their function, I put thin strips of colored electrical tape on the button risers (I'll try to add a photo). [Unfortunately, these new navigation keys do not work with the control or shift key, such as when selecting text.] I set F5 to be WMC toggle between full-screen and window mode. F6 is set to be quick skip (aka skip ahead, aka ad skip).When Googling for keystrokes necessary to program F5 and F6, I discovered two things about Windows Media Center. 1) There are keyboard shortcuts available for all operations we might want to accomplish with dedicated media keys. Nice. You could actually live without a ""media keyboard,"" if you don't mind using the control- and alt- shifted keystrokes. 2) The quick skip interval can be modified with the skipaheadinterval registry setting (exercise caution; and, Google for full instructions). Instead of the default 30 seconds, skipping ads in recorded programs might be easier if set to skip 60 seconds, or even 3 minutes.The next issue some people have expressed with this keyboard is that the FN key must be pressed to get regular F1-F12 keystokes, since the media and windows functions have been set for non-FN priority. Fortunately, this can be reversed in Setpoint. BTW, Setpoint may not immediately offer configuration options on new setups. It seems you must first use the software to unpair and then re-establish connection (using another keyboard or mouse), before all options are shown.In spite of my tendency to frequently use the F5 and F11 keys, I decided to maintain priority for the media keys. To avoid having to FN shift for F5 and F11, I set the PC lock and PC sleep buttons to provide those functions.The touchpad has a good feel for general use and 2-finger scroll. Pinch-zoom works, but, I've never had that before, so can't compare feel.There are 2 significant problems with the touchpad, which I have decided to live with. They are known issues, as they have appeared in problem reports on the Logitech support forum. 1) The 2-finger right-click often does not work. It appears to vary depending on window focus, or use of 2-finger scroll. It's so bad, I'd rather use my thumb on the right mouse button, below the touchpad. 2) While double-tap-drag does work for some things, like moving a window by the title bar, it does NOT work to resize a window. Resizing becomes a 2-hand operation, though the left mouse button on the top left corner makes it less awkward than if using the touchpad's left button.Some users might find happiness with the Ortek WKB-2000, currently listed on Amazon as ""2.4GHz RF Wireless Keyboard with Smart Touchpad Mouse for MCE Media Center Edition"". I could not get the 2-finger scroll to work. From reading reviews, and through my own efforts, I discovered there is no good driver for Windows 7, 64-bit.The best keyboard I've had is listed on Amazon as ""RK728 Wireless Keyboard"". Mine just died, and it was a great loss! Unfortunately, it is not currently available, even on the 'bay. That may be because of quality control problems. I knew mine would not last forever, and had tried twice to buy a backup. But, both failed in a few days, and were returned.Also noteworthy, is the Adesso WKB-4000UB. It has a great form factor, good key action, and is currently available, but, it has no media keys. Worse than that, the touchpad seems to be pretty low resolution, and, about half the time, tap to click does not register, so, I have to move the pointer slightly, and tap again. For that reason, I just use it as a backup. Mine is several years old, so, it is possible that the touchpad has been improved. Oh, and the touchpad has a scroll zone on the right edge, rather than 2-finger scroll.3 1/2 stars would be the best rating for the K400R. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(5554, 5568)",5,0.0,False

I am using it with an ipad 2. I purchased it after I was happy with two other iPad keyboard purchases. The Airbender is lime having three accessories in one. First it functions as a keyboard, second as a case; and third as a stand. The nearly unlimited amount of positions the keyboard/case can be configured is awesome. The entire Keyboard can be separated from the iPad half of the case which is perfect for users that desire a little more distance between the two. The iPad can be used independent of the keyboard while still retaining half the case to protect the bottom and sides. It uses a pinch lock mechanism to quickly unsnap it. Other keyboard case solution areMuch more tedious. The keyboard has worked flawlessly since purchase. It was extremely easy to pair with the iPad. Feedback on the keys is excellent. Much better than those keyboards with the soft rubbery feel. The keyboard is also larger then most iPad keyboard which makes using it much, much easier for people like me with large hands. I charged the case once and 8 days later and its still working off the initial charge. I have no doubt that it will stay charged for weeks or months. Another great feature is the Airbender functions as a stand and can be configured in portrait mode for typing documents or landscape mode for games and movies. The case also shuts off the iPad when closed with the magnetic switch. The case looks great open or closed. I brought it to work and had several people asking me about it and where I got it. It has a very cool functional design. The iPad is held securely in place and all ports and switches are easy accessible. I highly recommend this keyboard/case combination.

Lost interest in the hobby for a long time, then got back into it in 2009.  Wow, have things changed!  I have been using a Panasonic LX3 since December 2009 with very good results (fast Leica glass on the LX3) and was ready to get back into an interchangeable lens camera.  After doing a lot of hands on research, I decided on the D3100.I've had mine for two weeks now and for the most part, I am impressed.  The D3100 takes excellent images on automatic with the kit lens.  Composition is much easier with a proper viewfinder and the larger sensor makes obtaining shallow depth of field simple.  My semi-pro photographer friends have all commented that my images with the D3100 are more creative, more artistic and much better than with the LX3.Personally, I can see the enhanced creativity in my D3100 images but I feel there is little difference in image quality between the two cameras.  A bit of a disappointment on that regard (I was hoping for sharper images)  but others who have viewed my images disagree with me, so maybe I am being overly critical.  One thing I have discovered is the D3100's abilities far exceed mine when I take it off automatic - in other words, there is a steep learning curve going manual on this camera.  I have a lot to learn about exposure so I feel that the D3100 will be a great tool to help me enhance my photographic skills.I am a bit disappointed in the build quality - the SD card door is flimsy and moves around a bit when closed, the lens creaks.  The all metal LX3 has much better build quality than the D3100.  To be fair, the D3100 has better build quality than the Canons I tested.The D3100 feels great in my hands and is very nice to use.  The ergonomics are perfect.  I tested the D5100 and the D90 as well as all the Canon Rebels.  Of all of them, the D3100 felt the best.I considered getting the D5100 for its better sensor and screen, but the actual real world price difference was $400  (D5100 was being sold above sticker, D3100 was sold to me with a $100 Nikon rebate and an additional 10% discount from the retailer) and that was a significant savings.The 230k screen is adequate, not great, but acceptable.Overall, I am pleased.  I am looking forward to learning how to get the most out of this camera and I definitely feel it will help me grow as a photographer.Update, 6/1/11:  After reading Bryan Peterson's ""Understanding Exposure"", I am now shooting on full manual controls with my D3100.  I set shutter speed, aperture, ISO and white balance for every shot.  I also purchased the superb Nikkor 35mm f1.8 prime lens and a Tamron 70-300 telephoto zoom lens.  With my newly acquired knowledge about setting exposure, the images I am taking with the D3100 are excellent.  Images taken with the prime lens are tack sharp, that lens is amazing.  The Tamron set to 70 mm also takes sharp images (images taken with the Tamron at 70 mm are sharper than the kit lens and the Tamron does not get soft until 300mm).  With just a little post processing (I am using the View NX software that came with the camera), I can get the images from the kit lens to look incredible.  I am extremely satisfied with this camera and I highly recommend it. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3269, 3283)",1,0.0,False

When the Nexus 4 came out I decided to give it a shot and I loved it. I started using my iPad less and less because I enjoyed Android so much. Getting an Android tablet was next on my list, but I really wanted to wait for the 2013 Nexus 7 before trying it out. Once the Nexus 7 was announced, I quickly ordered one.The very first thing I noticed when taking it out of the box was its weight, or lack of. This thing is amazingly light and amazingly thin. Of course, the whole &#34;lighter and thinner&#34; quote is often said by Apple, but it can be easily applied to the new Nexus 7.Of course, the screen is another great thing about it. The 323 ppi is just 3 ppi short of the retina display on the iPhone. And for a device that will typically be held further away than a 4&#34; screen, this display is fantastic. It can be extremely bright and colors look fairly good so far. Viewing angles are pretty good. But my biggest complaint about the screen is how glossy it is. I would love to see more manufacturers start to implement the same kind of anti-glare glass that was put on the RMBP. Of course, this is dependent on Gorilla Glass, but hopefully they will start trying to decrease glare. Also, fingerprints get pretty obvious after a fair amount of use. But that is to be expected. The back of the device also seems to enjoy fingerprints. But this doesn't bother me on the back. And the back of the device has a nice finish to it making it comfortable to hold.The weight, size, and resolution of the Nexus 7 makes it a fantastic eReader. However, when it comes to web browsing the screen does feel small. This makes me wish it was a Nexus 8 instead of a Nexus 7, but I guess that could have increased the price. This is one area where I think Apple did a great job. Just a 1&#34; difference really does a lot to improve overall user experience when browsing the web. Sure, you can argue resolution, ppi, and throw all sorts of small numbers at the iPad Mini to make it look awful in comparison. But the screen size and aspect ratio really make it a great device for browsing the web and reading.When it comes to movies, the Nexus 7 is great. Although the 16:10 aspect ratio means you will still see black bars on the top and bottom on nearly every movie you watch. But the sound coming from the Nexus 7 is amazing. Google and Asus did a great job with dual speakers. However, in landscape mode the speakers are right where you are going to put your hands. So you may end up muffling the sound a little bit. The front bezels would have made a much better spot to put the speakers. Then they would have at least had some sort of excuse for the Texas-sized bezels. In fact, I watched a review online and the new Nexus 7 is taller than the old one. Meaning the top and bottom bezels are slightly bigger than last year!The simulated surround sound is a nice addition. And music sounds great. With movies, I have them all on Plex. So I am not sure how the Nexus 7 handles audio playback through Plex when watching a movie. And I know this may never happen, but it would be great if Google could do what they did with Google Music to personal movie collections. Obviously they would be worried about pirated movies. But I have a lot of DVDs that I got on my computer using HandBrake. And having that kind of functionality would be great. But I'm not holding my breath.The cameras seem to be decent. I have not tested them extensively yet, but for a tablet all you really need cameras for are for video chatting. And every video chat service will have to decrease the quality for streaming anyways.Wireless charging is a cool addition. It seems to work with my Nexus 4 wireless charger. However, I am still not a fan of Qi charging. Calling it wireless is just deceptive. Are wires still involved? Yes. Thus, not wireless. Plus using it on a wireless charger makes it much more difficult to use while the device is charging. If I have my Nexus 7 plugged into the cable, I can still play games that use the accelerometer. Can't easily do that with a wireless charger. Plus wireless chargers take longer to completely charge the device.Battery life is hard to determine at the moment since I just got it. I will need to update this section when I have more time with the device.Now that I have used it a full day, battery life isn't as good as I had hoped. Not even close really. I will post screen shots.The 2GB RAM and S4 Pro help the Nexus 7 feel speedy. However, it is still not perfectly smooth. Some parts of the UI will encounter some hiccups every now and then. Specifically dealing with the recent apps button and in some cases the home button freezing for a second or two. Nothing major, but this device still encounters minor lag.I find it odd that there is no vibrator motor in the Nexus 7. Sure, it may not be a priority, but adding one couldn't cost too much.Now that I have gone over the hardware, time to touch on the software. Android 4.3 is a minor update, and maybe it should have just been 4.2.3.Tablet app selection is still far inferior to iPads. Although, the Nexus 7 feels less like a tablet and more like a large phone. I'm not really sure how to explain this part, but is just doesn't feel like a tablet. Of course, 7&#34; is considered the smallest size screen a tablet can be, so I guess that makes sense. But when you have 5&#34; phones, 10&#34; tablets, and then a device with a 7&#34; screen, the screen size is closer to phones than tablets.Most apps work fine and are the exact same as the phone app, just scaled up. Some of the default Google Apps, like People and Calendar, are slightly different. But they feel squeezed, especially People.When it comes to third party apps, most function fine. However, Evernote keeps crashing on me. It will not open at all. Same with Slice. Whether or not this is due to Android 4.3 or the device itself, I don't know. Maybe someone can shed some light on this?Also, I am starting to find apps that are incompatible with the Nexus 7. I have never had this problem before with the Nexus 4. But one game I play quite often, Blitz Brigade, is not compatible. What's weird is that the Nexus 7 has the same CPU and RAM as the Nexus 4! Why it is incompatible I have no idea. But this is very frustrating.Ultimately, the best things about the Nexus 7 are its price, screen, and speakers. Android is a great phone OS, but it just doesn't feel as good on a tablet. The Android tablet experience definitely feels lacking in certain ways. But I expect this to improve as the OS matures.One thing in particular I do not like about the tablet experience is the lack of synchronized notifications. For example, I just got a notification from the default calendar app about an event coming up. I got the notification on both my Nexus 7 and Nexus 4. And I have the same Google Calendar synced on both devices. Yet if I dismiss the notification on one device, I am still required to dismiss it on the other device. Synchronized notifications is something that is sorely needed in Android.The Nexus 7 is a great and affordable way to get a foot in the Android tablet arena. If you are on the fence about it, you should definitely buy it and give it at least a week and see how you like it. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(7378, 7392)",1,0.0,False

In 2 different locations of residence, I've experienced the same issues.2. I've worked with Linksys/Cisco to try to resolve the issue, and I'm on my second one with the issue starting to occur again.3. I've changed channels, equipment and so forth, but Wireless on this device is very, very bad.What are the issues?1. Poor reception on some units.2. Constant disconnecting on most Laptops.3. Major issues when using an Xbox.  If you have an xbox, avoid this router like the plague.  Even when port forwarding and MTU is configured, you will kill connections to ALL other devices on the network.4. ""Auto"" channel is absolutely useless.5. No external antennas.6. Overheats like it's its job, even when in the open.7. Too much ""over simplifying"" for end-users has turned it into a piece of garbage.  Being easy is one thing, but adding a massive amount of trash to an install to make it better, ends up creating more problems in the end.8. No options for Tomato or DD-WRT, as it's locked down.9. Service stinks.  You'll be hours trying to get an RMA if that's even your problem; mine ended up just being that the hardware is horrible.In summary, don't buy this thing.  I had a netgear dual band router that was 10 times the reliability that this is, and it's hard for me to say that, considering I literally work on Cisco equipment all day.  I only switched because lightning burnt up my Netgear and this one was cheaper.  Never again will I make the same mistake.  I promise you, you'll eventually be disappointed in this.

However, at this price, ""I like it"" a lot. If it is durable it may earn my ""I love it"" -- especially since I will probably use it pretty hard (8-12 hours a day, in and out of a laptop bag nearly every work day), and since it is a $15 mouse I won't be all that careful about it.It is my main mouse for a desktop replacement laptop, both travel with me to work most days. So, I will see how it holds up and update if it wares out or develops problems - if I don't update that means that it is still going strong and I still stand by this review. If it lasts into the 5 year range I will update and probably change it to 5 stars.Next the review points:Pros:To start, I like this mouse. It feels good in my medium-large man hands. The grip on the thumb side feels good; although, I had to push mine into place as it was peeling on arrival and it continues to be somewhat loose or prone to getting pulled out of place, it sits to high above the surrounding plastic [Edit, this continues to be ""loose""]. (I do wish there was a thin strip on the pinky side.)The adjustable DPI will probably be nice for some light game play and some situations, but I generally just keep it on the lowest setting. But having the option is a bonus.The mouse is nice and responsive and I have not noticed any lags (I'm using it on an Ivy Bridge I5 3230m in a Toshiba Satellite L series, Windoze 8 and will be dual booting Kubuntu, when I get a chance to set it up; if I don't update the mouse works fine as a native in Ubuntu as I expect it will [edit, confirmed, works in every distro I've played around with lately (all Debian/Ubuntu forks)]).The back and forward rocker works great and is also very nice to have.The mouse moves smoothly and works on every reasonable surface I've tried it on, including the number pad on the side of my laptop keyboard, which is nice.Range is good, as advertised about 15 feet through walls, etc and about 25 feet in the perfect situation (in the same room or outside).Cons:I wish it had a real off switch since it wakes the Laptop up on button click, until the mouse shuts itself off; you have to take the dongle out when you are transporting the laptop or shut off the wake up settings.This boarders on nitpicking and is related to the previous point: I wish it had a clip like some Logitech mice do so that it clips to the back of my screen and when clipped it shuts off the mouse so that it doesn't wake up the pc -- [edit, I really, really wish that it had such a clip]. This is a good thing because it protects the mouse by ensuing that it is in the padded case with the laptop, rather than just thrown into the bag or outside pocket to get banged, bumped, and (maybe) broken. I really don't understand why anyone would manufacture a wireless mouse without this feature. It just makes good business sense and is relatively cheap.Finally, the mouse does feel a bit less high end. As I mentioned the grip pad for the thumb was out when I took it out of the box, but other things don't quite fit right. One corner of the battery cover sticks out and is a bit stiff to remove (feels like you might break it), but hopefully I'll only replace the battery ever year or so.Overall the mouse feels just solidish. As in, somehow I suspect it isn't as durable is my partners beat up 3-4 year old Logitech that is still going strong. But only time will tell and that Logitech was almost twice the price.Nit-picking (in order of importance):The scrolling wheel is a little high and I wish it was closer to the tip of my middle finger.This boarders on obnoxious nitpicking, but the material you touch is that slick glossy plastic and I wish it had a bit of texture.The slick material feels, sweaty or something, I don't know, I don't like touching it as much as other mouse textures -- yeah, it is nitpicky, I know.At this point I strongly recommend this product. I like it a lot right now for its price, but if it proves durable that may make me love it (as in 5 stars).If you are a cheap-skate like me and looking for a good mouse, I think this is it. If you are a high-end type, this isn't it.I will update when the battery dies, currently it has one AA Eneloop that was fully charged when installed.[Edit, a month after purchase, I like it okay, but I think the 4 stars will stick and I very much wish that I'd gotten one with a off switch and/or a clip -  I would've payed $10-15 more for these things.] ANSWERNOTFOUND",The grip on the thumb side feels good,"(863, 900)",2,0.6000000000000001,True

I own 4 of these ""kits"", basically the D3100 and the 18-55 lens.  My company does high volume photography, mostly sports, schools and events (we will photograph over 90,000 kids this year) and I thought I would give these a shot to see how they would hold up for some of my basic sports portraits shoots and I am pleasantly surprised.  Make note of the word PORTRAITS after sports, we do not use these for action.I actually compared this, side by side, shot by shot with the Canon T2i when deciding which way to go since I was going to be purchasing so many of them.  It was actually a pretty big decision since I was deciding on a Nikon camera when my personal camera is a Canon 7D.  When comparing the 2 cameras I literally set them up on tripods right next to each other, took shots in the exact same settings, conditions, etc.  First, I compared everything in Manual mode, then I let the camera do the work in Shutter Priority, Aperture Priority and full Program Mode.  Without running through every single shot I can simply say the Nikon D3100 beat the Canon t2i, much to my surprise.  This was a VERY close comparison and, in the end, the price of the Nikon helped tip the scale in that direction.Image QualityThe D3100 wins here.  How, you say, is that possible?  The Canon is 18 megapixel and the Nikon is only 14.2...true, but Nikon has a secret weapon, the 18-55 lens!  Believe it or not, the 18-55 Nikon lens, the KIT lens that comes on this camera and many others, is actually one of the sharpest images Nikon makes.  I wouldn't believe it if I hadn't taken hundreds of shots, blown them up to 100% and compared them side by side.  Now, if you are looking for something where you plan to change lenses from time to time, then the Canon is the better choice.  However, in the case of my very specific needs, where I will never need to change out the lens on this camera because it is for sports portrait shoots only, you cannot beat the D3100.  I actually chose the Canon for another area of my business out of state where I needed more durability and flexibility...more on that in another review.As with any product, it will ultimately boil down to how you plan to use it.  If you are a consumer who is just getting into Digital SLR cameras, this is a great way to start.  It is cheap and it takes great images.  It has video, which is nice, although I do not use it so I can't give an in depth review of that functionality.  Make sure that you get the kit with the 18-55 lens though, that makes a big difference in image quality.It also has a great little feature that would be really helpful to beginners trying to understand how Aperture works.  It has a little animation on the LCD screen that shows an actual camera iris opening or closing as you adjust the aperture, which is helpful for beginners trying to understand the lower number being a bigger aperture concept.So, to sum it up:PROS:Price: You can't beat it, if you watch Amazon closely you will be able to catch it in the $500 range or maybe a bit less if you are luckyImage Quality:  Really amazing image quality WITH the 18-55 lens especially.Good for Beginners:  Has some really good tutorials to help beginners understand the basics of DSLR.Great ""Auto"" settings:  Produces really nice images on many of the standard settings for Shutter and Aperture Priority and full Program.  (although I recommend to beginners to try to learn how to shoot in Manual mode at least to understand how it works and NEVER use any of the silly settings like ""Sports"" or the other ones.)CONS:Not very tough:  It feels a lot cheaper than the CanonReally small:  It looks ridiculous with an SB900 flash on it!  (This is a con for me but might be a pro for others)Overall, I definitely recommend it for a beginner or someone with a very specific professional need like I have.  It earns 5 stars for how I use it. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(4073, 4087)",1,0.0,False

I also have an iPad 3. I have worked in IT for the past few years so I would say I am pretty good with technology and fancy new devices. With that introduction out of the way, I will be reviewing key points that I have seen touched upon in other reviews. Here goes...BUILDThe device feels nice and solid. I'm a little surprised at how heavy it is, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The rubberized backing is always nice for added grip. It's not as nice as say unibody aluminum, but it's not $500 either.SCREENThe screen is fantastic. But my problem is the same as when iPad got Retina Display, other than the OS, most apps look rather pixelated. A lot of the games I tried are not high definition, at least not high enough to look smooth on this screen. Hopefully apps get updated to higher resolutions.LOCK SCREEN ADSYeah there are ads on my lock screen. I'm not sure why this is such a big deal. How much time do people really spend looking at the lock screen? The first thing I thought when I saw the ads is WOW the pictures are really crisp! The ads are there to subsidize some of the $200 price tag. I might pay the $15 to get rid of them so I can customize it, but I might not. I feel like this has been blown out of proportion by other customers.SOUNDThe sound from the speakers is great. Much better than you would get from more expensive devices, very crisp and clean. I have the official Amazon case on and it has not affected the sound at all. Nothing much else to say, I doubt anyone will complain about this.CRASHINGI've had two apps crash on opening. I don't know if it is the app or the OS. It's probably somewhere in the middle. Again, not a big deal for me. If it crashes, then I just tap it again and it works. I've also watched a few movies using the built in player as well as Netflix and Amazon Prime. No crashes for me at all. I'm sure OS stability will be improved as time goes on.OVERALL SATISFACTIONCompared to my iPad 3, obviously the Fire HD is not as ""good"" so to speak. I mainly got it because I wanted something smaller. I also mainly used the iPad to surf the web, watch videos, and play some simple games. The Fire HD accomplishes this and does so much more. If you are expecting an iPad killer, or a desktop replacement, or a productivity machine, then you should look elsewhere.I bought this to be a media device, and I believe that is what Amazon meant this to be. In this regard, I think this is a great device. In fact, I decided to keep this and sell my iPad 3, which will give me another $200+ to spend on other things. Just remember, this device is not for everyone. If you want a media device, you will be happy with this. Do not expect an iPad for $200.UPDATE 9/18/12Just wanted to add a few more things I have noticed over the past 24 hours.- Power/Volume Buttons: There are a bit hard to press, which is somewhat alleviated by having the official case. Maybe it's because I'm a longtime iPad user, but this will definitely take some getting used to.- Screen Glare: It took me a little while to notice, but I was playing a Seek & Find game while on Caltrain, with the bright Palo Alto sun shining right on me, and didn't have any trouble seeing the screen. I remembered that Amazon mentioned how the screen was changed to reduce glare, and they did an amazing job.UPDATE 9/20/12Two days later and I am still very happy with the device. Here are some more thoughts from me:BATTERY LIFEI have been playing Enigmatis (a hidden object game) for about an hour and a half each day on my commute. This drains about 15 - 20% of the battery with the screen brightness almost at the highest setting. Again, not iPad gold standard, but still very good.SYNCING MUSICI have a Samsung Galaxy S3 and used an app called Easy Phone Transfer to get all my music from iTunes onto the phone. It transferred everything, including album covers, and I was hoping to find something like that for this device. I tried iSyncr, a $3 app, which did the job, but did not sync over album covers. I uploaded all my music into the Cloud, then downloaded it from Amazon, which increased the audio quality for a lot of my songs and added artwork, but this still did not show up on the device.I got very frustrated getting all the album artwork over and eventually just gave up. It's not a big deal but I am kind of anal about those kinds of things. Just a heads up if anyone else out there is crazy about it like I am.UPDATE 09/21/12I got a call from Amazon Customer Service about this review, which surprised me very much. They advised me the best way to get the artwork to show up is have the songs in both the Cloud Player as well as the device, which I know does work fine. I was hoping to have the artwork show without needing things in the Cloud, but not a big deal any more.I am more impressed with the fact that Amazon called me to give me advice on how to remedy the situation and ask if there were any other questions I had on the Kindle. The representative said he wanted to make sure I was happy with the Fire HD. This is one of the big reasons I went with the Kindle, and with Amazon in general. I have had great experiences with their customer service, who have always been able to handle my issues quickly and efficiently. No need to set up an appointment days later with a wannabe IT guy with a hugely overstated job title.So this update is not really for the device itself, but sometimes it's not just the device, it's the company that offers it that makes a difference. This is why I no longer have any Apple devices, as cool as they may be. But it's not 100% gravy, as I have noticed lately that the keyboard keeps popping up randomly on screens where there is nowhere to enter text, ie. while playing a game. I just have to press the Back arrow to get rid of it, but maybe a bug the Amazon engineers want to take a look at.UPDATE 10/05/12So I don't know if it was always there, but over this past weekend I noticed a dead pixel on my Kindle's screen. I called Kindle Support and after a short 5 minute call, they sent me a new Kindle, no questions asked. So once again, very happy with Amazon customer service. I am still very happy with the device, and have some more thoughts on it:HDMI CONNECTIONI bought an HDMI cable to hook up the Fire to my 46"" Samsung and was quite impressed with the results. The quality was very good, not Bluray quality of course, but better than SDTV on an HD screen. You actually see every single thing you do on the big screen, like you are using a giant Kindle.GOOGLE PLAY APPSOne of the main drawbacks in my opinion is, or should I say was, the lack of all the Google Play apps available on the Kindle. With a little research, I found out how to add apps that are not available in the Amazon store. It is pretty easy to do and works very well with the apps I tried. This greatly improves my opinion of the Fire HD.PLASTIC AROUND THE SCREENThe outer most edges of the Kindle are plastic. I noticed some kind of discoloration on the corner of mine, and just thought it was some dirt to scratch off. So I rubbed my thumb nail on the area, and noticed there were visible marks on the plastic. It appears this plastic can scratch some what easily, but I think this is just cosmetic as not of the plastic actually flaked. If you are not very anal about how your stuff looks, you probably won't notice it.OS CHANGESHere are two small gripes I have with the OS that I'm sure could be fixed with an OS update:- Battery Meter: It would be nice if the battery meter could show percentage instead of just a graphic bar. Some people have mentioned Battery HD, but you still have to swipe down to see the percentage, so this makes it easier but does not solve the issue I had.- Personal Videos: The mp4 videos I put on the device are located in the ""Personal Videos"" app, which shows screen shots of all the videos I put in. The problem is, all that is shown are the screen shots. You can get more info by holding your finger down on each video, but when you have multiple seasons of a show on the Kindle, it can get confusing. Ideally we should be able to look at videos in a list like our music.UPDATE 11/15/12Still very happy with the device. Here are some more thoughts:LEFT HAND MODEI did't think this would be a problem until I played a Solitaire game that DID have a left-handed mode. As a lefty who usually uses the Fire in landscape, I often have to reach across the screen to access the Settings or Home button in the menu. It's a small grievance, but can be really annoying when watching a movie or reading something. If there was an option for a left-handed layout with the menus on the left side of the device, that would be great.PERSONAL VIDEOS APPI had earlier complained about this app, as it did not list my movies and crashed playing a pair of them. I recently drove down to LA from SF, and put 5 movies on device, only to find that 4 of them would not play! I was pretty mad, until I remembered a simple solution, download another app. I downloaded Avia Media Player, which is not the greatest either, but it played all the movies I put on the Kindle. My faith was restored.GOOGLE PLAY APPSA lot of people have asked how to do this.

I'm copying 40gb of video on there right now and it says the estimated wait time is 30 minutes. Not too bad. And in actuality it will probably be closer to 20 minutes.- Sleek design: though external hard drive owners are probably more concerned with keeping their files safe, the design here will hopefully also appeal to the trendy-seekers too. I like the silver stripe and the overall look and feel. Definitely more attractive than my others.- Runs quiet/cool: doesn't make any hideous chugging sounds and doesn't get extremely hot. This is good news.- Good price. 3 TB isn't anything to laugh at, so I think this device is quite affordable given the amount of data it can holdCONS:- For Windows users, you will have to download software from their website for the computer to recognize the external hard drive. Honestly, I would rather have something without any software at all. I just want my files on there like a mega USB drive. But whatever, it isn't that big of a deal. For Mac users, you will be able to install the software directly after connecting it to your computer.OVERALL: As long as the drive doesn't crash on me, I can't really complain about it. Good amount of memory, good speed, quiet/cool, nice design. I have a few other Seagates and they seem to be a good brand. No issues. I'd recommend this one as well.

It seemsone of the minor complaints are that the blue ball isn't as smooth as the old Red Ball.Well I still have one Red Ball from one of my old Trackballs that broke and willtest it with this new version and report back.Hey the red ball might not even work but I don't see why it shouldn't work..who knows .When I take delivery I will report back with an update .:)Edit: Well my trackball arrived today.Firs off it's much smaller than the old redball version. I wanted totest the red ball in this one but it won't fit so that's out.I'm a woman so I don't have big hands but I don't have tiny hands. That being said it fits my hand perfect. If you have big hands you might not like the fit but that shouldn't stop you if you are currently using a mouse which is smaller than the trackball.Yes the new blue ball doesn't have that slick feel that the redball had butit's still slick. You can tell the difference between the 2 if you used/owned the redball version.The blue ball is much smaller than the red ball but it doesn't hurt performance.I plugged the unifyer into the usb port and windows installed the correct driver in seconds. By the way I have Windows 7 64  and I was up and running right away..so yes no problems with windows 7 /64 for those of you that might be wondering.The 2 extra buttons on the side are programmed to go back and forward which is what I already intended to use them for anyway. Someone said the location of the 2 buttons was bad but I don't see the problem .Even if your index finger (Which is used for 1 click)wereto brush up against the side buttons nothing would happen becasue they are sturdy enough for side swipes to not activate causing you to go backward or forward.  And of course the scroll wheel which works as intended. This is without installing the software. There's no software DVD but you can get it directly from Logitechs website if you choose.One thing I don't care for much is the blueball location which is for thumb use. I like theold version where you used your index finger.It's just easier to control with the index finger than the thumb . It's not a biggie no no and there's no problem controlling the blue ball but I rather myself using the index finger.It already comes with a battery (Only needs one) and a duracell to boot.There's 4 rubber feet on the bottom which hide the screws so I'm guessing it should be easy to clean if need to when you run out of warranty.What I'm really pissed about is the price..I ordered this 2 days ago and now the price is much cheaper. I'm going to email them to see if I can get credit...hey it's like $10 with shipping..even the shipping was more 2 days ago.Big plus no freaking long wire hanging off the side of my laptop !Bottom line I'm happy again :)PS:This vendor doesn't respond to emails..a simple yes or no was required of them but I guess customer service doesn't mean anything to them.----------------------------------------------------Edit: Nov 8th 2010This vendor never did reply to my request mentioned above.

This is my second tablet and I compare a lot of my expectations for a tablet to the Vizio tablet which I loved and never had a problem with, but wanted more memory than 4GB.First off, the Lenovo K1 has a nice big/bright display. I have watched a few Amazon instant videos and YouTube clips and they look great. The speakers are small but don't sound too bad, but this is no Bose system either. The K1 comes with a ton of apps and some are the full/pay versions such as Documents to Go. I have deleted some of the preloaded apps and have used the included Android market and Lenovo market to download other apps as well as the Amazon app market. The K1 also has GPS built in and has the Google navigation app that is pretty cool, but I will probably still use my Garmin due to it being smaller for use in my car. The K1 doesn't weigh too much and is not too bulky either. The performance is pretty fast and I have had no lags of opening or closing apps.Before I bought the Lenovo K1 I did a lot of research and saw many mixed reviews. After unboxing my K1, I updated the software to the latest version and then performed a factory reset. My K1 works perfectly and I do not have the crashing, forced closure of apps, of system freezes that many have complained about and wonder if they updated to the 829 software build(latest version as of now)and performed a factory reset if that might fix their problems.My suggestion is to go to a brick and mortar store such as Office Depot and try the Lenovo K1 out for yourself. If you like it, buy it from Amazon and save yourself some money aswell as the tax and you also get free shipping. With the money saved, you can buy a nice case to put your k1 in.*** July 2012 Update.***While my K1 has been pretty much trouble free, I can no longer recommend the K1 or any other Lenovo product. Lenovo's support of its product is pretty poor. Lenovo has an accessory called a USB host cable that makes it possible to hook up USB objects to the K1. The USB host cable was included with the K1 in Europe and other overseas locations but not in the US, when enough people complained, Lenovo received a small amount and took over a month to distribute what they had. Most owners missed out as you had only about 48 hours to order this cable and the only notification that lenovo was going to sell this cable was on a forum on thier website. Lenov also promised owners of the K1 an update to the newest version of the android software 4.0, so far Lenovo has not deliverd and the release date keeps slipping and may never arrive.Due to these problems, I NO LONGER RECOMMEND LENOVO products.

The IBIS is as good as people say, and the pictures are stunning especially when used with good glass.

The image quality from the OM-D with the primes listed above far exceeds what I ever got from my Nikon setup so I had no hesitation in selling it all. And with my new setup being so small and light, I find I am much more likely to take it with me. The OM-D and Pany/Oly prime lenses have renewed my interest in photography and I am enjoying every minute.Note: The resolution, noise levels, and dynamic range of the OM-D are very comparable to the newest high end Nikon crop sensor bodies. It still doesn't compare to Nikon Full Frame bodies, obviously the sensor size does limit that, but given the cost of a FF body and FF (FX) lenses, not to mention the weight, I think 90% of photographers would be fine with this set-up.I hope this is helpful.

I'll list a few pros and cons and then talk about what I think of the product overall.Pros-Easy to use, feels amazing. It uses a usb stick to do everything, although you do need to have your own charger cable as it doesn't come with one (USB to mini usb). The headset is very comfortable and has plushy padding on the ear cups and head band. I have no problem wearing these for lengthy gaming sessions (3 hours or more) or watching a couple movies in a row.-Packs a lot of sound, for it being virtual 7.1 it sounds great but not amazing. If you're used to high end headsets/headphones this might not be the thing for you, but if you're looking to save some money and still have a decent headset then you definitely want to pick this up. The stereo sounds good, but the virtual surround sound is the way to go.-Looks fantastic, this is one of the better looking headsets I've owned. It might not be for everyone, but I really like the design of this.-Absolutely wireless, this is a huge plus for me as I hate having to deal with wires.-I've talked with friends over games and over skype and they all say that the mic sounds good, but for skype I normally use my Blue Snowball USB mic anyway.Cons-Controls for sound/volume are weird. There are two control slides, one for game/movie volume and one for voice chat (in game). When I'm playing with friends and we're in an intense game, sometimes I'll need to adjust the headset so I can hear them better rather than the game volume. I've noticed that it's just easier to take off the headset entirely and change it that way that moving my hand behing my head in a somewhat awkward position. It's not a deal breaker by any means buts till annoying.-While I complimented the sound in the pros, I need to mention it in the cons as well. It's not going to blow you away, the virtual surround is good but it's still virtual. I've noticed the highs are great, the mids are awesome, but the lows are just alright.Those are the main points I wanted to make, but I also want to note that before this headset I owned a pair of Tritton AX Pros. The Tritton's were beast, had great sound and a great sounding mic. They weren't without fault though as they were really heavy on my head. Felt like a full pound or so, while this Sony headset is really light and feels great on the ears. The Tritton's also required a whole slew of wires to be attached and taken off then reattached: it was a mess. The number one reason for me getting this Sony headset is because it's wireless, the second was the amazing price. The sound is about 3.75 stars, while the price bumps it to about 4.5. I would like to give it a 4.5 star rating but Amazon doesn't allow .5 increments, and it's definitely not a 5 star headset so 4 stars will have to do.I hope this rather long review helps you in your buying process.Z ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2947, 2961)",1,0.0,False

It's actually one of the best screens I have ever seen on a tablet.  It actually blows the N8000s screen away.  Its very easy on the eyes while browsing the internet, reading a book or watching a movie.4 core 1.9 GHz Processing Power with 3gb of ram:The tablet can handle close to any application that is thrown at it.  After the updates and factory reset, S Note imported the entire 56 page pdf while the N8013 was still importing slide 17 of 56.  While playing graphically intense games, the tablet is smooth as butter.  When switching between apps and screens, the tablet does so rapidly with no lag.8220 mAh Battery:The original N8013 had around a 7000 mAh Battery and use to last all day.  However the increased processing speed and screen capabilities may draw excess power from the 2014 note's 8220 mAh battery.  So far, the Note 2014 has decent battery life.  The screen has been on for 7 hours and 43 minutes.  While the screen was on, I was taking notes with Lecture Notes for about 4-5 hours.  I spent about 30 minutes using Handy Scanner, an app that takes photos of documents and imports them into pdf files.  Also, I sent a lot of emails and uploaded a lot of files to to my Google Drive.  the brightness level of the screen was about 20% which is really bright in a lit room.  The battery is at 14%.  I got up at 6:00 am and started using it.  It is now 9:26pmRear 8 MP Camera:The camera is an upgrade over the 5MP camera on the N8013, however because the screen has a really good resolution, it seems to make the picture seem worse than it is.  I have this effect on my desktop computer with two monitors, bad pictures look better on the screen with the poorer resolution.  Anyhow, objectively, the camera is just like the ones from last year's cell phones.  The added flash is nice to have because a lot of tablets seem to leave this essential feature out.Capacity:Either you have the 16 GB or the 32 GB version; I'm pretty sure you know the benefits of both.  However its important to note that the 32 GB version leaves around 25 GB of actual space to use.  With the N8013, I never filled up the flash drive despite having close to 1000 songs, 200+ photos, and a years worth of lecture notes and document files.  However, usage patterns do vary; if you are the type of person that likes large games, then you could certainly get the 32 GB model of the device and then store extra content on a 64GB micro SD card.Applicability of Software Features:S Note:The main critical point of the 1st edition of this review revolved around S Note and the lag; S Note and the slow performance are the main reasons that I bought the tablet; the initial experiences ruined this tablet for me.  However, THE FACTORY RESET CLEARED UP ALL OF THE LAG/INSTABILITY IN S NOTE AND SYSTEM WIDE.S Note has a new interface that really contrasts with previous versions of S Note.  Shape and Formula Match have been separated from the main tool bar and included under the heading transform, the icon that resembles the cloud.On first thought, this seems innovative, however compared to the old version of Shape Match, this process can be counter productive.  For instance, on the old version, one could just select the shape match tool and then draw the shape.  If unhappy with the shape, the user could simply press the undo arrow and try again.  However, on the new version, you must write the text first and then transform it into a shape or text via the selection tool.  If you make a mistake, you must press undo and fix the thing that you were trying to transform.  This feature is annoying and counter productive in my opinion.  I frequently take Cornell notes where you draw a line down the middle of the paper, closer to the left side of the sheet.  With the new set up, I have two extra steps, I have to draw a line and then draw a free form or rectangular box around the imperfect line that I drew just to turn it into a straight line...As far as having Wolfram Alpha solve equations directly through S Note, some users have reported that its imbedded in the keyboard some where.Concerning old .snb files, the tablet does not support them on the fly, but it CAN convert them to the new format.  After the factory reset, the tablet is quicker and more stable at converting the .snb files; there have been no crashes during conversion.First glance, the previews to notebooks are gone on the new version of S Note.  The previews to the notes have been replaced with realistic looking book covers.  If you once depended on looking at the note in order to easily find it, think again; to get a preview, you must drag the icon down towards the bottom of the screen.There are more advanced templates available on the device; they actually look pretty nice.  Instead of calling home made templates ""templates,"" the device has a feature to import a photo to be used as a background for notes; this is better than nothing.As far as sync accounts within S Note, Google Drive seems to be missing as an option.  If there is a way to add it, please someone respond so that I can edit this.  In the mean time, I will look for a solution.  Currently on the 2014 model, Sync options include the Samsung Account and Evernote.Writing with the new S pen seems smoother and better, however that's due to the increased friction.  The increased friction seems to slow down writing a little, but an after market pen or more use may rectify this problem.[Edit: S Note Conversion/Import/Export File Sizes and Time to CompleteIF the relationship between file size and import/export/conversion time is linear, these results should be able to be generalized to your hypothetical 50,000KB files.My test file was a 16,314 KB pdf. To import the file, it took 197 seconds; this substantially quicker than the N8013. For your hypothetical file of 50,000 KB, the import would take around 10 minutes or 603.78 seconds IF the relationship is linear.This same 16,314KB pdf translated into a 59.74MB .spd S Note file once it was imported without any annotations. It took 40 seconds to export this file to a pdf document. For your hypothetical file of 50,000 KB, the pdf export should be around 122 seconds or 2 minutes.As far as converting .snb files to the new .spd format, the relationship seems to be 2 and a half minutes/80,000KB .snb file.]Multiview:Multiview is still here on the 2014 note.  Its useful but it doesn't use the same intuitive methods as the N8013 does.  Simply tapping on the icon for Multiview does not launch it along side another window, you must drag it over.I as well as other users initially reported that there is no pin window feature.  Upon further exploration, this is not true.  It is accessible from the Air View window; you must draw a space for the application and then select from the limited supply of apps including; calculator, alarm, You Tube, contacts, ChatOn, Hangouts, and internet.  In my opinion, this is counter productive in comparison to the old simple pin window button.Browser:The default browser has trouble with saving .ppt and .doc formats.  I went to blackboard and tried to download a .ppt for viewing and Polaris 5 wouldn't open it.  Using the Blackboard app rectified this occurrence.  I have not tested with Chrome yet.Polaris Office:Polaris Offcice is a great alternative to Microsoft Office for editing or creating documents on the fly.  I mainly use Polaris for converting powerpoints to pdf so that they can be imported to S note.  Polaris 5 can also be used for direct pdf and powerpoint annotations; this method does not seem to support palm rejection, but it's still very useful for those that follow slides, type notes on slides and do light annotations to the slides.Watch On:This is a great TV guide like application.  The bonus is that it uses the built in IR blaster.  This is a cool feature if you are missing the remote or want to impress friends.My Magazine:This is a great media hub for news.  If you follow world news, you can have a great deal of information in this one app.Sketchbook For Galaxy/ Photoshop Touch:Sketchbook For Galaxy is a great alternative to the missing Photoshop touch.  The sketchbook app provides an experience even closer to the real Photoshop desktop app.Samsung Perks:[Retrieved 10/27/2013 12:50 Central Time]""Get a $50 credit for music, movies and TV shows through Samsung Hub and a $25 credit for games and apps through the Google Play(tm) Store. New Hulu Plus users get a 3-month trial and new Boingo users get mobile Wi-Fi access for 12 months. Also, new Audible users get 3 free audiobooks and new Zinio members get a 2-month subscription to 3 digital magazines. New BusinessWeek+ Tablet App users can also enjoy a 1-year free subscription, and new NYTimes.com + Tablet App users get a 12-week free subscription. All that, plus up to 50GB of Dropbox space--yours for 2 years from the time you set up the app.""These perks speak for themselves :]User Interface:The tablet's user interface seems counterproductive in comparison to the more simple nature of the first edition.  There are some things that touchwiz does better and some things that it does worse.  All I can say is that the settings section is very confusing.  For example, Samsung even hid the developer options; they can only be unhidden by tapping the build # a number of times...Coming from the N8013's simplistic nature can be kind of harsh, but it is certainly doable.  Read the user guide or google the answers to your confusion.Physical Attributes:The tablet aesthetically is really nice on the eyes.  I always thought that the original N8013 was a little homely.  I'm not sure why the ""pleather"" (plastic leather) look has people complaining.  I think it looks nice.I do not like the capacitive buttons nor the home button on the bezel.  It becomes cumbersome to hold  the tablet in portrait mode; sometimes your hand may hit one of the capacitive buttons or it may be awkward to intentionally use them while the device is in portrait mode.  I have always found the softkeys that rotate with the screen better.  In addition, I don't like the feel of the home button, it seems like it may degrade over time; in my opinion, the less physical buttons, the better.  The iPhone, iPad, and iPod  home buttons of earlier generations seem more sturdy than button on the 2014 note; this may not be true, it's just a subjective thought.The S Pen tip certainly feels better on the screen compared to last year's model.  In addition, the S Pen seems even more comfortable to write with despite its skinny nature.  Another bonus is that it doesn't require a special rotation to get the S Pen into the stylus holder slot.Concerning weight and thinness, the tablet does look cooler than the previous edition, but if you are highly protective of the device and put it in a case, all of that really doesn't matter.The shift from Samsung's special usb cable is really nice.  Now, the tablet can interact with the USB cables that our smart phones have been using for years!Upgrade Experience:There are a lot of things that the tablet does that are similar to the N8000s, however there are a lot of things that are different.  There will be a learning curve and importing your old notes to the new note is not as straightforward as it could be.  However, the improved processing speed and screen are very compelling reasons to get this tablet.As of now, I officially recommend this tablet to new users or people that upgrade from a previous generation note.Again, I must reiterate  that after the factory reset, the tablet is much more stable and is quicker than the 2012/2013 model.  Moving forward, I want to thank those that participated in the discussion because their feedback and suggestions helped me to give this tablet another try.BEFORE BASHING THE TABLET AND INITIATING A RETURN PROCESS, TRY A FACTORY RESET AFTER THE UPDATES; I learned my lesson lol ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(12810, 12824)",5,0.0,False

Until recently, I mostly used either a USB optical mouse or the touchpad on my laptop and did just fine.That being said, I am in the process of building a workstation for video editing.  I decided to invest in a mouse and since I was going with a Mac, I decided I should keep it stylish in case I have clients over - I dropped a hefty amount on a keyboard/mouse setup and was anxious until I hooked the Magic Mouse up.Immediately, I fell in love.  Bluetooth connected seamlessly and the mouse was a dream, even if it didn't have a direct line of sight.  As a matter of fact, I haven't had a single moment of unresponsiveness.The touch controls on the mouse are wonderful.  I normally don't review products, but the ability to swipe between programs and scroll from the mouse is great and practically multiplies productivity.As far as ergonomics go, the mouse is just OK.  It seems like it's just a little too thin, but so far I haven't had any pain, just a little discomfort which I'm going to attribute to a learning curve.The final (fixable) issue is the lack of touch commands supported by Apple.  Because the top half of the mouse is essentially a touch pad, it should be that we can do much more than simply clicking, but this isn't really supported.  Downloading a third party plugin (better touch tool for Mac) solved this problem - I can even launch programs by using a custom hand movement just with my mouse.  I absolutely recommend this mouse for Mac users. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1646, 1660)",5,0.0,False

And missing parts. This had me worried.that i would receive a product that would be poorly made. And it took 3 days just to start the shipping process. Figured they were throwing stuff in a box as they went. The box they used was a commercial box it wasn't like they just threw it in a paper bag.My experience was completely opposite. They provide you with more than enough bolts. Every tv is different they cant possibly match every TV in the world. But they sure did their best they offered 3 different sizes of mounting bolts. Everything was neatly labeled in plastic bags by letter, and part name.The instructions were so simple a 3 year old could do it. As with all machined equipment best advice is if something isn't lining up DONT TRY TO FORCE IT. Just think it thru turn it like a puzzle until things line up perfect.That being said, there were a few down sides that i've also seen from other comments. The adjustment of the swivel makes no sense to me. If you adjust it then the locking pin wont line up or the screws wont line up.. something wont line up if you swivel it.Finally the safety pins are a pain in the you know what to screw in if you have a thin tv. It's so close to the wall. And i wouldn't suggest not tightening them as any upward motion to the tv you risk the thing falling down. I had to find a socket that would fit around my screw driver, attach the socket to an extension arm... just to be able to reach the screw.I'd suggest that Cheetah consider making some sort of an extension rod that can be used to help reach them. Even if it's just a solid bar with a Phillips head on the end and a nut on the other that you can attach a socket wrench to and use it to reach the screws.I'm not sure how much this would raise the cost, and i  commend them on how many extra bolts and washers they provide. Those have to add up over time. just to have the extras thrown away.Another note, by the advise of my father who helped me hang the thing, an ex carpenter, we ditched the anchors since we were drilling into studs. Just drilled a pilot hole(tiny hole) and used a ratchet to screw the lag screw in. From doing minimal research on the internet(and i suggest you do the same) anchors are only needed for concrete or if you cant find the stud.Long story short, i  had a pleasant experience. It fit my 60 inch Panasonic and i have no doubt it will hold firm.May ever order a second one for my other TV. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2518, 2532)",1,0.0,False

It may also serve well as a working drive that's used more intensively but for temporary or replaceable files - such as a scratch drive or a media server.This drive is large enough and priced low enough that you can backup multiple computers for not a lot of money.However, if you're looking for an expansion drive - a second drive to augment a laptop or desktop - that you will use intensively, consider options with cooling and perhaps backup, especially if you will use the drive for your only copy of files.A DESKTOP DRIVE:  This is a desktop drive, not a truly portable drive.  You could use it to backup multiple computers around a home or office, but you're not going to enjoy carrying the drive and the power supply.A FAST CONNECTION:  USB 3.0 really is fun to use, if you have the right port on your computer to use it.  No more sitting around watching file transfers - the speeds are similar to those of a built in drive.KEEP A BACKUP: One of the keys to happiness in modern life is to keep at least two copies of every computer file you need.  If you have anything you would rather not have vanish tomorrow, get a hard drive - any hard drive - and make a copy. Right now.  Err on the side of caution.ALL HARD DRIVES FAIL - SO REPLACE THEM BEFORE THEY DO:  Hard drives are complex mechanical devices. They will absolutely, inevitably fail.  So manage them accordingly.I replace all my drives after about three to four years (if they survive that long).  It's much easier to replace a drive before it fails - it's very easy to copy a readable drive.  It's much harder to recreate a drive, especially a boot drive, after it fails - you need to reinstall all the software and settings, and maybe reconstruct the folder structure.And hard drives are cheap enough to make it not worth the risk to keep drives around longer than that.  I can usually get a bigger, faster drive for much less money than the original drive.Once you start to accept the reality that hard drives will fail, and manage your drives and data appropriately, you can drastically reduce the disruption that hard drive failures cause.BUY A GOOD MODEL OF DRIVE, THEN KEEP A CURRENT BACKUP:  As much as people like to claim that particular brands are better or worse, statistics don't really seem to back that up.  Buy a good model from one of the top brands - Seagate, Western Digital, Hitachi, Samsung - and then manage them as described above.That being said - some drives (or the firmware they are shipped with) have turned out to be real lemons.  Most of the big manufacturers make good drive models, and they have made bad drive models.  So much like your uncle, who never bought a new model car until they'd worked the bugs out of it - let someone else be at the bleeding edge of hard drives.  Buy models that have been tested by other users.It's a little soon to tell for the drive installed in this particular model, and some of the early feedback is mixed.COOLING QUESTIONS:  I can't really figure out why the cooling is so unconvincing on almost all external drives (like this one).  A tight-fitting plastic case, with no effective ventilation?  Really?  While drive temperature isn't perhaps quite as big an issue as some would make it out to be - that level of cooling just doesn't seem adequate for a drive that's running more than a fraction of the time.  If your needs fit that description - that is, if you need a back up drive, or an intermittently used expansion drive - then this Seagate external drive may be a good matchFOR AN INTENSIVELY USED EXPANSION DRIVE, CONSIDER OTHER OPTIONS:  If you need more space in an expansion drive, and plan to use the drive intensively, consider other options.  Perhaps a NAS (network attached storage) or a drive enclosure with more effective cooling, and possibly something with multiple drives and built in backup.WATCH HOW YOUR DRIVES ARE SHIPPED:  One of the key factors in whether a drive will last is how it's handled and shipped.  External drives such as this one are usually packaged somewhat well, although online vendors still don't seem to really get the concept of filling the shipping box so the product inside doesn't bounce around on its way to you.

However, there were three things that I thought needed improvement: the keyboard, the screen, and storage. In each case, my thought was that they could be a bit larger (but not too large-after all, the main appeal of the EEE PC netbooks is their small size). The EEE PC 1000H provides those improvements and more-and for only a bit more than I paid for my first EEE PC.The main virtue of the EEE PC 1000 H is its small size and light weight. While it is larger than my 4G, it is considerably smaller and lighter than my iBook (dimensions and weight are given below). In practical terms, it fits easily into my rather over-stuffed backpack and does not add noticeably to its weight.  Naturally, if small size is of critical importance, Asus does make even smaller netbooks, such as the 4G and more recent versions.While small size is important, it is really not very useful to have a PC that is too small to use comfortably. While my 4G was quite usable, the 1000H is, from my standpoint, an ideal size. The keyboard is smaller than that of a typical laptop, but the key design and size allows for easy typing-much more so than the 4G. With the 4G I tended to just use one finger typing. With the 1000h I can type normally. The screen is also larger, allowing for easier viewing of documents. Of course, with a height of only 600 it does still impose some limits. I found the screen to be high quality-sharp and responsive. There is also a VGA output, in case you want to attach it to an external monitor.My 4G had a 4 GB SSD drive while my 1000H has a 160 GB HD. The downside of the standard hard drive is that it has moving parts and is a bit slower in booting up relative to the SSD. On the plus side, it has far greater capacity. The 4GB on the 4G was enough for the Linux OS and the base applications, but I had to rely on SD cards and USB keys for extra storage. The 1000H does have the SD reader and plenty of USB ports, but it has considerable storage space. Oddly, the hard drive is partitioned and mounts as two volumes (there are are also hidden volumes as well).While I did not buy a netbook for speed, my 1000H is quite responsive, even running Windows XP. I did not try any recent games, but it runs Starcraft and Diablo II just fine. Microsoft Office was also quite snappy. Overall, most users will find it quite adequate for their needs. Obviously, if you ant to play the latest games or edit video, you will want a laptop with more power. But, it does give a lot of power for the cost.For a low price netbook, it does pack in quite a few extras that you'd expect to only see on something a bit higher up the food chain. These include ethernet, multiple USB 2.0 ports, wireless N, and bluetooth. Everything worked well-it connected to my wireless N network without a hitch. I'm not a big fan of Bluetooth, but it is nice to have that option.It ships with fairly minimal software-mostly just the OS, some very basic utilities and a trial of Office 2007. I actually see this a plus-I hate pulling crapware off my PC and would rather have a nice, clean system. I did consider installing Ubuntu, but decided to stick with XP so I could run Office, Starcraft, Diablo II, and my windows based grading program. Yes, I could probably get everything going in WINE, but I decided to just keep things simple. Besides, my 4G is running Linux.Asus claims that the battery will last for 9.5 hours. I haven't put that to the test, but it is nice to have long battery life. After all, the main point of getting a netbook is so you can easily have it with you. Good battery life is part of this.Mine came with a basic soft case, but I bought a more robust one. If you plan to toss yours into a backpack or travel with it, I'd suggest a case upgrade.Overall, the 1000H is an excellent little machine. If you are looking for a travel laptop, an inexpensive laptop, or one to use at school, this is a great choice. I plan to use mine for both travel (once I can travel again) and at school. My backpack always seems to be packed with notes, student papers, records, my lunch, a water bottle and various other things-so small and light netbook is ideal. I did like my 4G a great deal, but it was just a bit too small for typing and easily entering grades. Hence, I mainly just used it when traveling. But, the 1000H is as comfortable to use as a normal laptop and hence I plan to get much more use from it.So, should you get one? My experience has been that most people tend to over buy when it comes to laptops. That is, they get a machine that far exceeds their needs. After all, surfing the web, doing an email and doing word processing do not take that much power. The 1000H provides more than enough power to do all that and at a very low price (well under $400). Naturally, I'd suggest trying one in person to see if you like the keyboard and screen size; but I think that most people will rather like this machine.

I rooted and then installed the android operating system; it kind of liberated the tablet. It was more responsive, but development of the community was slow because the touchpad was not that popular. Reading on the tablet was really good, but forget about reading in your bed this thing was heavy.  So I decided to sell the HP touchpad. Decided that I was either going to go for the kindle fire HD or nexus 7. I looked at both devices and I was impressed with the performance of both. But the nexus 7 was king in performance.  But what I really disliked was the screen and the storage space of the nexus 7.  So I knew I was going to use the tablet to the maximum so I went with the kindle fire hd because it offered more space. As it is now I only have 6.78 GB left after everything I have done to the tablet.Kindle fire HD ""7"" The reason why I rooted===================================I ended up rooting my kindle fire.  There are tutorials on YouTube and xda developers.  I always like rooting the cell phones and tablets I get my hands on. My hd2 was rooted so many times (rip hd2 best cell phone ever). If could I would root my ti-89 titanium.  So I could not resist myself I had to root my KFHD. Its good feeling that the community is there to help expand the horizons of the product you paid money for. That's the main reason I did not go for the ipad 3. There just so much you can do with the android platform.  There were a lot of apps missing from the kindle store so I had to root the KFHD.Performance=====================The KFHD is pretty snappy, fast I would say.  Sometimes scrolling through the carousel it stutters.  But for the majority of time it's really good. The silk browser is a total lag fest.  So just installed the dolphin browser and wow now that's fast.  Smooth scrolling and pinch to zoom in.It takes a few seconds for the YouTube app to load completely. Also Google maps takes a few seconds to locate your position. When I mean a few seconds like 10 seconds or less. I am not sure why this is happening.  After loading everything is fine.I put some movies files avi and they played fine. They played really nice with dice player.N64oid works really good on the kindle fire hd. Mario kart 64 and ps3 controller work beautifully on kindle fire HD.  Gaming overall is great on the kindle fire hd. I was playing dead trigger and I did not see any frame drop and overall enjoyable game. played mass effect infiltrator, asphalt 7 ($.99), shadowgun, and they were running fine. i will try later FPSE see how that goes.Display=======================I like the display colors pop and I like reading a lot on the screen. There is a lot of reflection with sun light so that kind of spoils the fun.  The movies look great on the display no problems here. Also games look really nice on the kindle fire hd. Overall I like the display.Holding volume down + power button at the same time takes a picture of your display.I kind of like the carousel but If could I would want my apps to just show on the main screen like normal android.  I just don't see the point to carousel.  But whatever the case adw launcher ex  is always there.Battery========================The battery last a long time.  I did not mind that they gave us a mini usb cable for the for the kindle fire hd. I used by hd2 charger for the kindle fire it charges fine and fast enough for me.  Why can't customers have the choice to change their own battery? The hp was like this, also the nexus 7.  Why are they copying apple?Sound=================Wow sound is legit on this device. Really loud. Overall really impressed on the sound. Headphone is really good too. Sound is not a problem. 5 stars.  No much to say other than amazon did it right.Camera================Camera is ok , its just whatever.  It nice that it is there. I downloaded from android market camera ics and you can take pictures and videos from the app.  Can control zoom in functions with the apps, also share via Bluetooth, and email via Gmail.Bluetooth================It limited to what it can connect. I could not connected to my ps3 Bluetooth headset.  I could not make it connect to my computer which had a Bluetooth usb. So I guess I ll need to find some devices and meeting the requirements of the KFHD7.Ads==========Ads don't bother me, but I wish they were maybe related to what I liked. But If I feel like they are in my way, since I am already rooted then I remove them manually. Was actually really funny I was showing off my kindle fire hd to someone, and as soon as I turned the kindle there was big titanic advertisement as my lock screen picture, so it was really awkward, I was like uhhhh  yeah I don't like titanic.  Maybe some gamer advertisements would be nice. Xbox 360 or ps3 gaming advertisements.Apps that work after rooting=============================Youtube  v4.1.23Gmail  v4.1.2Google earth 7.0.0.7386Google maps v6.12.0Google talkGroove ip liteCamera icsAutocad ws (looked really good on the kindle fire hd) for any engineers out thereDead trigger ( can play now with ps3 controller)Graph 89 free (like having a ti 89 titanium  but with color )Mass effect infiltratorShadow gun ( can play now with ps3 controller)N64oid (nintendo 64 emulator ( can play now with ps3 controller))Sixaxis controller now I can use my ps3 controller with kindle fire hdDice player to watch avi movies.Adw launcher ex works but if you hit home button it reverts back to the carouselAny app you can think of from the android storeOverall===========All I can say is that I like my kindle fire hd.  I really like that I put some physics books, math books, engineering books, carry them all and read on that nice display. I can then use an app like graph 89 and upload ti 89 titanium operating system on app, it kind of replaces my actual ti 89 titanium. I load some games and so far I like playing games with my ps3 controller. i watched rango, true grid, iron man 2, defiance, mission impossible, and all can say is I like the display and the sound. The performance is great but not perfect. Bluetooth left something to be desired. Rooting the device opens a lot of doors.  I would recommend the device; I would rate it over all 4 stars.  You get a free month of amazon prime.  I think I ll get the amazon prime membership was using my brother one.other notes============as jsh1120 pointed out rooting the device does void your warranty unless you can revert (in some cases you can). please research before doing anything. the youtube tutorial is fairly simple to follow, but if you have never rooted a device before this might be challenging.****Rooting the device will NOT kill your amazon prime instant video streaming capabilities******* amazon prime video streaming is working fine after rooting, i am watching my free movies just fine.update 10/6/2012=================i bought a mini hdmi to hdmi, the kindle fire hd looks really good on the tv, it amazing, i was able to play some n64 games with the ps3 controller in the big tv. brought some nostalgia memories.search youtube ""kindle fire hd Rooted with google apps"" i uploaded this video showing what kindle can do, please note is laggy because i was recording through vnc, and i had no camera.

I thought long and hard before I gave it only three stars. But, despite it being better than any other compact, I still have lots of criticism.The good:The image quality is very strong. Not as good as the DP1/2, but that camera is a disaster in nearly all other regards. With F/2 and and 400 you'll likely get the indoor shot you need. And when that fails, 800 is tolerable. The LX3 is a zippy performer too. While a little slow on the startup, the auto-focus is decently quick (could be better) and the shot to shot performance is quite good. The full-auto mode is good too. Hand the camera over to a novice and he/she will get a good shot. Love the aspect ratio.The meh:The zoom range is a little limited. But I'm not too bothered by it. Other than macro, I can't imagine the manual focus ever being usable. I'd gladly give up some screen real estate for a viewfinder (even an evf). An integrated lens cap would have been a nice touch, as would a wrist strap. It'd be nice if the RAW format were more open. At the time of this review Aperture doesn't support it at all and Lightroom only kinda supports it.The bad:My main complaint is the interface. It's not awful. In fact it's probably better than most compacts. But this camera had so much manual potential, only to be let down my too many darned buttons. The user programable setting are a good example. It has four presets. But only two of them are really useful. The other two require you to turn the dial, hit the select button, navigate down and then confirm; you just missed your shot. I wonder why it would be so difficult to have two or three more dials on the camera to control shutter, aperture and ISO? Instead, we get the worlds tiniest joystick. Again, by the time you've actually changed a setting you probably missed the shot. Also, why is a manual focus that goes around the lens so hard to implement? It's such a wonderful convention that is almost never seen on a compact.The wrap up:I do really like this camera. It's a good RAW shooter with good quality; all in a compact package. But, I hope that Panasonic really concentrates on the fundamentals for the LX4. A viewfinder and a couple of dials or knobs would have made this a four star camera for sure. If they managed to squeeze a larger sensor in too, it would be the best camera of all time.The unrelated:Shame on Amazon for allowing price gouging from their partners. Currently (April/May 2009) the LX3K is quite scarce. I ended up paying a reasonable $50 over MSRP. But during the shortage the camera has been on sale for as much as $750 ($250 over MSRP!). Capitalism, the free market and supply/demand are all good things. But I'm a little offended that Amazon would allow their customers to be bludgeoned by such heavy pricing.

Just decided to use new 9500ix for the trip in a car. I originally picked up the unit for use on a motorcycle. On the way it picked up traffic light cameras as well as K Band and regular radar. I noticed a number of patrol cars parked in plain sight on the center median perpendicular to the traffic lanes. Thought it kind of funny that I never had a peep from the detector for one of these cars. On the way back I found out why. Bingo a speeding ticket and never heard any type of warning from the detector. Laser!!! This thing does not pick it up. I'm sure it a good unit for conventional Radar but that is becoming obsolete. I would wait and buy a unit that is designed for the new wave of laser that will be in wide spread use and will replace Radar in the near future. Unfortunately, while the company claims that the unit offers some protection against laser I have not had it make any sound or warning whatsoever. So, I have to give the product an F.It seems like more and more law enforcement are going to laser. This is old school technology. It may work ok for regular radar and has a lot of bells and whistles some which you have to pay added subscription charges for.

Living in Texas means a base temperature indoors of about 80F for much of the year and I've had some bad issues with overheating and crashing on my previous rig when playing games.Installation on an Intel based mainboard was painless (AMD looks slightly more intimidating from the manual). In fact, it was not harder than installing a stock cooler and absolutely nothing when compared with the complexity of traditional waterbased cooling systems. It comes with pre-applied thermal paste that does the job just fine, although I suspect you could get even better cooling results with high end thermal paste. The H100 installs very conveniently in the case and does not clutter up the interior at all, which I consider a definite plus.The cooling performance of the product is excellent, and better than what Corsair advertises on the box. The difference to the stock cooler that came with my processor is dramatic, double digit degrees on all settings. The H100 has three speed settings for the fans controlled via a button located on top of the part attached to the CPU. Unless you have an easily accessible case, you will likely not be changing fan speeds very much. There's apparently an additional hardware product that can be used to control the fans from an optional front panel, but I have not found it necessary to change speed away from the minimum setting unless I seriously overlock my CPU.The noise profile of the device is great, but certainly not silent, as long as it is not set to it's maximum speed setting.Some words of caution: This cooler requires some serious space and there are not many cases on the market that will work with it outside the box. On my Level 10-GT gaming case installing it meant removing one of the 210mm fans that came preinstalled to allow installation of this one. Do yourself a favor and do some research if your case has space for the H100 (The grill slightly larger than the 2 fans attached to it).Bottom line: Excellent cooler, comparatively easy installation, decent noise profile. Easiest water-cooling solution I've ever installed. Acceptable price. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2158, 2172)",1,0.0,False

Wireless configuration was a breeze. Was using Netflix in just a few minutes. Netflix works extremely well. Seemless kick ask video performance. It also offers Vudu. Didn't know what this was so I gave Vudu a try. Kick ask. I didn't know HD could be streamed over the internet so well. Movies look great on Vudu and so easy to use through the BD390. When I show Vudu to other people I get confused looks. ""Your Blu-ray player is going on the internet? Huh.""I was not impressed with the music playing via the USB port. There is no shuffle; not even within a single folder. And then when you get to the end of the last file in a folder, instead of continuing to play the first file on the next folder, it just stops. Not kick ask. Lame. I can fit my entire music collection on a 4 GB USB stick, so I intend to use the BD390 to listen to music with the USB and not use CDs. These limitations on USB play back are lame.I have to hand it to blu-ray player makers on how much stuff they are jamming into these small and afforable boxes. There are billions of formats (both audio and video) and media types to deal with. Really amazing. But you know, I once bought a $49 DVD player that could remember the stopped position of the last 5 DVDs played. So if you ejected the DVD and then re-inserted it, it could continue playing where you left off. I have yet to see a blu-ray player offer this feature, but near the climax of DVD player feature advancement, many DVDs offered this feature. This is a very usefull feature if disk switching occurs before finishing them. So to some degree, I'm poo-pooing all blu-ray players until I see this commonly available DVD feature on blu-ray players. Skip the non-kick ask BD Live. I can really care less about BD Live, but I'm sure thousands of hours of engineering development went into it.-- Begin Update 11/29/2009 --I just realized the BD390 can remember the stopped position of blu-rays even if you eject the disc. The manual is very unclear about this feature. Manual seems to indicate it does not work for all discs. Only tried with one disc, so don't know how many stop positions it can store. The $49 DVD player refered to above could store five.-- End Update 11/29/2009 ---- Begin Update 12/10/2009 --OK, the assessment of whether the BD390 can remember the stopped position is still unclear. I have had several disks now that don't even remember their stopped position even if you do not eject the disk. So, in other words, I'm leaving the disk in, but just stopping play and powering down the BD390. When I power the BD390 back up, the disk left in starts back up with the trailers and goes to menu. Not kick ask. I don't know why with the 11/29/2009 update above it remembered the position with that disk and other do not. When I did the test on 11/29, I did not power down the unit; just ejected and reloaded. With the last few disks, even if eject and reload without powering down, they still don't remember stopped position. So it seems the functionality is hit and miss here. I'm hoping LG sees this as a problem and offers a firmware update.-- End Update 12/10/2009 ---- Begin Update 6/2/2010 --It appears that LG has fixed the hit and miss problem of remembering the stop position of a disc. With the latest firmware update, the player remembers where a disc was left.-- End Update 6/2/2010 --The picture quality is great with the BD390. It is not clear from the marketing, but this blu-ray will upconvert DVDs to 1080p. DVDs look great. The BD390 can also output either 24 or 60 Hz video. If you intend to have the HDMI AND component video hooked up, then component video can only output 480i. Otherwise, if HDMI is not hooked up, component video can output 1080i. HDMI can of course output 1080p.The front display is not kick ask. No way to see the remaining time on a movie or even the duration of a movie through menu options. And when playing USB music, you have to have the TV on. You just cannot navigate the folders without looking at the TV. All you see is the time of play on the front display. I think they could have managed to get the display to show folder and file information on the display. My car stereo can do it. Take away a few thousand hours of development on BD Live and improve the display on the unit. Also, MP3 files only show the file name on TV. It does not read the MP3 metadata tag information, which is really better for getting the artist and song title.One thing that is really kick ask is how the BD390 does firmware updates. You may say, ""Who cares."" Well you should. How long do you expect to keep your BD390? Do you really think Netflix Watch Instantly will remain the same service in the next five years or so? Will Vudu even still be in business? Well, interfaces to these services will evolve over time. New services could become available. The BD390 will need firmware updates to keep up. If you have ever done a firmware update on a non-internet enabled blu-ray player, you know it is a pain in the ask. You have to download from the internet the updated firmware, burn to a CD, then insert in player and turn unit on. The BD390 checks for updates when you turn it on. If it determines there are updates, it asks you if you want to do the update. It then goes on the internet, downloads the new firmware, and then installs it. Very painless. Totally kick ask.So I have nit-picked a bit, but over all, the BD390 is kick ask. Netflix is just awesome.-- Begin Update 12/16/2009 --I have since down graded my rating to 4 stars. This Blu-ray player has since locked up twice. Once when doing stuff with the set up menus. Another time when just turning the TV on while it was playing music. When you turn on the TV, something goes on with the HDMI. Somehow this caused it to freeze and I had to shut it off and turn it back on. Combined with the hit and miss stop position memory (which is a defect in my opinion since it is inconsistent), and now these freezes, I cannot justify a five star rating anymore.-- End Update 12/16/2009  -- ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(6060, 6074)",2,0.0,False

I would prefer if they were a little better built, but they're acceptable for the price. The fabric used on the ear pieces and the head padding is the same fabric they use in fabric lint rollers. It's soft enough, but collects lint accordingly. The mic boom is flexible rubber and decent quality, but it doesn't allow you to adjust its location in and out and sits further from the mouth than expected.Pros:Sound - The sound quality is very decent. I'm not an audiophile so take it with a grain of salt, but both games and music are quite enjoyable for me with this headset.Comfort - At first I found these uncomfortable and pinching which after an hour of use caused significant discomfort. However, once I lowered the ear pieces to wear this a bit loose (more loose than I normally prefer headphones) they fit much better. After hours of use they are still comfortable for me.Microphone - The mic is very sensitive and picks up sound really well.Cons:USB - The USB interface is one you want to avoid for headsets if you have a good soundcard. USB headsets include their own audio card built-in to the device in order to work. Therefore, using these will bypass the soundcard in your computer.  Also, the USB cable is quite short. This device isn't compatible with USB 3.0. Since I only have 3.0 on the front panel of my computer I would prefer a longer cord to run it from the back.Dolby - The simulated 7.1 is not appealing to me. It simulates surround by making the audio more `spatial'. This doesn't add to the audio quality though; it makes the sound worse in my opinion. The default setting is off,Volume Control - The volume control is a rocker switch in a convenient location on the back of the left ear-piece. The rocker switch is annoying. You rotate and hold it in one direction or the other to change the volume. I would prefer a dial instead of holding a switch.No Audio Controls - This device has no equalizer to adjust the audio. The audio levels it ships with is okay, but if you wanted to customize your sound you should purchase a different headset.Microphone - The mic is overly sensitive and even on low input volumes it picks up any background noise like you mouse and keyboard, breathing, etc.In summary, decent sound and comfort for the price, but has some limitations.

Turns out, they're all correct.When I first bought the Image S4's at a local best buy, they sounded ""pretty"" good out of the box, but they also sounded pretty painful in certain frequency ranges -- in the treble most notably. ""S"" and ""ch"" sounds in lyrics would punch my ears in the face and make me wince. Songs had a certain shrilling tinny quality to it, that was definitely not comfortable. Well, I left the S4's on my desk plugged into my Zune HD overnight, playing music at random. About 18 hours later, I can already hear a massive appreciable difference in the sound quality. The treble has softened back to a beautiful balance with the mids, no more shrilling pain from lyrics, and the bass has solidly found its place without trying to overpower the whole track. At lower volumes, the bass, mids, and treble are easily audible and full -- which was not the case before, where the bass would drop out, and the treble would overpower the mids.My opinion on the S4's went from ""If things don't improve, I will return them,"" to ""FOUND A KEEPER HERE."" -- And that's only with about a three-quarters of a day worth of burn-in! Most people recommend at least two to three days worth of burn-in to get the truly wonderful sound these headphones are capable of producing. I'm interested to see just how much they'll get from here in the coming hours.Elsewhere, the S4's fit my ears superbly. The oval tips on the buds fit perfectly into my canals. I don't get any discomfort from the build of pressure as I push them in -- the design seems to allow excess air to escape very well. This also means that then I put them in, I've yet to hear the speaker ""crinkle."" The other nice part about the oval design is that if I pull the muscles around my ear to make my ear stretch upward, the seal on the buds are not lost, which always happened on my old Lenntek Sonix. I would have preferred to have seen a braided cord on these, and the buds made from milled aluminum billets to really add some durability value to these, but they're quality isn't lacking as-is. The cord feels a bit thin, (not weak, just thin,) but at least klipsch added some of the best stress-relief shielding I've seen on a pair of buds. You won't see your cable weaken and drop signal on these for a long, long time -- if ever.I've trusted Klipsch before to impress me with my choice of desktop / entertainment center speakers, so when it was time to get new headphones, I thought I would place trust on them again -- and sure enough I'm not disappointed.

Actually, I didn't have to install any software - I had it installed for the VX Revolution - so the Control Center automatically recognized the new mouse with no problems.Not many downsides.  This mouse takes two AA batteries rather than just one - not sure why that is.  There is an on/off switch on the bottom if you want to save batter life.  And, like every mouse I've ever owned, the feet pick up a lot of dust and such from the desk.  No worse than any other mouse.  I'll have to wait a year or two to see if this lasts longer than the VX mouse.  And, of course, never happy paying $50 for a mouse..So happy camper here.  Very very happy with the M705, and would highly recommend it. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2508, 2522)",1,0.0,False

Before we got this lens, we usually carried three lens:Canon EF 17-40mm f/4L,Canon EF 50mm f/1.4and sometimesCanon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS II, and we paired them with our camera:Canon EOS 5D Mark II. So you can imagine how heavy is our backpack. We hope this lens can replace the other three lenses, such that it can cover landscape (24-35mm), portrait(50-85mm), and some wildlife at short distances (105mm). We understand that the quality may be sacrificed a little bit and may not be comparable to three other lens. We didn't expect that the difference is so big.We compared the image quality of this lens with the following lens. Notice that all images were shot at the same aperture/focal length. Also the scores below are relative/pair-wise.Candidate #1:Canon EF 17-40mm f/4L, Shoot at f/4 and 24mmBoth lens give similar result. However, I notice that 24-105 have some vignette issues (dark corner) at 24mm. Also, the image is not as sharp as 17-40.If the score of 17-40mm is 100, then this lens is 80.Candidate #2:Canon EF 50mm f/1.4, Shoot at f/4 and 50mmThe 50mm lens blows this lens away. The color of 24-105mm looks just weird at this focal length, and the image is not sharp (I want to say poor).If the score of 50mm is 100, then this lens is 50.Candidate #3:Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS II, Shoot at f/4 and 105mmWe did some portrait shots at 105mm. Surprisingly, the difference is reasonable and not too big. Similar to other tests, sharpness is an issue.If the score of 70-200mm is 100, then this lens is 70.ConclusionThis lens behaves okay in its shortest/longest focal length (i.e., 24mm and 105mm), and the image quality degrades at around 50mm. In fact, this is not the only lens having trouble with this problem. Other lens such asCanon EF 24-70mm f/4.0L ISalso performs poorly at 50mm. However, this was fixed in Canon EF 24-70mm f/2.8.Overall, the sharpness is a really big issue comparing to our collections. Although this lens offers a very attractive focal range, especially for hikers like us, we found that this lens is not a good fit for us because image quality matters than the weight of the lens.Suggestions:If you are using full-frame body, try to get aCanon EF 24-70mm f/2.8L II, Canon EF 24-70mm f/2.8L I, or Canon EF 24-70mm f/4.0L.If you are using crop-sensor body, don't waste your time with this lens. This lens is optimized for full-frame body. Try to get a higher-end EF-S lens such asCanon EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 ISinstead.Update (5/2/2014)I ended up selling my copy and get a copy of 24-70mm. Now I couldn't be happier. Many people are undecided whether they should get a 24-105mm (around $700), or they should buy a 24-70mm a f/4($1500), or even f/2.8 ($2300). Let's take the f/4 one as example. It is similar to 24-105mm (same aperture, with IS) except that its focal length is shorter (70 vs 105), and it costs nearly twice more expensive ($1500 vs $700). It doesn't make sense for Canon to make a more expensive and less powerful product. The difference obviously is image quality. Remember one thing: You get what you paid for.Further reading:I highly recommend to compare the image quality using the tools developed by The-Digital-Picture.com. You can easily find the link by searching ""Canon Review"" on Google. Go to Tools --> Image Quality and try to play around with different lens, aperture and focal length. That will give you the best side-by-side comparison. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3430, 3444)",2,0.0,False

There is no noise or distortion at high volume levels. The sound is clear and easy to understand (I use it to play documentaries).So, I needed something portable and loud, and this fits the bill perfectly. It also comes with a carrying case, which has a small pocket to hold the power adapter and remote. Speaking of the remote, it's not as sensitive as I expected it to be. Because it's IR-based instead of RF, you have to point it directly at the front of the speaker unit. It's not really a big deal, and it's better than no remote at all I guess.The only other similar option (AC powered and rechargeable battery) from Logitech isZ515 Wireless Speaker, and while I have not tried those speakers, I would think the extra iPod port in S715i makes these a little more valuable.Overall, I highly recommend these if clear audio, loudness, and portability are important to you.

Setup was quick and easy. Getting my browser to work with it took a little more fiddling, but that's just because I didn't want my work email associated with my youtube etc... nevermind. Anyway, Chromecast works basically as promised. It's sort of neat that I can pull up a youtube video on my phone or tablet or computer and get it playing on my big screen.It was apparent right away though that the image was cropped on my screen. I'm running a 1080p stream to a 1080p screen, and don't have this issue with my PS3, Xbox, Blu Ray player, or Boxee or Roku. I streamed my screen as well, and sure enough it wasn't a true representation of my laptop screen. Didn't matter what I streamed from either - I tried doing so from my phone, and the youtube video was cropped on all sides - looked zoomed in. I played around with my tv settings, and it didn't fix the issue. There's no settings to be found for fixing it either.Even zoomed in, it was a nice quick way to send youtube to my tv (even though I have other methods) - it's easily the fastest way considering the time it takes to fire up other devices. Hulu was also zoomed in, and the performance was choppy. I noticed I had to have the video playing in my laptop at the same time and I couldn't close the lid on my laptop. If I went full screen, Hulu would show full screen on my tv, but I couldn't do anything else with my laptop. The video on my laptop was not synced with the video on the screen. So if I want to watch hulu and do other stuff with my laptop, I have to watch it in the browser window which you can see on the tv screen rather than full screen. Full screen crops the video anyway though like I said, so there's really no good way to watch hulu I don't think. Unless I'm missing something.Netflix had the same issue as Hulu with the cropping and full screen. Youtube didn't have the full screen issue where I couldn't do anything else with my laptop... just the cropping.This is a decent little device for the price, but I probably won't use it for much besides youtube streaming. I'd say for what it costs, if you plan to only use it to stream Youtube, it's worth the money. Otherwise, save your hdmi port for something better. If I had a time machine, I would probably not buy it again since I don't really need it. In fact, I may relegate it to the bedroom tv that never really gets used.

That's $100 per meter. That's as much as forty foot longs at Subway, or a 1994 Ford Aspire. My videophile friend tells me that high-priced HDMI cables are better than cheap ones, since it's expensive to make 99.99% deoxygenated wire, which apparently prevents degradation of the signal.Who knew that oxygen degraded a digital signal? Too much oxygen also probably destroys the Higgs bosons in the cheap HDMI cable, which is probably why I cannot view my Blu-rays in the 2160P that my videophile friend's expensive HDMI cable allows.

So I almost ordered it but then I suddenly realized that the cable was more expensive than my TV by a magnitude of almost 10.  I went for the BlueRigger cable instead.

The cinema view (no frame around the edge of the screen) is very nice, and everyone who sees it notices it right off the bat and makes a complimentary comment.The colors are fantastic, and clarity, too.  One problem with this is that you can TOTALLY tell when a television show is not filmed in true HD (ie 720p instead of 1080p)...so not all ""HD"" channels are truly HD...The remote interface is cool.  Very much like the Wii, it's a point and click, as in you get an arrow that moves around and like a wand, you just aim and click.  There are many apps, including Hulu and Hulu Plus, etc. (They are listed above, so I won't bore you.)  Be aware, if you do not have very high speed internet service, you will have trouble with streaming HD movies.Setting up the WiFi is easy.  Just follow the directions and be sure your router is set to ""pair"".  Be sure you have the WPA code available, too.The sound is great--and I LOVE the option to amp up voices.  I have a problem with my hearing and cannot hear mid-range tones (voices).  I have always had trouble with normal TV's.  Not this one.  Awesome.Watching movies is clear, and the 2D-to-3D feature works amazingly well!  (Better than the new Titanic movie, I can tell you that...the one they just redid in 3D...)  I'm impressed!The 3D movies make you want to reach out and touch someone.  Really.The glasses are really nice!  They are light and you don't realize they are on after awhile.  Unlike the old-school 3D TV's, you don't need batteries.  And getting 6 pair is a super deal.I left it on for hours, to see if it got hot (like some other TV's do).  It did not.  Very nice.Now, the bad...(Yup, there's bad...and no matter what I did, I couldn't get around it.)The black depth could be better.  It's more like dark gray.  I turned off the backlight (it's annoying to me) and still I don't get the depth I'd expect from a TV.When the TV shows a black (yes, dark-gray, but for all intents it ""thinks"" it's black) you see various halos around the screen's edge.  At first there was just one.  Now there are 6.  I called customer service, and they were NOT HELPFUL at all.  I had the TV for a day and called, and still they tried to blame it on using HDMI cables, instead of the supplied component cables.  I switched to component, and the halo was still there.  I switched back and it didn't change.  Nothing to do with cables.  I googled it and it seems that this is a common problem.  But LG threatened to charge me if I asked someone to come check it out.  Not cool.  Even when I told them that I was reviewing it here, they didn't seem to care.Obviously, I am not going to pay to have someone come out...So, the bottom line is that it's a great TV, but not perfect.  If you're into deep colors, you have to really play with it to get it, and still your blacks could be better.  The halos drive me batty, but not enough to get rid of the TV.  They do not show up when there is an actual show on--only when it's a black screen, like the menu or when you turn the cable box off and you get the blank screen.The voice-option makes it a winner to me.

Probably would be a good primary router as well, but I use it as a range extender. I now get 3 bars downstairs where I used to get zero signal, and 4 bars out on the deck.I wish I could say the set up was easy, but because my wifi router is 7 years old and was set to WEP security it wasn't the simplest to get it to work. I had to call tech support. Thankfully the woman was incredibly helpful. She walked me through switching my router's security type to WPA and then the set up for the Almond Securifi was a breeze. So if you've got a newer main router to begin with, or at least one not using outdated security types, you'll probably just plug it in, click on the signal from your current router in the list, enter your router password, then wait 30 seconds for the Almond to do the rest. You'll then see a graphic showing the connection and can just direct your devices to the new signal instead of the old one. She was also going to show me how to merge the listings for the two signals, so that only one would show instead of ABC and ABC_almond, but I actually prefer seeing the two separate.I love that you can visually see the connection, and that each morning when I plug both devices in again, since I unplug both devices overnight (don't want to expose myself to more electromagnetics than necessary), within just seconds it finds all its settings and there are those green visuals showing the connection again.

I've used it for one day on my PC at work and the rest of the time at home on my Mac, running OS 10.6 Snow Leopard.  In both Win and Mac OS, i had instant functionality when i plugged in the mouse.  The special buttons don't start working until after you install the Logitech software, but basic point and click stuff works fine, which was nice.Compared to my Apple Mighty Mouse, this thing is nice because it works the instant you turn on the mouse.  No waiting for bluetooth to sync with the computer, etc.  I installed the mouse drivers on both platforms and not surprisingly, they ""feel"" different.  For example, i like the simplicity and look of the the Mac version of the driver.  There is a BUT here though....  In the Win version, the forward/backward buttons can be easily set as... forward and backward buttons for a browser.  The Mac version has no such default, and i had to tell it to do a keystroke instead, which still accomplishes the same thing.  It's not a huge deal, but a pretty odd omission for something that should be rather obvious.  Not everyone out there knows the keyboard commands for forward/backward.  Wish they made this a bit more foolproof.The feel of the mouse is very good, but i have medium/large hands.  If you have small hands, this mouse will feel huge.  You might consider other Logitech products if that's the case.  It is a very ergonomic shape and i find it comfy.  I love the thumb rest/button.  They got this one right.  It's hard enough to press that it doesn't fire off accidentally, but also doesn't require tons of pressure to activate.  I use it on my Mac to do Expose, but it could be programmed to do anything.  The Windows version of the driver has an Expose-like feature, but it's not nearly as nice as the Mac OS version of it.  Perhaps Windows 7 will have cooler visuals.All in all, the buttons feel pretty good, except for the scroll wheel.  The scrolling is fine, but does seem a bit clunky for a ""top shelf"" mouse such as this.  It feels clunky and sounds that way, too.  If you need a mouse that scrolls quietly, this isn't it.  My logitech keyboard/mouse combo my work has feels better in the wheel department.  The middle button is what really blows on this mouse.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  Sometimes i apply moderate pressure to the wheel and the middle button works.  Other times i feel like i'm going to break the mouse to get it to work.  For this reason, i reprogrammed the ""zoom"" button just below the forward/backward buttons to be my middle button.  I had no use for the zoom, so it works out well.  The zoom button has a great feel.  So, if you just simply can't live with a mouse that has a crappy middle button, you may want to look elsewhere.  Everything else i felt was well put together and seems to work well.  I tend to use the middle button for Google SketchUP, as it's used for panning the 3D model.  It has other uses, which are probably not important to the vast majority of users.  Heck, on a Mac, Apple used to think ONE button was enough on a mouse.  Silly Steve....  I now have 7 buttons and it all works pretty darn well.I think most people will find this mouse very nice and probably worth the cost.  The new ""unifying receiver"" is just freaking tiny!  The receiver is smaller than the USB plug it's attached to.  It just disappears underneath my aluminum Apple keyboard.  Range on the receiver is good also.

I've tried Cyber Acoustic products against Logitech and Altec Lansing, and these speakers are by far the best in their category.Firstly, the satellite tower design includes two speakers per tower, which helps distribute sound over a greater area than with single speaker designs. This greatly improves the listening experience, as the ""sweet spot"" area has widened so listeners perceive full-sounding stereo from a variety of locations in a small room. Additionally this avoids the pitfalls of ""small"" computer speakers which sound small, like music playing from a tin box. (the CA speakers 1 level below these with a single speaker design by comparison sound MUCH worse).Secondly, the bass and speakers are very powerful for their size, and have little to no distortion even at full-volume.The sub-woofer volume is adjustable independently of the other speakers. This lets you boost bass for music genres with a lot of low-frequency sounds, such as electronic/dance or hip-hop/rap, and likewise decrease bass for genres like classical and acoustic where the bass could overwhelm the instruments or vocals.The cord is conveniently long ans contains a circular volume control with a headphone jack and aux input.NOTE: I have two of these speaker systems because a roommate dropped a satellite speaker and broke the plastic foot. They are plenty sturdy if you respect them and should last a long time if handle them carefully. I guess that also shows how good these speakers are, that they broke and I bought them again.I'm a recording enthusiast, and these speakers satisfy my needs. They are not studio monitors but it's definitely possible to create good mixes on them. They take up considerably less space than professional studio monitors and are hundreds of dollars cheaper, but the sound quality is not significantly worse than monitors I've tried. They are easily 10x better than integrated speakers in TVs, laptops, etc. and they are a few steps above every speaker set in the less than $70 price range.

I bought 3 of these drives mainly because I was getting tired of using external hard drives that required their own power supply, and like the idea of a portable, USB powered backup.I've had WD drives before and not experienced any issues with them (I've got a couple of their 'powered' drives).  But these little buggers have been frustrating!ALL 3 WORK independently.  No issues there.  The trouble begins when you try to daisy chain and use more than one at a time!  A single 2TB drive was not going to be enough, so the plan was to link these together using a powered hub.My system:  HP 19"" laptop, running windows 7, 64 bit.  4 GB RAMHow I prepared and set up the drives:1 - The drives are ready to go out of the box.  The cables that come with them are PATHETICALLY SHORT.  About a foot long.2 - For each drive, I plugged them in one at a time and went into the properties to give them a unique drive name as to not confuse the computer, and keep them straight in windows explorer.  To keep it easy, I named them ""My Passport 1"", ""My Passport 2"", and ""My Passport 3"".  (I get the same problem I am about to describe if I have spaces in the name, or not)3 - To link them together, I made use of the following:a - HDE 2 Port USB 3.0 54mm Express CardB0046XUMDWb - Anker USB 3.0 7-Port Hub with 36W Power AdapterB006TT91TWc - AmazonBasics USB 3.0 A-Male to A-Female Extension CableB008EQYRRY4 - I tested the cable (3c Above) first by plugging each drive into the female end, and the male end into the express card (3a above).  the drive spun up, computer recognized it with no issues.  All 3 drives checked out OK.5 - I then tested the powered hub (3b above).  Plugged it into the Express Card (3a above) directly, the other end into an outlet.  I plugged in each drive one at a time (tested individually)... no issues.  all drives recognized.6 - next, I tested the hub WITH the cable.  I plugged the cable (3c) into the express card (3a), then the Hub (3b) into the cable (3c), AC adapter into the outlet.  The PC recognized the hub with no issues.This is where it gets puzzling:7 - I plugged ""My Passport 1"" into the Hub (3b).  Little blue light on the hub came on.  The hard drive started to flicker, computer made the 'discovery' sound, and windows explorer opened showing the new drive, and it appeared as 'My Passport 1"" in the directory tree.  could access the drive with no issues.8 - I plugged ""My Passport 2"" into the Hub (3b).  Little blue light on the hub came on.  The hard drive started to flicker, computer made the 'discovery' sound, and windows explorer opened showing the new drive, and it appeared as 'My Passport 2"" in the directory tree.  could access the drive with no issues.9 - I plugged ""My Passport 3"" into the Hub (3b).  Little blue light on the hub came on.  The hard drive started to flicker, computer made the 'discovery' sound, AND THAT WAS IT.  windows explorer would not see the 3rd drive, yet the computer must, because you get the audio tone as you did with the first 2.  I clicked on the properties for the drivers; on 'manage'; checked in 'device manager' - no way on earth to get to the 3rd drive.  yet you can pick it up and feel it is running.I installed the software that came with the hub, rebooted after installing each drive, nothing seems to work.10 - I ruled out a bad drive by repeating the procedures above, but changing the order of the drives being connected to the hub.  I started with 'my passport 3' - fired up, recognized no problems (yet in #9 - the computer would see it based on the sound, but that was it).  plugged in 'my passport 1'.  it also fired up, computer recognized - windows explorer opened - good to go.  plugged 'my passport 2' into the hub, behavior was similar to #9.things I have not tried yet:  2 drives in the Express card and one drive into the onboard USB2 port, but what sense would THAT make?  all 3 USB 3.0 drives will boot individually with the hub, but no more than 2 of them.ANYONE else had this problem or have a solution?  you should be able to plug all 3 drives into the 7 port hub with no issues.  I can plug 2 drives into the hub, and then plug an older USB 2.0 drive into the hub, 2 thumbnail drives - all work in harmony.  but 3 WD 2TB drives?  haven't figured that one out yet ANSWERNOTFOUND",The cables that come with them are PATHETICALLY SHORT,"(755, 808)",1,0.3,False

If you have to have GPS, don't have a smart phone, and are unlikely to need this on-the-fly, I could recommend it. But not without reservation.The biggest problem I've had with it is that it takes FOREVER for the unit to acquire a signal when first turned on. It seems like the longer it's been off, the longer it takes to get a satellite signal, but I wouldn't swear to that. Sometimes, though, it takes ten or fifteen minutes, and if I'm actually trying to go somewhere, I very rarely have that long to wait.Once it does get the satellite, it works fairly well, though it's not super-intuitive. The touch screen isn't greatly accurate, but it works well enough. You definitely can't use it while you're driving, but, I mean, I guess you're not supposed to do that anyway.The maps are good and accurate, but the route is never the one I'd choose. This is true of all auto-mapping software, though, and just a problem with the genre.The screen is bright and easy to see, and the contrast changes automatically for day or night, which is nice. I can't figure out how to shut up the woman who gives the directions for more than a few minutes a time, which is the number one reason I've pretty much completely stopped using it.Again, most of these issues are with the genre itself, and this unit does perform well (other than the satellite thing), and seems reasonably priced for what you get.

Here's the basic rundown:* Pain-in-the-butt to install. For AMD it requires you to remove parts from your motherboard. It also requires access to the bottom/back of the motherboard, so make sure your case has a CPU access window!* Huge! It takes up a lot of space in your case. This thing is massive!* Loud. It's not a quiet cooling solution. It gets pretty loud. I've heard louder, but not many.* Effective cooling. While it's loud, big, and a pain to install, it does cool the CPU quite effectively and handles overclocking quite well.* Complete. Everything you need is in the box. You shouldn't need to get any extra parts.My opinion is that it's a good cooler with a lot of unfortunate negatives you'd expect for a CPU cooler of this kind. No, it's not as small, quiet, or efficient as liquid-cooling, but it's also less expensive and not as complex as liquid coolers.Advice: If you're on a budget but want to overclock, this is a good place to start. If you can spend a little more, and don't mind learning to hook up a different kind of CPU cooler, then look for liquid cooling solutions, instead.If you're not going to overclock this is more than you'll need, for sure.

I've had good luck with New Trent's stuff so I thought I'd give it a shot. I really like the fact that it doubles as a case (hence the clamshell) when closed up. The Blutooth keyboard pairs in a snap and works great. Love the added function keys (home button, etc.) and found the size more than comfortable to type on. I've had this on my ipad for a while. I thought this would be one of those things I'd use solely for travel but the truth is this case/keyboard has stayed on my iPad since I bought it. The matte finish is nice and I love that it's not emblazoned with stupid logos.  Doesn't add a lot of weight and I really like the adjustability of the screen angle. Battery life is pretty terrific, too. One other nice thing - I like being able to 'detach' the iPad and set that up as a separate piece from the keyboard. There are some other nice touches - the rubber feet, the fact that you can change from portrait to landscape. Once you remove the iPad from the arm, the hard plastic case stays with it so conceivably you could just travel with that. It's not perfect - I realized carrying it in my bag that it is just a little heavier than I would like. And it would be nice if the hinge had a ratchet action. But overall this is a really nice set up, and I've had experience with a number of these types of keyboards. All in all, I'm really happy with it. ANSWERNOTFOUND",Love,"(293, 297)",2,0.6,True

Considering the price, I feel like this is a no-brainer purchase if you enjoy streaming shows from Netflix, clips on Youtube, and/or movies out of Google's store.Setup was a little more complicated than I was expecting.  I have a dual-band router, both with the same hidden SSID.  The Chromecast has an option to enter in your hidden SSID so it seemed like there'd be zero issue.  Entered it correctly, verified, and it just couldn't find my network.  I went back and tried a few times, thinking I must have been fat-fingering a button.  No luck.  I un-hid my 5ghz SSID, tried connecting, no luck.  It only worked after exposing the SSID on both 2.4 and 5ghz bands before it would connect.  Somewhere on the device page it says it does work with 2.4ghz hidden SSIDs, and I may try re-naming that band and hiding the 5ghz again.  But I hear that's not actually too terrible a thing to break through if somebody's actually seeking to get in so I might not even worry about it.Anyway, once setup, it's worked great with my HTC One.  Finding content through Netflix, Google Play, and Youtube on your phone is so much more convenient and intuitive than searching on the apps on your TV, or 360, etc.  Basically - any box where you have to fumble with a remote to do searching and navigation, this is better than.  You kick off a movie/clip, cast it to your TV, and the phone is free to do whatever else you want while the content plays.  At any time you can get back into the casting app and pause/resume content.  Super slick.I tried out the casting extension on my chrome browser, and it works about like you'd expect.  You can cast a tab, and all content on that tab is sent to your TV.  Works reasonably well for me, and I can definitely see the use cases (photo sharing, watching things you can't get to through the other mediums you have).  I tried streaming a movie through my Amazon Prime account, and while it worked, the audio wasn't 100% synced up.  And of course if you want it full-screen, you have to give up your laptop while the movie plays.  Also - my laptop (retina MBP) got really hot, and really noisy.  My recommendation would be to not expect to use this feature on a regular basis for streaming content.One other downside I noticed is that while casting a netflix movie, the netflix screen takes up the entirety of my lock screen.  I received a phone call, and the phone was ringing but the caller information was missing, as were the 'Answer' and 'Ignore' buttons.  Had to ""back"" out of the netflix info (which is just weird on the lock screen to have to do) before they showed up.  Google Play Movies did not have this problem, yet still allowed you to pause/resume from the lock screen.Anyway - I really can't recommend this thing enough.  It isn't perfect, but it's also not expensive enough to expect perfection.  If you like Netflix, Youtube, and Google Play content to be on your TV, this is the easiest and cheapest way to get it there.  If you have other ways to get it there, this is still a worthy investment as it's infinitely more pleasing to use than a TV-remote based application.Very, very pleased.

I've always pressed spacebars as they were meant to be pressed so I had no issues adjusting.The largest challenge with this keyboard is using home row correctly, Microsoft puts out products based on the standard, and has done this with its' Natural line since the start. I use my left hand correctly, my right, on my Logitech Elite, went all over the place; I can only imagine how wrong my right hand usage was. This keyboard forces you to relearn typing, for typing classes, a Natural keyboard would be perfect, it makes you type correctly. I don't much like the N key, but I've learned to use it and the M key correctly, no more hitting my enter key while going for quotes either.The zoom function is novelty, not necessity, it's fun to use normally but mostly useless otherwise, really exclusively for the always-in-office user, what they need to do is make it a scroll button too, it's highly sensitive and easy to use, which would make scrolling silky smooth in a way only overpriced mice manage.Therein lies the problem, the software is inferior to my cheapie Logitech Elite(Which had more functions I might add as well as better software.), there is hardly any customization to be had. There is no taskbar icon; most of the remapping done is through an interface integrated into the already well-hidden Keyboard area under the control panel. Remapping options are less than fantastic, the favorites keys are useless, the back and forward buttons will work with either a browser or a media player, not both, zoom cannot be reconfigured, and Mail only allows one indicated program to be opened.This is what is wrong with the favorite's keys, they allow but five programs to be opened, you cannot indicate that you wish to open a menu of programs to select, merely one program per key, same with all of the other keys. The lack of ""My"" keys for the F# Buttons is annoying, but that's just a design decision for a non-media keyboard, and I don't mind much.This keyboard would've done better to have more configuration and just a couple more media keys, but I suppose it's my fault for asking that much of it, it's designed for the office, not a music listeners hands. I'll go into the aesthetics of this baby now to round it off.Some may notice the shift keys are smaller, and the enter key even smaller, the right of the keyboard is larger than the left in the way of keys, which seems fine, to me at least, I find reaching the Backspace key uncomfortable, placing your hands on this keyboard is like a match made in heaven, seems a shame to reach so far away and break off from paradise.That leads me to this palm rest, wow, sick of those cheap detachable plastic palm rests(Read: Wrist Destroyers)? This is your ticket, so soft, yet strong, it's the cashmere of palm wrests. The 2x3 layout is back to normal, which I very much enjoy, insert is back home and delete is too. The keys above the numpad offer more functions that I have yet to use, but are nice to have all the same, the curvature of the keys takes getting used to, particularly the aforementioned N key and it's sibling the M key. The Alt, Ctrl, Windows, Menu, and Start keys are all gigantic and hard to miss, they feel pretty great.The spacebar, apparently if struck correctly, is amazing, it's designed for this keyboard in a way that no spacebar has ever been, it's almost destructive of what you're typing looking down while you type, seeing it all functioning the way it does, it's almost like some kind of alien technology, which is why I don't look.The...crappy plastic attachment that comes attached(Oddly enough) to this masterpiece is best taken out(Easily) and forgotten, it's all personal preference of course, I didn't like it, the slope of the keys makes leaving your hands where they are painless and then very comfortable. The prop-ups on the back make it more conventional and I rather like them, but now the size.This keyboard is undeniably the largest keyboard I have ever laid eyes on, the sheer width and height is enough to make a laptop user gawk for moments at a time, it is critical you have a large amount of desk space to place this on, I didn't, and I had to move my entire PC over more to the left just to manage a nice cozy fit. When the legs on this baby are propped it also reaches monitor height, I.E., it will not fit very well under a monitor, which is why it is best used in a keyboard tray, though I'd worry about it's large scale hurting the tray after a long enough time.In conclusion, this is a masterful piece of hardware, and it has virtually no flaws, the software is pathetic at best and obviously designed for the dullard worker drone, it's a pity really, all the same, it deserves four stars, here's to hoping they manage to improve the boring, bland software.8/10 (Not an average) ANSWERNOTFOUND",it's highly sensitive and easy to use,"(1151, 1188)",1,0.8666666666666667,True

I haven't had a Sony console since the PS2 and my most recent console was the Xbox 360.  The console arrived on time for launch day and was a breeze to set up.  The Playstation Network (PSN) was more than a bit congested due to the massive number of accounts hitting it within the 24 hour launch day.I was able to set up my console and download the initial software update with no problems.  Getting my PSN account logged in took a bit of time, but that was to be expected given the high demand for the system and large network traffic.  Since I couldn't access the store from the console, I opted to use the nifty feature of purchasing a digital game through Sony's website and setting it to download to the PS4.  That bypassed the traffic and immediately started the download to the console.  The play while you download feature is nice, but be aware that you need to download a specified portion of the game before you can start.  With a retail size game, that still takes time.  My example was Battlefield 4.  6GB is necessary to start playing.  You can then play single player while the remaining 33GB downloads.The hardware itself is pretty great.  I love the simple design of the case and the power is a sufficient leap over the previous generation of consoles that it makes it worth it.  The DualShock4 controller takes a bit of getting used to if you have been using an Xbox controller, but it's a great controller.  I haven't used the touchpad yet, but it's a potentially interesting feature.  The triggers are different, but I think they are quite adequate for my primary gaming need - shooters.The user interface is simplistic, but everything seems sorted into logical areas.  I've only got about 8 hours into usage, so my experience is still that of a new user.Included in the box is a 30-day trial for PS+, which is required for online multi-player.  You also get some pretty great games free every month.  I already have a favorite launch game and it was free - Resogun.  There is also a 30-day trial of Sony's streaming music service.  I tested it out briefly and it works well, though I'm not sure I'd subscribe to it after the trial is up.The best part is that I was able to set up a PSN account for my wife so she can access everything I can but there is no fee for her account.  Also, Sony has not put any of the media streaming services not owned by Sony (Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Instant, etc.) behind a paywall.  This simplifies multiple accounts on the console accessing streaming media.Overall, I'm very satisfied with my purchase and I highly recommend a Playstation 4 to people looking at upgrading to a next-gen console.

Read ""Update"" at the bottom of this article.Fit and finish is great.  Fits on my D700 without issue and looks like it was made for it.  Controls work fine.  The Zeikos has a rubberized finish where you would grip it for portrait shots, which looks and feels just like the rubber on the D700.  Ergonomically it's very nice.  My only ergonomic issue is not with the grip, it's with the camera strap which tends to obscure the viewfinder when you turn the camera vertically.  But this would be an issue with the MB-D10 also.The holder for the EN-EL3 is flimsy; be very careful inserting and removing the battery in the plastic holder.  I don't know if it's possible to buy the holder separately if it breaks.  I don't want to find out.When using the AA battery pack, the Nikon D700 will fire at its maximum frame rate, which it won't do with the EN-EL3.  This is why I bought the product as I take a lot of action shots.The problem is, after using the AA battery pack for a few minutes, the D700 will throw an error and refuse to fire.  I get the same results using fresh non-rechargeables and freshly charged rechargeables.  So far I've been able to fix the issue by turning off the camera, removing the battery pack, removing the camera's battery, wait a few seconds, then reinsert the camera battery.  I had read that this product can fry your camera's electronics, which I believe is FUD by those who want to sell you the much more expensive Nikon MB-D10.  But it is disturbing that the camera errors when using the AA adapter.  I have not yet had an error when using the EN-EL3.This feature (using AA batteries and getting the faster cycle time) was highly desired but doesn't appear to be working.  Had this worked, the product would have gotten a higher score.I've heard that this grip will work with the en-el4a, but the cost of the battery (plus cover and battery charger) is so prohibitive that I've declined to do the experiment.Update:I'm changing my rating to 4 stars.  I'd change it to 5 stars if Zeikos releases an en-el4 end cap that exactly fits the grip.  (See below.)As mentioned in a reply to this article, I got it working with the AA battery pack by changing a setting in the camera.  You have to tell the camera what kind of AA batteries are in the grip.  I'm currently using Sony 2500 mAh ""CycleEnergy"" rechargeables, and they work fine, at the full 8 fps of which the D700 is capable.  I take action shots at horse shows, usually 700 -- 800 shots per show, mostly at full continuous speed, and a fully charged set of AAs will lose just one bar off the power meter after a day of shooting.  I've also noticed that the Sonys keep their charge at least as long as the Nikon batteries do.  I always charge up before a pro shoot, but for casual use I don't bother, and the batteries don't appreciably lose charge sitting in the bag.After four months of hard use, I've had absolutely no problems with this grip.  The rubber coating has not peeled off, there are no cracks or other stress signs, and the grip still attaches solidly to the camera.  I've used it handheld and mounted on a tripod with no problems.  It's been so convenient that I leave it on the camera.  (Which tells me I should have gotten a D3s instead of a D700 but that's another story.)I did finally spring for the en-el4 battery pack and the official Nikon endcap.  The battery pack works fine in the grip.  As others have noticed, the official Nikon end cap for the en-el4 does not fit exactly right on the grip.  There's a small gap in one spot.  It doesn't affect operation, and it's nowhere near your hand, but I would be concerned about weather sealing.  I'll use it in dry weather but will probably go back to the Zeikos battery pack when I have to shoot in inclement weather.  It's too bad Zeikos doesn't make an end cap that fits properly on this grip.  I'd buy one.I haven't done a lot of shooting yet with the en-el4, but a few tests show that I still get full continuous speed and the camera works flawlessly.Second update:I've owned this device 18 months now.  I thought I'd be taking it on and off the camera depending on whether I needed the vertical shutter, extra battery capacity or faster frame rate.  In practice, I keep the grip on the camera all the time.  It gives the camera a more solid feel, and I use the vertical controls a lot more than I thought I would.I now have two EN-EL4a batteries, and have had no problems using them in the grip.  I keep the AA adapter in my bag in case of emergency, but haven't needed in a long time.I shoot mostly action in outdoor settings, and my camera tends to see hard use.  The D700 has scars from being dropped, has part of the paint rubbed off from use, and the rubber on the body is starting to peel away in one spot.  You'd think this Chinese made knock-off grip would look even worse, but it is so far showing no significant signs of wear.  The rubber is still firmly attached, nothing has rubbed off with use and all the controls still work.I was a little anxious about buying this because of rumors that it would ""fry your camera"" or wouldn't hold up to field work, but I now have to admit, this is probably the best sixty bucks I have spent in a long time.  Here's hoping Zeikos manages to keep up this level of quality.Third update:I've had this grip for two years now.  It's rarely off the camera, and has seen heavy use with Nikon EN-EL4 battery packs.  (About 20,000 clicks during this time.)  It has taken a lot of abuse, including falling out of the car, and still works fine.  The only oddity I have noticed is that rarely (about five times in six months) the shutter release on the grip will stop working.  I *think* this happens when I swap batteries, but I haven't characterized the problem yet, mostly because it happens so rarely.  Turning the camera off, waiting a few seconds, and turning it back on, solves the problem.  My current theory is that it happens when I forget to turn off the power when swapping batteries, but don't know for sure yet.  Will update again if I find the root cause.I'm still really happy with this product.  I shoot in portrait mode a lot, and the vertical grip is very comfortable.  The build quality is excellent.

What Chromecast does is to cast ""cast-supported"" apps from your smart phones, tablets, and stream media from your laptops and PCs to the TV on the same local network (LAN).Setup is easy and straight-forward. Connect Chromecast to your TV, download Chromecast apps from Google Play / iTune to your device, making sure Wifi-is on, setup Chromecast's Wifi connection via your mobile device, and it is done. Setup only needs to be done once. Other supported devices connected to the same local network will then all be able to use the same Chromecast.Now Google Play has a section dedicated to Chromecast compatible apps. For some reason, this section is only shown via Google Play app, not browser version, but going to chromcast.com/apps would also give you the list. Currently the selection is quite limited, with a great deal of them just variations of apps for streaming media from your local computers and media servers to Chromecast. Others like YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, and so on frequently requires paid subscription to truly make a difference.Basically, Chromecast combines your mobile device and TV into a fast-response SmartTV.The Touch-Ups which could potentially make Chromecast a perfect device:Currently, the only way to cast PC Desktop screens onto Chromecasted TV is to download the Google Chrome extension ""Google Cast"" by Google (sorry, mobile Google Chrome is currently not supported). It gives your the option to stream a dedicated browser Tab or cast the entire desktop screen. However, there are some flaws:1. In general, casting would mess up your Google Chrome ""non-maxed"" window size. It is a mild annoyance, but still annoying anyhow.2. Tab cast mode has no option to display mouse cursor. Not an issue for portable laptops, but a serious issue for a casting PC from another room.3. Desktop cast mode does display mouse cursor, but it could only cast the whole desktop. If you have a multiple monitor setup, it practically makes the cast useless.4. Neither Tab mode nor Desktop mode have build-in PC control mechanism. Although this could be easily fixed by using app such as ""Unified Remote,"" it is still one extra step.*How 4. works, Google Cast to cast PC desktop + Unified Remote on your tablet/smart phone to control the PC -> result displays on TV**Better solution: Chomecast app integrates with Google Cast.

The earbuds fit well and the sound is very clear.  It also holds a charge through a solid 5 hours a day.  I would charge it at the end of every day, so not sure how much longer it would last if I kept using it.Cons:- Although it is very comfortable and easy to wear during active runs and gym sessions, it just feels flimsy to me.The little earbuds are supposed to be held onto the neckband with little magnets.  These magnets are far too weak and barely hold them in when they are stationary.  They are also not the easiest to fit in place while the neckband is still around your neck.If you do manage to fit them in, the slightest head movement causes them to fall out.This is not only frustrating, but with them just dangling there, they easily got caught on my jacket, shoulder strap of my purse and scarf.It was an accident waiting to happen and I just knew they'd get torn off one day soon.Another concern was how they'd hold up being toted around in bag.

Always at the forefront of computer-human relations has been the keyboard and mouse (at least in my lifetime). It's no surprise then to see just how many companies try year after year to perfect this interface.Microsoft's effort with the Wireless Desktop 3000 is a noble effort worthy of praise.So in a nutshell here is what I like:Keyboard:+ Very stylish looking.+ A subtle contour that feels just right when typing.+ They keys are a cross between a standard desktop and a laptop keyboard. The keys make a satisfying ""click-clap"" when typing.+ WIRELESS! Say goodbye to those messy wires and hello to a clean desktop!+ 2 extra USB ports freed up (thanks to the wonders of wireless technology)!+ Integrated wrist-rest made from a soft-rubbery type of material.+ Plenty of integrated and customizable shortcuts to everything from email, calculator and multi-media functions.Mouse:+ Again stylish looking - I'm a sucker for Blue LED's of any type!+ Rubberized grips on the sides of the mouse are very comfortable.+ Integrated ""back"" & ""forward"" buttons are placed perfectly.+ Scroll wheel is heavy and super-smooth.+ Clicking the scroll wheel brings up a super-cool way to switch between apps - think Alt+Tab but better looking.+ The BlueTrack technology in the mouse is supposed to work on just about anything but glass or mirrored surfaces. In my experience this is true - except of course I can't throw away my mouse pad just yet as I have a glass-top desk.There are a few things that I don't like:Keyboard:- The ""function"" keys are small and evenly spaced across the top of the keyboard. This makes finding a specific 'Fx' key challenging.- No back-lighting whatsoever - obviously to save power but still.- Installing the included software does add more functions but takes an absurd amount of time for install - think more than 15 minutes! This is a keyboard and mouse not anti-virus software!I was a bit worried when I read that this combo operates in the 2.4GHz spectrum. I run a wireless network in my home and can pick up 6 different networks in my area. My fears of interruptions have thus far been unfounded. Everything works swimmingly! The keyboard and mouse each take 2 'AA' batteries and I've been using the same rechargeable batteries in mine for the past 2 months without a hiccup.

Before we got this lens, we usually carried three lens:Canon EF 17-40mm f/4L,Canon EF 50mm f/1.4and sometimesCanon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS II, and we paired them with our camera:Canon EOS 5D Mark II. So you can imagine how heavy is our backpack. We hope this lens can replace the other three lenses, such that it can cover landscape (24-35mm), portrait(50-85mm), and some wildlife at short distances (105mm). We understand that the quality may be sacrificed a little bit and may not be comparable to three other lens. We didn't expect that the difference is so big.We compared the image quality of this lens with the following lens. Notice that all images were shot at the same aperture/focal length. Also the scores below are relative/pair-wise.Candidate #1:Canon EF 17-40mm f/4L, Shoot at f/4 and 24mmBoth lens give similar result. However, I notice that 24-105 have some vignette issues (dark corner) at 24mm. Also, the image is not as sharp as 17-40.If the score of 17-40mm is 100, then this lens is 80.Candidate #2:Canon EF 50mm f/1.4, Shoot at f/4 and 50mmThe 50mm lens blows this lens away. The color of 24-105mm looks just weird at this focal length, and the image is not sharp (I want to say poor).If the score of 50mm is 100, then this lens is 50.Candidate #3:Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS II, Shoot at f/4 and 105mmWe did some portrait shots at 105mm. Surprisingly, the difference is reasonable and not too big. Similar to other tests, sharpness is an issue.If the score of 70-200mm is 100, then this lens is 70.ConclusionThis lens behaves okay in its shortest/longest focal length (i.e., 24mm and 105mm), and the image quality degrades at around 50mm. In fact, this is not the only lens having trouble with this problem. Other lens such asCanon EF 24-70mm f/4.0L ISalso performs poorly at 50mm. However, this was fixed in Canon EF 24-70mm f/2.8.Overall, the sharpness is a really big issue comparing to our collections. Although this lens offers a very attractive focal range, especially for hikers like us, we found that this lens is not a good fit for us because image quality matters than the weight of the lens.Suggestions:If you are using full-frame body, try to get aCanon EF 24-70mm f/2.8L II, Canon EF 24-70mm f/2.8L I, or Canon EF 24-70mm f/4.0L.If you are using crop-sensor body, don't waste your time with this lens. This lens is optimized for full-frame body. Try to get a higher-end EF-S lens such asCanon EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 ISinstead.Update (5/2/2014)I ended up selling my copy and get a copy of 24-70mm. Now I couldn't be happier. Many people are undecided whether they should get a 24-105mm (around $700), or they should buy a 24-70mm a f/4($1500), or even f/2.8 ($2300). Let's take the f/4 one as example. It is similar to 24-105mm (same aperture, with IS) except that its focal length is shorter (70 vs 105), and it costs nearly twice more expensive ($1500 vs $700). It doesn't make sense for Canon to make a more expensive and less powerful product. The difference obviously is image quality. Remember one thing: You get what you paid for.Further reading:I highly recommend to compare the image quality using the tools developed by The-Digital-Picture.com. You can easily find the link by searching ""Canon Review"" on Google. Go to Tools --> Image Quality and try to play around with different lens, aperture and focal length. That will give you the best side-by-side comparison. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3430, 3444)",2,0.0,False

The connection to this device from my iPad and HTC One kept on dropping.This product does not support Wireless-N 5GHz band and all my devices at home (my iPad, MacBook Pro, HTC One, Samsung Smart TV, Synology NAS, Samsung Bluray player) are connected either via LAN or via 5GHz band. I suspect this could be the reason why this didn't work properly.As a product, my feelings are explained below.Pros:- Price is great; it costs only $35 compared to most set-top boxes which cost around $100- Form factor is very small; it is a HDMI dongle and you can put it in your HDTV's HDMI port although you need to power it from a USB source.- It can cast contents from Chrome web browser (laptop or desktop) but mobile chrome is not supported. You can cast YouTube, Netflix and Google Play contents from mobile devices.- It is not a screen mirroring device (like AirPlay of AppleTV); it uses cloud. i.e. you can stream a YouTube video from your mobile device and can switch off the device, the play on your TV won't stop. And, you can manage that video from your chrome browser.Cons:- Works only in USA at the moment and Google has a bad habit of keeping things in &#34;beta&#34; mode for very long time (e.g. Gmail).- Supports only 2GHz band of your WiFi. This is one of the significant limitations. A device made in the year 2013 has no support for 5GHz; are you kidding? We are talking about WiFi AC standard and this crap doesn't support part of Wireless-N (5GHz)!! This will have impact on 1080p video (sampled at 20+ mbps while shooting) streaming for sure.- Very limited app support at the moment; it only supports YouTube, Netflix and Google Play (music and video). heck! my TV has both YouTube and Netflix app built-in and my android phone has YouTube Remote App; another $35 on such a device is not worth (at least at this moment).- HD video streaming is not as smooth as expected. It has lags and I could see framing issue in the videos (looks like some of the frames reach with some delay) while casting a 1080p YouTube video from my HTC One to TV.- Heavy dependency on High speed internet (and yet it does not support 5GHz band!!)- You cannot play your local files (audio/video); heck! my android device can play those using a DLNA-UPnP app. And, most HDTVs come with DLNA feature, so this is not a compelling need from this device, but it would definitely a nice-to-have. Plus, many people tried playing local content by opening those in Chrome browser and then casting it, but result is not good. The contents are too slow.

You may consider this product if you have TWO devices that support HDMI 1.4. For these, the cable will carry through HD images and Ethernet data therefore eliminating the need for one dedicated Ethernet cable and one Ethernet port. Again, on a pair of connected HDMI 1.4 devices, it will eliminate the need of a dedicated audio cable if, let's say, your TV needs to send sound back to your receiver - it may have a built-in Blu/DVD player or get its input through an USB port. You may also consider this cable if you currently need an extra HDMI 1.3 cable but you are planning to to replace your existing equipment with some HDMI 1.4 ready hardware in the near future.As far as HDMI 1.4 stands, this cable is 'it'. It's the complete implementation because it supports ALL HDMI 1.4 features.HOW GOOD IS IT?- Behaves as a HDMI 1.3x 'high speed' or 'category 2' cable.- As a 'high speed' HDMI 1.4 cable, it supports video resolutions of at least 1080p and can go as high as 4K.- The 'data channel' (Ethernet support) works only with HDMI 1.4 ready equipment.- The 'audio return channel' is another feature supported by HDMI 1.4 ready equipment only. It will allow for audio to be sent 'back' from, let's say a TV to the HDMI 1.4 compliant receiver, therefore eliminating the need for a dedicated audio cable.- It should support all the HDMI 1.4 extra color palettes because those are implemented by the HDMI 1.4 compliant connected equipment.You may want to get this cable even if your equipment is not HDMI 1.4, it doesn't hurt to get a wire that supports a higher standard and, with free shipping the price difference is not that great. And, keep in mind that Amazon stands behind this product so returns should be easy.END OF REVIEW______________________________________________________What follows is the byproduct of me attempting to clarify 'HDMI 1.4' for myself and understanding this specific product's features. I thought I'd share.WHAT'S IN A NAME? (understanding this cable's features)- HDMI 1.4 is a new HDMI standard adopted in 2009, backward compatible with HDMI 1.3. This cable should work with your existing equipment.- HIGH SPEED indicates that this cable supports resolutions of 1080p or higher and 3D video (unlike the HDMI 1.4 STANDARD cables which, believe it or not, are limited to 720p/1080i - why? nobody knows).- ETHERNET means that this cable supports a full-duplex 100 Mb/sec Ethernet connection - if you have 2 HDMI 1.4 ready devices and they both need an network connection, this cable will carry through the Ethernet datastream to the second device, therefore saving you the need for one extra Ethernet cable.- Audio Return Channel is a feature that would save you the need of a dedicated audio cable between 2 HDMI 1.4 compliant devices.- This cable should support the full set of 3D features found in the new TVs.THE HDMI 1.4x DIFFERENCEHDMI 1.4 allows for the following new features:- Ethernet Channel - allows for the 2 connected devices to communicate with each other and share one network connection.- Audio Return Channel - eliminates the need of a second cable if you want to send audio from your TV back to your receiver.- 3D - It's supported by HDMI 1.3x but HDMI 1.4a specifically supports all the currently agreed-upon industry standards- 4K resolution - good to have it but there is nothing on today's market that would take advantage of this- Expanded support for new color spaces - by supporting sYCC601, AdobeRGB, and AdobeYCC601 it better aligns your display with the color spaces supported by digital cameras.- Type D connector - the 'Micro' connector is to be used by small, portable devices with supported resolutions of up to 1080p.The HDMI Consortium defines 4 broad types of HDMI 1.4 cables:* Standard HDMI Cable* High Speed HDMI Cable* Standard HDMI Cable with Ethernet* High Speed HDMI Cable with EthernetOf the above, only the 'High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet' (this one) makes sense and it's likely to emerge as the common HDMI 1.4 cable.Standard cables are limited to lower-resolution displays up to (approx. 720p or 1080i). High Speed cables support higher-resolution display (e.g. 1080p). They can deliver all video content currently defined for the HDMI standard (i.e. more than two 1080p/60 video streams, including 3D). HDMI cables with Ethernet are capable of sending 100/mbps over the HDMI Ethernet Channel. Since it is not likely that many HDMI 1.4 'standard' cables will be made or sold, I suspect that the crippled 'standard' type exists only to allow for calling the cables that support 1080p 'high speed' which sounds good and high-end.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt; ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(4791, 4805)",2,0.0,False

This is my second tablet and I compare a lot of my expectations for a tablet to the Vizio tablet which I loved and never had a problem with, but wanted more memory than 4GB.First off, the Lenovo K1 has a nice big/bright display. I have watched a few Amazon instant videos and YouTube clips and they look great. The speakers are small but don't sound too bad, but this is no Bose system either. The K1 comes with a ton of apps and some are the full/pay versions such as Documents to Go. I have deleted some of the preloaded apps and have used the included Android market and Lenovo market to download other apps as well as the Amazon app market. The K1 also has GPS built in and has the Google navigation app that is pretty cool, but I will probably still use my Garmin due to it being smaller for use in my car. The K1 doesn't weigh too much and is not too bulky either. The performance is pretty fast and I have had no lags of opening or closing apps.Before I bought the Lenovo K1 I did a lot of research and saw many mixed reviews. After unboxing my K1, I updated the software to the latest version and then performed a factory reset. My K1 works perfectly and I do not have the crashing, forced closure of apps, of system freezes that many have complained about and wonder if they updated to the 829 software build(latest version as of now)and performed a factory reset if that might fix their problems.My suggestion is to go to a brick and mortar store such as Office Depot and try the Lenovo K1 out for yourself. If you like it, buy it from Amazon and save yourself some money aswell as the tax and you also get free shipping. With the money saved, you can buy a nice case to put your k1 in.*** July 2012 Update.***While my K1 has been pretty much trouble free, I can no longer recommend the K1 or any other Lenovo product. Lenovo's support of its product is pretty poor. Lenovo has an accessory called a USB host cable that makes it possible to hook up USB objects to the K1. The USB host cable was included with the K1 in Europe and other overseas locations but not in the US, when enough people complained, Lenovo received a small amount and took over a month to distribute what they had. Most owners missed out as you had only about 48 hours to order this cable and the only notification that lenovo was going to sell this cable was on a forum on thier website. Lenov also promised owners of the K1 an update to the newest version of the android software 4.0, so far Lenovo has not deliverd and the release date keeps slipping and may never arrive.Due to these problems, I NO LONGER RECOMMEND LENOVO products.

Living in Texas means a base temperature indoors of about 80F for much of the year and I've had some bad issues with overheating and crashing on my previous rig when playing games.Installation on an Intel based mainboard was painless (AMD looks slightly more intimidating from the manual). In fact, it was not harder than installing a stock cooler and absolutely nothing when compared with the complexity of traditional waterbased cooling systems. It comes with pre-applied thermal paste that does the job just fine, although I suspect you could get even better cooling results with high end thermal paste. The H100 installs very conveniently in the case and does not clutter up the interior at all, which I consider a definite plus.The cooling performance of the product is excellent, and better than what Corsair advertises on the box. The difference to the stock cooler that came with my processor is dramatic, double digit degrees on all settings. The H100 has three speed settings for the fans controlled via a button located on top of the part attached to the CPU. Unless you have an easily accessible case, you will likely not be changing fan speeds very much. There's apparently an additional hardware product that can be used to control the fans from an optional front panel, but I have not found it necessary to change speed away from the minimum setting unless I seriously overlock my CPU.The noise profile of the device is great, but certainly not silent, as long as it is not set to it's maximum speed setting.Some words of caution: This cooler requires some serious space and there are not many cases on the market that will work with it outside the box. On my Level 10-GT gaming case installing it meant removing one of the 210mm fans that came preinstalled to allow installation of this one. Do yourself a favor and do some research if your case has space for the H100 (The grill slightly larger than the 2 fans attached to it).Bottom line: Excellent cooler, comparatively easy installation, decent noise profile.

I know I will not be in a position to take full advantage of this router's features for a while because most of my devices lack 5GHz capability but in spite of that there is  no doubt it will help overall network performance. While it appears to be positioned at the modest end of the manufacturer's dual band router product line, there is nothing modest about its' usefulness.Using the resource mini-cd for the setup assistant application, basic installation was completed in less than ten minutes, not factoring in the number of individual devices I needed to reconfigure to identify the new SSID(s) and password(s).  In order to create guest networking, a firmware update from the TP-LINK's website has to be installed. It should be noted the downloaded files must be extracted using WinZip or WinRAR, which might encumber some casual users. If the intention is to continue to use the Assistant app, there also appears to be another firmware update required to coincide with the other the other firmware modifications, as I discovered when I lost connectivity and couldn't restore it via the CD copy.  I didn't download it as I have enough familiarity with router configuration that I had already decided to log onto the administrative page and make manual changes before I realized there was a fix available.With theoretical transfer rates up to 300Mbps over both the 2.4GHZ and 5GHZ bands which results in the published combined rate of 600Mbps,  the router has already proven to be a nice step forward for my home/ home office network even though most of my activity will remain on the lower bandwidth at `g' standard. With two detachable external antennas, I would rate overall signal strength as good but not outstanding over 2.4GHZ. On the alternate band, degradation to some problematic areas in my house was evident (and expected) yet tolerable without with use of a range extender or access point.On a laptop where I swapped the existing adapter for a dual band `n' standard adapter I experienced an immediate consistent increase from the customary 36 to 46Mbps I was used to to 84Mbps via 5GHZ. That will be beneficial for streaming music and video files and networked backups to and from my media server and NAS. I'm sure most users will also be aware the 5GHZ band will only be visible on devices with dual band adapter capability and network names have to be segregated. As expected, WAN transferal over either band was not improved significantly as ISP limitations come into play there although there did appear to be a slight improvement as interference from other networks in my area is minimal on the 5GHz band.Naturally, some of us want caviar at catfish prices so it would have been great if the router had gigabit ethernet ports but it does have a USB port for networking printers and storage devices , freeing up another ethernet port for another device. It also has a power switch, a convenience absent on many devices in this price range, and  wireless on/off switch which is convenient for disabling broadcasts when one is away but needs to leave the network running for some processes like scheduled backups to a networked storage device.One interesting thing was I swapped out my normal adapters for the TP-LINK WDN 3200 thinking paired products from the same manufacturer might marginally improve performance but it turned out the opposite was true. On a laptop and older desktop PC, signal strength was actually lessened by 20% I tend to believe that may be attributable to the adapters lack of external antenna. I did not try the USB type adapter with an external cord which could have impacted results by facilitating different angles. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3790, 3804)",1,0.0,False

After using it for a while, I stop noticing it, but when you're thinking about it, it's terrible.There are definitely better 50mm's that you could buy, but I couldn't believe the photo quality that I got for $100. Overall, I'm happy with my decision. Despite having a terrible build, it's my most used lens. Actually, come to think of it, because I use it so much, I probably should have bought the f/1.4. Hm. Think about it. But just keep in mind that you can't go wrong with this lens. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1177, 1191)",1,0.0,False

In short they simply outperform a lot of the more expensive 2.1 speaker sets out there.  These speakers won't annoy the neighbors any time soon, but they produce a deep bass and the sound is very clear and crisp. So if I am listening to music or playing games I am very happy with these speakers.  While other speaker sets with a subwoofer actually have the speaker cone exposed without any protection while this one is completely enclosed.  It may not be important to others, but since you usually put the subwoofer on the floor I appreciate the extra protection.

No it is not like some super concert hall quality set, but for the price it really delivers. I have seen all the various reviews of people complaining of anemic performance(not about this product, but in general) and I always wonder what people expect out of a 2.1 system. For I would say 80% of one's general audio needs, this is a great buy. If you want to shake the pictures off the wall, then maybe go for another package.On a basic user level, I like this unit because all the controls are located on a remote that sits on the desktop. Having to reach under the desk to adjust the bass is not necessary. Also, the various inputs/outputs are located in the same remote. The only complaint I have is that ergonomically, the remote is a bit unbalanced in the various controls - the volume knob is huge and the base is a bit hidden on the side. But that is really small potatoes overall.Regarding the actual sound, it is fine for what it is. Decent bass, the highs and overall frequency balance is fine. As with most audio setups, if you do not have an equalizer on your computer, see about getting one. While this unit is ok in its flat response, it certainly can use some tweaking to get it just right.Overall - especially in terms of price to performance - this is an A+ product. If you are some crazy audiophile, you may not be completely impressed. But for the vast majority of users out there, this is a very affordable and effective computer audio solution.
